        "Content": "Objective Understand how to keep using your license/subscriptions/purchased items after merging account. How does Account Merging work? Checking Subscription info What happens to my subscription cycle? Consolidating Email Accounts (Multiple Email Accounts) [Important] This article refers to Individual User in CLO Virtual Fashion. If you are an Enterprise user, your software usage will NOT change with the account merging process. Read more on Individual vs. Enterprise. Details 1) How does Account Merging work? The account merging process is based on the email address registered on your current account. It simply links all accounts with the same email address. Account Merging does NOT impact your license or subscription status, or other account info. If you are using multiple emails, please refer to this guide for further directions. What DOES change What does NOT change software log in will be done using the merged account for CLO, Marvelous Designer 2024.0 and onward website log in will be done using the merged account subscriptions license purchased items in CONNECT assets stored in CLO-SET 2) Checking Subscription Info Upon completing the account merging process, your account information will remain. You will continue with full access to the software license, purchased items, and subscriptions as done in your current account. This applies to all users, regardless of the number of services you are registered to, as long as you have the same email address registered. If you are using different emails, you can: 1) consolidate your account emails OR 2) keep using 2 different merged accounts. You may check further subscription status and account information on you account page: CLO3D Marvelous Designer CLO-SET CONNECT Find more instructions on how to keep using service upon completing the merging process: Using CLO3D Using Marvelous Designer Using CLO-SET 3) What happens to my subscription cycle if I change my account email? Changing your account email will NOT impact your subscription cycle or payment information. Please note that the email notifications on the renewal and payment confirmation will be sent to your original email registered at the point of subscription. 4) Consolidating Email Accounts (Multiple Email Accounts) Ideally, your account merging process should be done automatically, as long as your accounts are registered with the same email address. However, we understand that this may not be the case. If you have multiple emails registered across CLO Virtual Fashion services, the account merging process will lead to multiple CLO-SET (merged) accounts. Your asset/data/subscription will NOT be synced between different CLO-SET (merged) accounts. Resolution: choose 1 main email address to be used moving forward, and contact support team by submitting a request.",
