        "Transcript": "hello everyone my name is jess and i'm going to take you through a couple of different tips for creating realistic looking drawstrings there's already a video that shows you how you can thread a drawstring all the way through the tunnel and i'll link that below because it's really fantastic and you should definitely take a look at it however that technique when you're just starting out is a little bit more advanced and more difficult to stabilize so we wanted to offer some additional techniques that show you how you can create a realistic looking drawstring look without actually having to thread it all the way through the tunnel we're going to go through a couple of different methods in this video and the first method we'll actually be sewing a drawstring to a transparent piece using either a button or a trim for the eyelet and i'll show you how you can make your own draw cords in the second method you'll actually tack the drawstring through a hole with a pattern piece eyelet and we'll use draw cords that are already in the closed default library in the third method it'll be a little bit more of a buttonhole opening with a draw cord and we'll tuck the draw cord just inside the tunnel all three of these techniques are really easy and it totally depends on the look that you're going for and at the end i'll show you one additional tip that will make it look like there's a drawstring in the tunnel without you actually having to thread it through yourself i highly suggest watching the entire video because you can kind of mix and match the techniques in here to suit your needs or the look that you're going for all right let's make some drawstrings okay let's get started with method number one you can see here i have a sweatpant and it's a double layer waistband and that's how i'm going to utilize that for the drawstring effect also i've already gone in and figured out where i want my eyelet to go using internal lines if you don't know how to use internal lines yet or use the internal polygon or internal lips tools i highly suggest going back to the beginner's guide to glow and just making sure you understand how you can mark out your eyelet area to get to exactly where you'd like it to be all right so i have my internal ellipse already shape here so i'm just going to click on that and i'm actually going to use the edit pattern tool to cut that out so i'm just going to cut and sew those pieces out switching to the transform pattern tool just so that i can move those tiny little pieces out of the way just so they're not like overlapping in my 2d window these pieces are really tiny so i'm also going to lower the particle distance they're already on five but you could do two or three just because they're so tiny and any time you're changing particle distance you want to turn on your simulation for a sec now the way that this method works is we're actually sewing our draw cords to a transparent piece so i'm going to go into the fabric tab of my object browser click that add button and apply the fabric to those two little circles that i just cut out where my eyelets will be just to keep things organized i'm going to relabel that transparency in the property editor for that material i'm going down to where it says opacity i'm going to change the opacity of that material all the way to zero so it looks like in the 30 window there's no piece there even though there is a piece there we're going to utilize that to our advantage to give the eyelet effect this time we're going to use a button but you could also use a trim and just glue that trim into this location if you'd like i have the button tool i'm just going to click once on each of these to a place where my eyelet will go now that's the clone default button but we're going to adjust it to make it look more like an eyelet in the button tab object in the object browser you can click on that button that's applied then you can go into the property editor for it where it says shape there are some defaults that come with glow and a few of them have more of an eyelet look i like to use this one right here for the eyelet and you can always change the width as well as the depth so i'm going to change mine to 16 line to kind of match a little bit more of the hole that i have there for the eyelet and i'm going to make it a little bit deeper uh with the thickness also just for fun if you want to go in and apply a material type like metal to make it look even more like a little metal eyelet you can totally do that now we're actually going to sew a draw cord to that little transparent piece that we applied the button to so i want to turn off the collision on these two buttons so i'm going to grab my select move button tool i'm going to select both of those buttons and in the property editor you'll see collision i'm going to uncheck collision because i don't want there to be any collision on these buttons because i'm going to sew fabric right in between them and i don't want them to start jumping around the other thing that i'm going to do is i'm just going to push these a little bit further into the fabric you can see they're kind of a little bit away that's totally fine and now that i have collision off i just really want them to be in just the right spots but you can always adjust them once you add your draw chords in too so let's make the draw chords now again if you've never used any of the shape tools before there are some great tutorials in the beginner's guide to clothe that you can start with but i'm going to create a rectangle that's 3 8 wide by 7 inches long keep in mind you could always change the length of these later um once you've got it kind of stitched into place you can make it whatever like length you want that drawstring to be and i'm just going to add a new fabric and apply it to the straw cord so that it is not transparent i'm going to really love that too i'm going to start with just making one because i can easily duplicate my work to the other side after i can see where this draw cord is in the 2d window and i want it to be a little bit closer to where i'm actually going to stitch it to in 3d so i'm going to move my mouse into 3d activate that little target in the corner of the gizmo and then left click once to put it down closer to where i would like it to be i'm also just going to maneuver it with the gizmo to make it even closer so that the cord doesn't really have that far to go when i eventually stitch it to the little transparent piece it doesn't really need to be perfect but once i turn simulation on i don't want it to have like a super long way to travel to its spot it's also a really skinny piece so i'm going to change the particle distance down to five maybe three or something like that later if i want to um just because it is so small all right so now we need something to stitch it to and to make it look natural i'm going to create an internal line with the internal polygon line tool that doesn't quite reach either end and has a little bit of some angles to it so i'll click once to start and i'm going to put a couple of points down to give it kind of like a zigzag look and i'm going to stitch the entire end of the dark word to that so i'll grab my free sewing tool click once to start click once to end and then do the same thing on the draw cord you can always adjust this later so it really doesn't need to be perfect the first time when i simulate it's going to stitch to that little hole and don't worry if your button moves you could always adjust that a little bit later i think it's important to get your draw cord into the right spot first and looking as naturally as you want it to look just going to lower my particle distance a little bit more so it's even more obvious um the way that's kind of exiting this little tunnel here that already is looking pretty good but if you wanted to you could go in and move some of the points around to get it into just the right spot where it feels like it's kind of going through the jaw cord and then out the hole um i'm kind of purposely making the length of this line a little bit shorter than the draw cord itself i believe there is a slight difference here so that it kind of gathers in and does what it would normally do if you had like a wider draw cord exiting a little eyelet tunnel it should look something like this if you need to just as i was saying before you could just sink this into the fabric a little bit more as needed to get it into just the right spot i've done all of that on one side and i can easily duplicate my work to the other side so i'll click on that draw cord and then i'm going to hit ctrl d on my keyboard and just left click once to put that down in the 3d window if it's super far away you might want to just move it a little bit closer before you simulate because the particle distance on it is so low um and yeah it looks pretty good you might need to adjust the button on that side as well we don't have collision on right now just get it into just the right spot where it looks like a real eyelet all right that is looking really good on to the next method all right time for method number two i have the same setup as i did with the first method where i already figured out where i want my eyelet to go but we'll do it a little bit differently this time you can use your transform or edit pattern tool to again cut out this little hole where the eyelet is going to go and i'm just moving the eyelets to just kind of isolate them up here they are a really tiny piece so i am going to lower the particle distance on these pieces i'm gonna do two really whatever you can get away with under five and simulate just for a sec to let it change to that particle distance um so now i'll grab my edit pattern tool and this is where this will start to change a little bit and i'm going to if you just double click on one section of a shape it'll take uh pick up that whole shape um and then you can right click and go to offset as internal line once i have offset internal line i'm just going to offset whatever i'd like the width of the like rim of that eyelet to be so i'm just doing a really small 1.1 and then i'll press ok that shape that we just made that's going to be converted to a hole so you can just keep that whole shape selected right click convert to hole so now you have the eyelet which is going to be a pattern piece this time with a little hole in the center now let's apply a different fabric to this just as we did before so you can select those pieces apply a new fabric and you can go in and re-label that as well i'm going to label it as eyelet and for this fabric i am actually going to just so you can really see it apply material type preset of metal and i'm going to change the physical property of this material so you can go down to the very bottom where it says physical property and then you can go into detail generally i wouldn't kind of adjust too many of these parameters unless you really know what you're doing and know what all of these things mean but i want this these two pieces to behave very very stiff there is a physical property for trim hardware so if you want to use that preset you can otherwise you can just max out the first six and that should give you a pretty good ideas one two three four five six i can get a few more but that's okay um and when you simulate that should behave like a really stiff eyelet which is exactly the look that we're going for the last thing i'm going to do to these two little pattern pieces is select them and then i'm going to increase the additional rendering thickness of them i'm just going to do one you could do like 1.5 or something like that whatever whatever look you'd like to achieve here and just make sure you're on thick textured surface so you can see the additional thickness rendering that you've applied all right that is looking good so let's open our library now and we're going to use the default library coordinates that come in the library i'm going to use chord number two and i'm using the zpac file because that'll actually be a real pattern piece in chloe um make it super easy for me to apply and then adjust later if i want to so i just right clicked on it and added to workspace i can see that they're both here kind of in front of my avatar's body but if i select them i can move them down and into the spot where i would like them i'm gonna get them really close to where i'm actually going to be attaching them to just so they don't have a far distance to travel and kind of swing around when we're tacking them into their spots so i'm getting them close but i'm not getting them so close that they start to bump into anything so that's something to keep in mind like i don't want it to start going through my garment at all i just want it to be as close as i can just about here should be totally fine now we could sew this if we wanted to but instead let's do something different let's use the tack tool so you can grab the tack tool in the 3d window and it's going to kick you into textured surface so you won't be able to see the full thickness of your material or pieces i like to turn to the side because otherwise these draw chords are just a little bit difficult to see and i'll click once to start the tack then i'll change my perspective and look directly through the eyelet so i can click right in the center and it goes right through that little hole to the other side so i'll do the same thing here clicking once at the top of that draw cord and then looking straight on and just clicking right through in my 2d window i can even see where those are tacked through i'll just switch back to the select move tool and when i turn on my simulation it's going to tack these little draw cords through the hole now you can stop here if you wanted to or you could just move these texts slightly which can just help a little bit with the realism so i'm going to grab the edit tag tool now and in my 2d window you could also move it in your 3d window but i think it's easier in 2d i'm just going to move these slightly to the side so that the draw cord doesn't just go directly through the hole it actually goes a little bit inside the hole and it looks even more realistic after i've moved those tacks i'm just going to turn on my simulation for a second and as long as it's still going right through your eyelet hole you are good to go all right method number three i've already marked out where i'd like this little buttonhole drawcord opening to go with a line and an internal rectangle we're going to convert that internal rectangle to a hole with your edit or transform pattern tool you can just right click convert to hole now that we have the hole where that draw cord is going to exit from we need to add some top stitch so i'm going to grab my free topstitch tool just out of habit because i know if i double click in one of the corners of this it will add the top stitch all the way around without me having to like move my mouse around um and then this is just out of habit but if you want to grab your internal polygon line tool and just create two little internal lines sticking out the top and the bottom i'll show you why we're doing this in a second so internal polygon line tool you can click once to start and double click to end just a little line i'm just kind of eyeballing it to be honest but you can do this however you'd like to now let's customize that top stitch that's applied here so you can go to the top stitch tab in your object browser and find that stitch then i'm going down to specification and we're going to change the shape from custom to bartek uh so it gives you that nice close together stitch which can make it look like a little buttonhole opening you can also change the offset to whatever you'd like it to be i've been changing it to zero because i feel like it gives me just the right amount of the stitch that i'm looking for and then you can also go in with your segment topstitch tool and add that same stitch to those tiny little internal lines that you need um you'll make it even better than me and make it look like it's um really continuous but that's kind of the way that i've been achieving this back effect in a quick and easy manner all right that's looking pretty good and you could always further customize the color and the look and all of that too let's go in and add the draw cord now so i'm going to grab my rectangle tool again and i'm going to click once in the 2d window to bring up the create rectangle and i'm going to do 0.25 wide because i know that's going to fit within the buttonhole that i've already made and 7 inches long knowing i can always make it longer later if i want to this will just be a starting point i'm also just going to move this into an organized spot in my 2d window add a new fabric just for the draw cord you could even label it just so you are keeping everything nice and organized for later all right so i need to find this in my 3d window now you can select it in either window but i'm just looking for it in 3d so i can activate the target in the corner of the gizmo to move this really fast to where i want it to go i'm going to tip this over you can always use the target again to get it even closer because we are going to actually have this coming like slightly through the opening that we made so i'm just going to get it into just an approximate position now i know the distance from center front to my opening is 1.5 and i want this to look like it's somewhat inside the tunnel so i'm going to do it three inches away from center front you can do this however you'd like to so i'm grabbing my internal polygon line tool clicking once to start and then i'll right click to bring up the precision box and make it three inches away um you can do this really however you would like to that's just to mark where i want the draw cord end to be stitched to trust the process i'll i'll let you know um why we're doing this later and then i'll make a little internal line for it to be stitched to you can be more precise than i'm being also in terms of the exact placement um i'm just going to move that into that spot so that's what we're actually going to stitch the end of the draw cord to that little internal line which is not on the first layer it's on the interior layer so it's going to be slightly inside the tunnel which makes it look really nice and is just a little bit less work than having to do all of it all right i'm also going to fold my draw cord which just makes it easier to insert in the tunnel so i'm going to click on the end of the draw cord and go to offset as internal line and i'm going to do 1.5 and that's just the amount that it's actually going to be tucked into the tunnel before it actually exits through the draw cord so i'll grab my fold arrangement tool in the 3d window and i'm going to use that internal line to actually fold this so that little fold right there that's where it's going to exit the tunnel i've just found this makes it a little bit easier for me to insert into the tunnel and i'm using my gizmo to actually insert that what i tend to do is get it really close and really level and even before i push it into the surface of the fabric and making sure that it's actually at the exit point where the little draw cord is then i'll push that back directly and it really does not need to be perfect right away this might take a couple of tries but i promise it gets easier with time so i've sunk that into the surface of the fabric i'm going to grab my segment sewing tool and just stitch the end to that little internal line which again is on the second layer i'm using shift q on my keyboard to hide and show pieces if anyone is wondering you can also right click and hide your 3d pattern when you have it selected so when i hit shift q i can see it's sitting in the tunnel that's great but if i have any worry at all about actually staying in the tunnel i'll grab my select mesh box tool and actually select the area of the mesh like right here on the top layer and just pull that forward a little bit just so i have a greater chance of it actually staying in the tunnel when i end up simulating one last super important thing is we've made a skinny little tiny piece draw cord and we need to lower the particle distance um i'm going to do like four you want to do like five something small especially for how skinny this is before you simulate all right let's see how it goes when we simulate now and if it stays in the tunnel that is doing pretty good so it's slightly inserted into the tunnel and just sewn to that little internal line that you saw we can even hide this piece to take a look at it gives you the effect of going all the way through the tunnel you can kind of see like the impression of where it is without actually having to go all the way through the tunnel and you can duplicate that work to the other side really easily just by clicking on that piece with the transform pattern tool hitting control d on your keyboard you might have to move it slightly and do some of the same adjusting that you saw me do on the other side as well and i'll just do that real quick nice and that's method number three all right i've got one more tip for you to make it look like there's a drawstring running all the way through your tunnel without having to do a lot of work so i'm going to copy and paste the interior waistband so just copying and pasting the interior waistband then i'm going to grab my edit pattern tool and cut off the top section and the bottom section all i'm doing is isolating the middle section of my interior waistband and you could do this a number of different ways depending on what your waistband construction is using your trace tool or copy and pasting and cutting areas away now i'm going to sew this little piece that i made that's just that middle section of the interior waistband i'm going to sew the top to that first internal line and the bottom to that second internal line so i'm basically just taking this and stitching it right to here to the interior waistband also just check your particle distance if you haven't already lowered it you're going to want to lower it now in my 3d window i'm going to right click and superimpose it over i'm doing super impose over because it's actually stitched to the interior waistband and i want it to sit right in between the interior and the exterior you can see it looks like a little bit is kind of sticking out through but that's totally fine and easy to fix so i'm going to click on just the exterior waistband now i'm going to set the layer underneath simulation properties the layer i'm going to bring that to layer one so it'll fight its way to the outside when i turn on simulation my exterior layer is going to make sure it's sitting on the outside and that is in turn going to make sure that little piece that i just stitched in stays right in between the exterior and the interior if i hit shift q while selecting the outside i can see there's that little section that i just sewed in now even just having that additional layer there it has its own additional collision thickness it's a little invisible barrier around it so it already looks like there's something a little bit more sitting in that tunnel all the way around without having to like thread it through yourself but if you wanted to even beef up that you could go to the transform pattern tool click on that little piece and increase the collision even more so i'm going to do 4.5 just so you can see something a little bit more intense here and if you look at my 3d window while i simulate you can see that that's even propelling it more away from 4.5 millimeters from the other pieces around it that it stitched to so it kind of looks like there's a drawstring going through my entire tunnel i hope this video was helpful for different ideas for drawstring expressions don't forget you

        "Summary": "# Comprehensive Guide to Creating Realistic Drawstrings ## Introduction In this guide, we will explore various methods for creating realistic-looking drawstrings for garments using a software called Clo3D. We will cover three main techniques for achieving this effect, along with a bonus tip to enhance the visual realism of drawstrings without threading them through the entire tunnel. ## Method 1: Sewing a Drawstring to a Transparent Piece with an Eyelet ### Step-by-Step Instructions 1. **Set Up Your Garment**: Start with a garment that has a double-layer waistband (e.g., sweatpants). 2. **Mark Eyelet Location**: Use internal lines to determine where the eyelet will go. Refer to the beginner's guide on using internal lines if necessary. 3. **Cut Out Eyelet Holes**: - Select the internal ellipse shape. - Use the Edit Pattern tool to cut out the holes for the eyelet. - Move the tiny pieces out of the way with the Transform Pattern Tool. 4. **Adjust Particle Distance**: Lower the particle distance to 2 or 3 for better simulation accuracy due to the small size of the pieces. 5. **Create Transparent Eyelet**: - Go to the Fabric tab in the Object Browser. - Add a new fabric for the eyelet holes and set its opacity to 0 to make it transparent. 6. **Add Eyelet (Button or Trim)**: - Use the Button tool to place buttons where the eyelets are marked. - Adjust the button shape to resemble an eyelet and apply a metallic material if desired. 7. **Disable Collision on Buttons**: Select the buttons and uncheck the collision property to avoid movement issues during simulation. 8. **Create Draw Cords**: - Use the Rectangle tool to create a draw cord (3/8\" wide by 7\" long). - Add a new fabric to this rectangle for visibility. 9. **Position the Draw Cords**: - Move the draw cord closer to the eyelet in the 3D window. - Adjust particle distance for smaller pieces. 10. **Stitch Draw Cord to Transparent Eyelet**: - Create an internal line for the draw cord to stitch into. - Use the Free Sewing Tool to stitch the draw cord to the internal line. 11. **Simulate**: Turn on simulation to see the draw cord in action. ### Tips and Tricks - Adjust the length of the draw string as needed after stitching. - Use the Select Move tool to reposition elements for a more natural look. --- ## Method 2: Tack the Drawstring Through an Eyelet Hole ### Step-by-Step Instructions 1. **Set Up and Mark Eyelet Location**: Similar to Method 1, determine where the eyelet will go. 2. **Cut Eyelet Hole**: Cut out a hole for the eyelet and adjust particle distance as necessary. 3. **Create Eyelet**: Use the Offset as Internal Line feature to create a rim for the eyelet and convert it to a hole. 4. **Apply a Stiff Material**: - Select the eyelet pieces and apply a metal material type. - Increase physical properties to make it behave stiff. 5. **Add Draw Cords from Library**: - Open the default library and select a draw cord from the library. - Position it near the eyelet hole. 6. **Use Tack Tool**: - Select the Tack Tool in the 3D window. - Click on the top of the draw cord and then through the eyelet hole to secure it. 7. **Adjust Positioning**: Use the Edit Tack Tool to slightly move the tacks for a more realistic look. 8. **Simulate**: Turn on simulation to see how the draw cord appears through the eyelet. ### Tips and Tricks - Ensure the tacks are positioned correctly to avoid intersecting surfaces. - Adjust the simulation settings to achieve the desired look. --- ## Method 3: Buttonhole Drawcord Opening ### Step-by-Step Instructions 1. **Mark Buttonhole Location**: Use an internal rectangle to mark where the buttonhole will be. 2. **Create Buttonhole**: Convert the internal rectangle to a hole. 3. **Add Top Stitch**: Use the Free Topstitch Tool to add a top stitch around the buttonhole. 4. **Add Draw Cord**: Create a rectangle for the draw cord (0.25\" wide and 7\" long). 5. **Position Draw Cord**: Use the Gizmo to position the draw cord correctly in the 3D window. 6. **Create Internal Lines for Stitching**: Mark where the draw cord will be stitched inside the tunnel. 7. **Fold Draw Cord**: Use the Offset as Internal Line tool to create a fold for the draw cord. 8. **Stitch the Draw Cord**: Use the Segment Sewing Tool to attach the draw cord to the internal line. 9. **Simulate**: Turn on simulation to see the draw cord appear as if it is exiting the buttonhole. ### Tips and Tricks - Adjust the fold of the draw cord for a more realistic appearance. - Make sure the particle distance for the draw cord is set appropriately to avoid visual issues. --- ## Bonus Tip: Creating the Illusion of a Drawstring in the Tunnel ### Step-by-Step Instructions 1. **Copy and Paste the Interior Waistband**: Isolate the middle section of the waistband. 2. **Sew to Internal Lines**: Attach this middle section to the internal lines of the waistband. 3. **Superimpose Over the Exterior Layer**: Use the Superimpose feature to ensure it sits between the interior and exterior layers. 4. **Adjust Collision Thickness**: Increase the collision thickness to enhance the illusion of a drawstring present in the tunnel. 5. **Simulate**: Turn on simulation to see the effect. ### Tips and Tricks - Use collision settings to push the new layer outward for a more pronounced effect. - Experiment with different materials and thicknesses to get the desired visual outcome. --- ## Conclusion These methods offer various approaches to creating realistic drawstrings in Clo3D.

        "Transcript": "hi my name is phoebe and i'm going to walk you through using the styling tools so the styling tools are really great tools they allow you to kind of like sketch and drape within the clothes 3d window and we're going to go through all of the different tools within that style line um section today so let's jump right on in and have some fun while learning okay so here we have our clothes screen open and we've got our garment all set up this was just like a basic t-shirt and here i'm just gonna hide my library so to do that i'm just going to click on this little arrow here to hide it i'm now going to use these tools over here which are the styling tools the first tool i'm going to use is this move styling tool what this is going to do is it's going to move my um style lines down to the side anyway so i'm just going to do is i'm going to click on my garment you'll then see that this changes and it starts to look kind of like a schematic render basically a sketch and what i'm just going to do is i'm going to hover over the line i'd wish to move and i'm going to just click hold down and you'll see that then all of a sudden it will move i like to simulate after every move and what's nice is when you do have your simulation on you can just click on your garment and start to just drag and move this down and then when you turn off simulation it switches right back to the tool so again i'm going to just drag this down a little bit more now the only thing i want to bring to your all of yours attention is there is a purple number right down here look see okay so this number is telling you exactly what's being changed it's telling you the how much you're lengthening it from here all the way down so you can see exactly how much you're moving it which is really helpful because if you only want to move it like an inch or two inches you can see that here these black measurements here are telling you how much the new length is now that's just fun facts to know always sharing some fun facts so i'm just going to drop this down here i'm just gonna okay now we've got our move tool i think i'm going to just move my sleeve too so i want to lengthen my sleeve a bit you can see that sometimes you can only lengthen it a little um that's just because of where it's at at that moment but um you'll see that the wider it gets then the easier it is to lengthen it then the more you can lengthen it at once okay so now let's go to our scale styling tool which is right above the move style line tool the scale styling tool is going to um like scale the styling basically it's going to make it wider or shorter so here what i'm going to do is i'm going to make my hem a little bit wider this is when seeing the measurements at the same time is really helpful because before you know it you can make it really wide um and you really don't need to make it that wide um i mean you can if you want but i didn't so i'm going to do like 1.7   and then simulate nice so what's nice about all these tools so the move and style line tool does this you can hover over certain sections of the um line like so and you'll see arrows see an arrow you don't see it no yes you see an error now you can click and hold down and now what you can do is you can make this larger but just the side seam so just the side seam is going to become longer and like wider instead of the center front and side seam so this is deciding exactly where you're adding the width to again if you go to the longer line it'll become longer if you go to the shorter line it will go shorter same with that move tool the bigger arrow is going to make it bigger longer the shorter arrow is going to make it shorter so i'm just gonna add like let's say one one inch 1.4 now i can simulate and everything what i can also do is i can use that arrow again and maybe what i want to do is make sure that my center front is actually straight um and perpendicular to what the top is so i can do that here and just look on my pattern and i can just rotate and do the same to the back nice okay now okay these tools are meant to push limits right like try anything why not um so like don't forget that you could also play around with your neck opening too so what i could do is i could click here and i could scale out my neck opening so that it becomes larger and everything i can also like select certain parts so maybe i just wanted it to become larger at the opening or maybe i wanted the opening to be straight and i wanted this to become larger you know or maybe not you can try any of this it's really nice like you can scale any part of your garment as long as there is a pattern edge to it another really helpful tool is the edit style line tool what this is going to do especially for this neck opening is you're going to be able to select points and adjust them so i can click on this point and drop it down a little bit um maybe i want to select this and bring this in   um actually out a little bit and maybe i actually wanted this to come in a little bit more and i can even click on a line and adjust the line's curve by changing it into a curvature line so that we have bezier handles like so so this is actually pretty good right i think the last thing i'm going to do is actually i'm going to scale my thing so that this goes down because i'm going to do like a handkerchief yeah one of those really fun things all right so now we've got our garment it's looking great the last one we're going to go through is the draw style line tool this is really cool it allows you to create all new style lines within your 3d window here's a tip it's really nice because what you can do is you can turn on translucent surface in your fabric view and then you can see exactly where you're going to um cut it compared to your avatar so like if you wanted a crop top because we're with the times we know what people like you know um i feel like that means i don't um you can see exactly where you want to cut it so that it's the crop you want or maybe you don't want a crop top because you're over that and you're just like no we're doing normal tops that's fine so what you can just do is you can click and you can hold down control if you want and you can create these really nice curves and go all the way straight to the line or you can just release control you don't have to hold down control at all and you can create a straight line right so here i'm just going to go through and i'm going to make a waistband and what's nice is you can see like really how close you can get to accurate um like to this being the same way throughout and everything can't forget the armhole and last but not least the neck so i'm definitely going to have to hold down control for this because i want a nice curve okay and then the back and what's really nice is because everything is symmetrical i've only had to do half of this so that is a win of itself all right now everything's all set so the last thing i'm going to do is i'm going to go back to monochrome view i'm going to go to select and simulate and now what i'm going to do is i'm actually going to edit some sewing so i don't want this sewing relationship i'm going to hit delete and now what i'm going to do is i'm going to go back to my um scale style line tool and i'm going to adjust this waistband so that it fits onto her waist like so all right i continue to use maybe my edit um styling tool to adjust the lines this looks good this actually looks great now what i can do is maybe i want to move this maybe i want this to actually be wider so i can move this up so that this is actually wider maybe not that one great and what i'm also going to do is i'm going to go to this and delete this sewing relationship so that i can adjust this without having to adjust the sleeve and again you can look at your pattern simultaneously to make sure that it's adjusting how you like it and to make sure that they're both adjusting equally right and now i can go back to my sewing and this can be so maybe i just need to make sure that this is straight okay and now i've got my skirt and everything so now we've got a whole new garment and everything we've got a shirt and skirt in a matter of seconds i can continue to play around with this or i can just start adding fabrics if i want so here i can go in maybe i want to open up some fabrics   there we go i can open this up let's say i want my cable net i'm going to add a few and you can just bring this stuff in and apply it and now you've got a whole new garment in a matter of seconds you can just render it out like so and then you're all set thanks so much for watching this video i hope you enjoyed learning a little bit about the style lines and how you can adjust and play around with them all while in the 3d window if you have any questions please feel free to write in the comments please like and subscribe um this channel we have so many great videos for you to watch and learn from thanks so much again for watching i hope you enjoyed you ",
        "Summary": "# Comprehensive Guide to Using Styling Tools in 3D Garment Design ## Introduction This guide walks you through the process of using styling tools in a 3D garment design application, as demonstrated by Phoebe in the provided transcript. The tools allow users to sketch and drape clothes within a 3D window. ## Getting Started ### Step 1: Open the Clothes Screen - Launch your 3D garment design application. - Open the \"Clothes Screen\" where your garment (e.g., a basic t-shirt) is set up. ### Step 2: Hide the Library - Click on the small arrow icon to hide the library for a cleaner workspace. ## Using Styling Tools The styling tools are located in the \"Style Line\" section of your interface. Here's a breakdown of each tool and how to use them. ### 1. Move Styling Tool **Definition**: This tool allows you to move style lines of your garment. #### Instructions: 1. Select the **Move Styling Tool** from the toolbar. 2. Click on your garment to make it active. 3. Hover over the line you want to move. 4. Click and hold the mouse button while dragging the line to your desired position. 5. After moving, use the **Simulate** function to see how the garment looks. 6. The purple number displayed indicates how much you’ve moved the line; use this for precise adjustments. **Tip**: Simulate after every move to visualize changes. ### 2. Scale Styling Tool **Definition**: This tool allows you to adjust the width and length of specific parts of your garment. #### Instructions: 1. Select the **Scale Styling Tool** from the toolbar. 2. Click on the hem or any line you wish to adjust. 3. Drag the arrow to scale the line wider or narrower. 4. Monitor the measurements displayed to avoid making excessive changes. 5. Use arrows to adjust specific sections (e.g., side seam, center front) while keeping others unchanged. **Tip**: Pay attention to how each adjustment affects the overall garment appearance. ### 3. Edit Style Line Tool **Definition**: This tool allows you to modify existing style lines by selecting and adjusting points. #### Instructions: 1. Select the **Edit Style Line Tool**. 2. Click on points of the style line to adjust their position. 3. Use bezier handles to create curves for a more tailored shape. 4. Adjust neck openings or any other specific part of the garment with precision. **Tip**: Experiment with curves and angles for unique designs. ### 4. Draw Style Line Tool **Definition**: This tool lets you create new style lines from scratch. #### Instructions: 1. Select the **Draw Style Line Tool**. 2. Hold down the **Control** key for curved lines or release it for straight lines. 3. Click and drag to create new lines for design elements like waistbands or armholes. 4. Leverage symmetry to avoid duplicating work on both sides of the garment. **Tip**: Use the translucent fabric view to visualize the placement of new lines effectively. ## Final Adjustments ### Editing Sewing Relationships 1. Select the **Sewing Tool** to adjust any existing sewing relationships. 2. Delete unwanted sewing lines using the delete option. 3. Re-adjust the garments as necessary using the previous styling tools. ### Adding Fabrics 1. Open the fabric library to explore different fabric options. 2. Drag desired fabrics into your garment to apply them. 3. Render the final design to visualize the complete look. ## Conclusion You can create and modify garments in just a few steps using the styling tools in a 3D environment. Practice using the move, scale, edit, and draw tools to become more proficient. ### Additional Tips: - Always simulate after adjustments to see real-time changes. - Take advantage of the measurement indicators for precision. - Don’t hesitate to experiment with different styles and configurations. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to leave comments or seek help from the community. Happy designing!"

        "Transcript": "hi my name is Phoebe and today we're going to go through fabric tapes and we're going to focus on the 3D window fabric types so this is actually going to be broken up into three different videos and this is going to be the first one of three and focusing on 3D window fabric types so let's Jump On In and have some fun while we learn okay so here we have our 3D window now in our 3D window we have our fabric types and we can start to play around a little bit before we do though I'm going to turn on my quality render so my quality render lighting is going to adjust the lighting to be a little bit better and so you can see differences a little bit more now you can actually play around with this lighting a little bit so if I go into my environment display and I go to show 3D light I'll then see this little icon that I can click on and over here my property editor I can play around the intensity and the angle I'm going to stick with the default which will be 0 and 1. so you can play around with this a little bit if you want to and see what you what's best for you so now let's all get into fabric types which is the important thing before we get into fabric types there's just one other thing I want to bring up really quickly so if I go into my object browser which I move down below I can select my fabric and then over here in your property editor which is the top for me you'll see type right so you'll see your type right here and right now it's fabric matte matte is great for most fabric types like gabardine twill um any Fabrics that you know aren't super aren't really any shine to it and they're good with mattes now if I use this drop down and change it around you'll see that nothing's changed partly because I don't have simulation on if I turn on simulation though it will still all stay the same what does this mean you may ask well what it means is this very important thing your favorite type does not influence your drape of your fabric okay if you want to influence the drape of the fabric and adjust it in any way that is all done through physical property okay physical property is the only way in which you can in which your fabric is going to change in driving there's other ways that your family changing draping but for this right here this is how you will change your fabric for the drape through physical properties not through fabric type okay not at all only through physical properties it's important which is why I've said it a few times now and in the very beginning of this video okay so don't forget if you want to change the drape it's not through fabric type okay not at all so now let's go into Power type now fabric type for your 3D window the thing that's going to change the most when you change and move these around is your reflection and you can kind of see this as I switch through different types okay so metal my Reflections changed a bit um shiny my reflection is changing a bit matte my reflection changes so you'll see that the reflection for your 3D window fabric types that is the thing that changes now you may start asking yourself or maybe me right now um what is reflection specifically what is this roughness and reflection intensity great question let me tell you reflection intensity increases the amount of light that's going to bounce off of your material so in other words it acts like a white filter for the base color so a material that has high intensity reflects more light so it's going to look a little bit more white and blurry I'm going to show you in a picture right now so this is roughness this is reflection intensity so here we've got a reflection intensity of zero and we're going to move all the way over to 100 and you can see how the higher you go the more you see it the white like um edges of this Fabric and a little bit blurrier it gets that is reflection intensity now let's talk about roughness it's your next option over here right roughness is a little bit different so what roughness does is it decides how much that intensity is going to spread throughout the fabric so a really low number means that there is going to be smaller areas that it's going to reflect okay well as a larger number is going to reflect a larger part of the fabric so that kind of makes sense makes sense when you play around here so at 100 it's a little bit more matted while at zero it's shinier here is a picture I'm going to show you so this is roughness type at 100. well as if I go all the way over here this is it at zero so you can see up zero it's like they're the lights kind of every and a lot of really tiny places so you see it more like bouncing out at you while at 100 it's kind of spreading across the whole um fabric quite nice and even my kind of that my friends is wrong with us so now that we understand what's being changed let's go through all the different types so with this first fabric here the cotton Satin let's select our Fabric and go through our first one our first one is fabric matte now this again is great for cotton twills garberdeen um satin uh many knits it's gonna be great for all of those if I go down to shiny and you'll see that this has changed a bit so here if I zoom in a little bit and I rotate in and all of that you can see that now there's like a little bit of a shine to it this is great for Fabrics that um have a little bit of a shine to them I mainly use this for actually Hardware so whenever I have a button that's like a shell button or something I'll use this because all of these types are not just applied to all of our Fabrics in Globe but also all of our hardware and clothes wow so you can adjust our Hardware types to being like shiny or metal or anything like that   so that's a lot shinier and everything and this is playing around with it a lot what's also Happening Here is with the silk satin what's going to happen is Khloe automatically mixes in a white to the base color to create a higher shine effect which is why you can see like this shine so much more versus just shiny just so cotton cool right okay let's move on to our next fabric so our next fabric is the Velvet we all love velvet it's fun um some people want to drape themselves in velvet out here anyways that's a TV show joke like in case anybody knows um so what happens with our Velvet Let's go into this so here we're gonna go to our velvet here and here we have fabric velvet so for this we do have our reflection changes but if I go to my basic parameters drop down this right here and I click drop down you're actually also going to see that there's been a bit of change over here as well so let me change this to Matt do you see how for my matte fabric I didn't have this extra option for color see there was no drop down for a map for color where velvet there is so when velvet you have two options with your colors you have front color and side color and it's um front color multiplier recycler multiplier okay so for velvets they have a very distinct kind of reflection to them where the sides of it are reflect more than the French color so that's what this is going to play around with if you want this to look realistic then I would make sure that your front color stays between 0.1 and 1. when your side color stays between 10 and 30. if I change my side color to let's say five and my front color to two you see that this no longer really looks like a velvet but if I keep this down to 0.5 and maybe my side color is dirty um 20. sorry the top the highest winning um then you can start to see wow this looks like a lot more realistic maybe I can drop this down to 15. and this one's gonna look better looking really great you'll also see that your reflection does change it's mainly a roughness that's going to be increased while the reflection intensity is going to be all about this color that you play around with okay the next one we're gonna go to is our leather lambskin so let's go into that now our leather for here when we select this you also again see that your reflection is played around a little bit and it's changed the thing that's going to help the most with leather dung is actually your normal map intensity the lower the normal map intensity the less realistic it looks the higher you go the better it is for leather you can also continue to play around with your roughness if you'd like or with anything like this but it's your normal mouth intensity that's going to make your leather look more or less realistic okay now let's go into our metallic so here we have our metal fabric type now for our metal fabric type you see now what's added is one like we've adjusted our roughness and reflection but we've also adjusted this metalness option so you can play around with this little toggle and increase or lower your metalness and this will affect how much um of a reflection this like metalness has on it but another really important thing to know is that this is what metal illness looks like without any color if you add ink color though it will then be adjusted like so it is important though to know that sometimes the color is going to look a little bit different when you have metalness apply so I use this type whenever I have foil prints or stuff like that it's really helpful for all of those things especially for graphics or if I have a ziploader that I know is a middle zipper or a metal button or anything like that and finally we have I'm gonna go down to here we have our plastic plastic is really great again for Hardwares so if you have a plastic button plastic zipper this is going to be great for Fabrics if you want to get a look of a vinyl this is when plastic's really helpful you can play around with the opacity and you can try to get more of a vinyl look again if you go into your color this will then be adjusted and all of that   with your roughness or reflection intensity to get whatever you'd like for your plastic all right well I hope you enjoyed

        "Summary": "# Comprehensive Guide to Working with 3D Window Fabric Types **Introduction:** This guide is based on a video tutorial presented by Phoebe, focusing on the various fabric types available in a 3D modeling environment. The tutorial covers fabric properties, how to manipulate them, and tips for achieving realistic effects. This guide will break down the information into steps, definitions, and tips and tricks for better understanding and practical application. --- ## Step-by-Step Instructions: ### 1. **Setting Up the 3D Window:** - **Open the 3D Window:** - Launch your 3D modeling software and open the 3D window. - **Activate Quality Render:** - Turn on the quality render to improve lighting visibility. - Go to the `Display` menu. - Select `Show 3D Light` to enhance the lighting in the environment. ### 2. **Adjusting Lighting:** - **Use the Property Editor:** - Access the property editor to adjust light intensity and angle. - Set the intensity to 0 (off) and angle to 1 (default). - **Experiment with Lighting:** - Feel free to play around with different intensity levels to see what works best for your project. ### 3. **Understanding Fabric Types:** - **Navigate to Object Browser:** - Move to the object browser and select the fabric you wish to modify. - **Access Property Editor:** - In the property editor, look for the `Type` dropdown menu. - Note that the default is usually set to `Fabric Matte`. ### 4. **Changing Fabric Types:** - **Understanding Fabric Types:** - **Fabric Matte:** Good for non-shiny fabrics (e.g., gabardine, twill, satin). - **Shiny:** Adds a bit of shine, suitable for fabrics with a gloss. - **Metal:** Reflective properties, used for metallic fabrics or hardware. - **Velvet:** Requires special color adjustments for realistic rendering. - **Leather:** Adjust normal map intensity for realistic texture. - **Plastic:** Good for hardware representations, allows for opacity adjustments. ### 5. **Simulation Settings:** - **Turn On Simulation:** - Ensure simulation is activated to see changes reflected in the fabric type. ### 6. **Understanding Reflection Properties:** - **Reflection Intensity:** - Increases the amount of light bouncing off the fabric, affecting brightness and clarity. - Ranges from 0 (no reflection) to 100 (high reflection). - **Roughness:** - Determines how light is spread across the fabric. - Lower values lead to shinier surfaces, while higher values create a matte effect. ### 7. **Working with Velvet Fabrics:** - **Adjusting Color Properties:** - Velvet has unique settings: - **Front Color Multiplier:** Ranges from 0.1 to 1 for realistic front appearance. - **Side Color Multiplier:** Ranges from 10 to 30; adjust for realistic side reflection. ### 8. **Working with Leather Fabrics:** - **Normal Map Intensity:** - Adjust this property to enhance the realism of leather textures. ### 9. **Working with Metallic Fabrics:** - **Metalness Adjustment:** - Use the metalness toggle to control how reflective the fabric appears. - Be aware that adding color can affect the final appearance. ### 10. **Working with Plastic Fabrics:** - **Opacity and Color:** - Adjust opacity settings to mimic vinyl or other plastic appearances. - Play around with roughness and reflection intensity to achieve desired looks. --- ## Definitions: - **Reflection Intensity:** The amount of light reflected off a material; higher values lead to brighter, shinier appearances. - **Roughness:** The texture of a surface that affects how light is distributed; lower values create shiny appearances, while higher values create a matte look. - **Normal Map Intensity:** A parameter that adjusts how surface details are rendered, enhancing realism in textures. - **Metalness:** The degree to which a material reflects light like a metal, affecting visual realism in 3D models. --- ## Tips and Tricks: - **Experiment with Settings:** Don’t hesitate to adjust properties like reflection intensity and roughness to see immediate visual changes. - **Use Reference Images:** Compare your fabric types with real-life fabrics to achieve more realistic results. - **Save Preferences:** If you find a combination of settings you like, save them as a preset for future projects. - **Utilize Comments for Questions:** Engage with the community or the creator for clarifications and tips on specific issues. --- By following these steps and utilizing the definitions and tips provided, you will enhance your understanding and ability to manipulate fabric types in a 3D modeling environment effectively. Enjoy creating!"

        "Transcript": "hello everyone and welcome to this tutorial video where i will show you how to construct a classic string bikini and a bathing suit with two different methods first of all we are going to build up a bikini from existing patterns and then after that we will draw the patterns for the bathing suit directly on the avatar on the 3d window and we will continue from there to build up the bathing suit so i am going to open my library and go to my patterns folder and i am going to open a dxf file right click and add to workspace and here okay in my case i have some half patterns so i need to select edit pattern tool set to be able to do right click on the line in the middle and select unfold symmetric editing with sewing and here as well here as well and here as well now i have some symmetric patterns that i want to select and apply symmetric pattern with sewing doing right click on them with transform pattern tool and now i'm going to do the same for this two here okay now that we have our patterns like this i'm going back to the library and i'm going to go into the avatar folder female v2 and in here i'm going to choose this avatar for instance camilla when we add the avatar we get it with the preset skin texture in this case black underwear to work with lingerie or swimwear we probably want to get rid of this underwear to change the texture i'm going to go in this texture folder and here i have another folder called fb2 camilla in here i have three different images and the last one this one has no underwear so i'm going to go with this one if i go to the avatar and click on her chest in the proper editor i see an image on the texture tab i can select and drag my new texture here to change it i click on it and drag it to the texture tab and here we go now we have a different texture with no underwear now i'm going to select all my patterns and move them a bit up with the gizmo to be able to have a clear view of the avatar and then i can use the arrangement points to locate all the patterns around the avatar first the top now this one then the back something like this okay and now for the piece on the crotch this little piece here i'm not going to use any arrangement point in fact i'm going to deactivate them and what i'm going to do is i'm going to select my free sewing tool to be able to sew this pattern piece to the back in here and then to the front so from here to here then to the front and now i can go to the 3d window to right click on my pattern and search for superimposed side and then this piece will be correctly located like this okay so now what we are going to do is we are going to do the rest of the sewing for that i'm going to select segment sewing tool and i am going to start by sewing the sides on the bottom and now on the top for the strips here so i have some points you can also have notches or you can also work with free sewing tool as you like okay and then in the 3d window we can always check that the threads look okay i'm going to close this start in here and then in this case for the front top part i want the patterns to be crossed so i've selected free sewing tool to get this blue dot which is going to give me the final length that i need for the sewing you can always also try to select the patterns and move them a bit closer to the avatar so when you simulate it's going to be easier and you'll have a better result for that we can also select all the patterns and try to strengthen them so again this will help the simulation let's see okay now while simulating we can also try to do a fitting with the hand and for example for me something like this okay and then on the bottom as well i'm going to pull it up if we hide the avatar with shift a or directly in the toggle bar we see that the crotch this part here is not looking okay so we are going to change the pose of the avatar we go to the toolbar and we activate show x-ray and now we get to see the skeleton and the joints of the avatar if i click on one of these joints my gizmo appears and i can move my leg by using it but over it i have a little figure if i activate it by clicking on it it becomes blue and this means that i can change both legs at the same time by just moving and changing the joint of one of them now that i have spread them i can deactivate the x-ray and simulate again to see it is going to look much better and now it's flat now we want to have the lining for the bikini this is very simple we select all the pattern pieces in the 2d window and do right click on top of them and then we select layer clone under when we do so we get the silhouettes of the new lining patterns appearing and i can place them for instance here and then the lining is not only created but also correctly placed under the shell and all the sewings are already done so if i simulate i see it's perfectly stable so now that we know that everything works we are going to add the ribbon for the top so we go to the library and search for the hardware and trims folder then inside it we go to the ribbon folder in here we have different ribbons but notice that these ones are trims and we want to add them as a garment we want to have the pattern pieces so we go to the pack folder i am going to choose this ribbon shape which i like for example so either right click and select add to workspace now that we have it we can do click on this target here we have next to it on the 3d window which is going to help us relocate the ribbon in my case i want it on the back and now i can select the patterns in the 2d window and relocate them next to where i want to sew it i need to draw an internal line with polygon internal line g in the middle of the back and then on this piece on the middle of the ribbon so i'm able to now sew one with the other one so select free sewing tool and then i can just simply sew it while pressing shift and then in the 3d window i can check that the threads are okay and i can simulate now we are going to go with the fabric we have these two fabrics by default so let's go to the library and choose the ones we want so in my case i have a lycra for the shell and another one for the lining i'm going to add them both to the object browser by double clicking on them and now if i do right click on the 3d window background i can select hide show and hide all so i get to see the texture of the fabric and not the orange stretching color now i'm going to apply the shell fabric the liquid one to the shell and then the liquid lining for the lining in here and then all the others i can just click in this icon to delete them okay now if i take a look i see my texture remember you can always edit the texture with the edit texture tool in both windows so i can scale it i can rotate it and i can move my texture if i select my fabric and go to the texture tab under the property editor i see the image for my texture now let's imagine i need to have a print on my bikini in my case i have this image here that i would like to combine with the image of the texture so next to the texture tab i have an option called open texture editor we get a message saying that the image is going to be saturated but only in this window so as you see now is blue or green now i can select add in here to add my image so i can look for it in my computer say open okay now i need to use the gizmo on the corner to adjust it to the window so in this case i don't have a repetition it's just an image i can change the order of my images i can put the print under the main texture on or on top and i can change the blend mode for example multiply or normal or average you have many options and also for the main texture now i'm going to select desaturation so i can properly see the colors of my print and then once you have it you can select apply and close now my texture is desaturated so i can activate the color so i see the colors of the print but not the blue color of the main texture because it was desaturated in the texture editor now i can again work with my edit texture tool in the 3d window to relocate um the print as i like and for instance for the lightning i would like a flat color so i select the fabric go to the color tab and i am going to apply one of this i have here okay now let's move on um another thing we can do is we can add some top stitching in here in the object browser we have for now a default top stitch the first thing i can do is i can customize it by changing the name and then in the property editor i can continue changing for example the offset the stitch count the shape the length and also the thickness for example i'm going to write 100 and then also i can change the color in the color tab and now with the free top stitch tool l we can do some top stitching if i take a look inside i don't see it because i need to customize this as well so if i go down and reach the configuration i can change the face to the back and then i will see it in the inside of the fabric now i can continue doing the top stitching on the top in my case i'm doing it in the lining but you could also do it in but you could also do it in the shell of course and for example in the ribbon as well if you'd like now if we take a side view of the avatar we see this is not straight the front part is not aligned with the back and with the ribbon if this happens to you you can use a basic tape measure avatar to create a tape on the back of the avatar we use it by doing one click to start we have some guides and then i'm going to do different clicks click here here and then a double click to end and then it goes yellow and this means i can use it by selecting attach to measure avatar i do one click on the pattern outline and then one click on the basic tape and this means it's going to be attached now i need to select the ribbon and i need to deactivate the pattern and the sewing this way when we simulate the fabric is going to reach the basic tape we made but the ribbon is not going to move now we can activate the ribbon again and relocate it with the gizmo and then simulate again right now the shell fabric is stretching i can show strafing and we see how the shell is stretching and going to simulate and then we can unstress strengthen so we see really how the bikini fits now that it's properly simulated and everything is stable um we can also add some puckering so i'm going to select the free puckering tool and then in the object browser we have a default puckering we can change the material from cotton to nylon for example and then we can customize it and start applying some pockering we can take a closer view right now it looks like this but then we can continue customizing it by changing for instance the density and the width until we obtain a result that we like something like this for me for example now we can low down the particular distance of the bikini and simulate again to get a final result and here we go we have our bikini done in this second part we are going to build up a bathing suit from scratch and this means we are going to create the patterns directly in here for that we are using the 3d pen avatar tool which you can find on the 3d window toolbar with this tool we can draw directly on the skin of the avatar and then obtain the patterns from it to start working with this tool we need to do one click and then we can do straight lines or curved lines we can do curved lines if we press ctrl and then if we stop pressing ctrl we can do straight lines again and we obtain each time we do a segment point we obtain the length of the line and then if we press shift we get these guide lines so we can make sure we are doing a straight line if i press ctrl again then i have my curved lines again and then to finish my drawing my shape i go back to the initial point for example here i have a first shape for a pattern so i change tools to flatten and then i go on top of the shape i do one click and enter and then i have a piece of pattern located in the 2d window and the 3d window on top of the avatar in the same place where i created it then i can relocate it and once i have it in the 2d window i can use the edit pattern tool to modify the shape of the pattern now i'm going to go back to the 3d pen avatar tool to continue drawing the bottom part of the bathing suit i'm going to start on the side and press again shift to do a straight line and reach the center of the avatar then i'm going to go down to the crotch i can shift and then i can press ctrl again to do a curved line and go again to the side and up to close my shape then again flatten tool one click to select the shape and then enter and then i have my new pattern now same as before we can move the pattern in the 2d window and modify it a bit for example in the center line i needed to be straight i need to modify this here and this and the fast way of changing a curved line into a straight line is adding a point somewhere in the middle and then you can do right click and delete the point then you'll have a straight line i'm going to do the same in here so add point split line and then i delete it and now i have my straight line now i can continue modifying my pattern with edit curvature to change a bit this shape here and now i think it looks okay so what i can do is select the patterns right click and symmetric pattern with sewing now that i have my new patterns placed in the 2d window i'm going to use the gizmo in the 3d window to move them closer to the avatar now we would need to merge the center front of the pattern so we have only one piece in the end okay and now we can go with the back i'm going to select again this pattern piece and make a copy of it so copy and paste and then i can get the back pattern from the front by just modifying the shape a bit later on i'm using the gizmo to arrange it a bit okay in between these two patterns we need to give it more length because i wasn't able to draw on the avatar with my 3d pen in here so i'm just adding two centimeters to the crotch in each side now i need also for these two strips to reach the back of the neck where we will have a knot with a bow so i am also modifying the patterns to change the length um in this case by five centimeters we now have all the patterns correctly placed around the avatar and we can start sewing i'm starting with segment sewing for the back of the neck then for the center front and now i need to change to free sewing because i am missing one segment point in here but obviously this will depends on your own design but just to remind you with resewing you don't need to have two specific segments with the same length to see one another and then i can finish with segment sewing again for the sides now i still need a strip for the back to also have a knot and a bow so to create this pattern i need to know the total length for the back so i'm selecting basic tape measure avatar to start measuring with one click then i'm going to click through all the back and then double click when you're finished so you can know the total length in the 3d window i select rectangle tool and one click on the background to get this input window where we can write the measurements for our strip then this pattern we can also sew it to the front pattern with the free sewing first to one side only then in the 3d window we do superimpose side and then we can sew it to the other side like this okay now let's try to simulate a first time and see how it goes for a better and more stable result we can use stretching on our patterns so the fabric gets more uptight more intense and okay looks good now is when i am modifying a bit the shape of the back pattern i got from the front one um i am using smooth curve to give it more width but again this will depend on your design maybe you want a brazilian shape or a culotte i don't know and now if we hide um the garment in the toggle bar in the 3d window we still see the 3d drawing reference on the avatar so we can choose edit 3d pen avatar to select all the drawing lines while pressing shift and then when we have them all we can do right click on top of the selection and delete and then we don't see them anymore and we can reactivate the view of the garment again we can hide the stretching orange color by right clicking on the background on the 3d window and selecting show hide color and then hide all for the bathing suit as for the bikini we need to have a lining for that we select all the patterns we do right click and select layer clone under we place it and now we can simulate to see how it is stable and we have now two layers of fabric okay now let's add the ribbons we go to library then hardware and trims and inside we have a folder named ribbon this is a default folder and inside we have some trims but in this case we want the ribbons as a c pack so as a garment because we want the fabric to drape naturally during the simulation you can choose the one you like so right click and add workspace then ok once you have it in your 2d and 3d window you can click on this diana here which will allow you to relocate to the garment so the ribbon wherever you want then you can continue adjusting the position by using the gizmo once you leave it close to the center back you can leave space so you can check the sewing in the 3d window and we can also reorganize the patterns in the 3d window here now we can start sewing but before that we need two internal lines where we want the ribbon to be sewn to the strips so internal polygon line and i draw two internal lines one and two now free sewing tool and i can sew it to the center back of the neck and you can make sure in the 3d window the threads are correct and you don't need to reverse them and then we can simulate and see how it falls okay i'm going to add another one for the back here for the second ribbon i am doing the same and i also need two internal lines for the sewing but in this case i also need one internal line in the center back so i select at point split line and then a uniform split to create a point exactly in the center then polygon internal line and i can draw the line and now i can use free sewing tool while pressing shift to sew the ribbon to the back of the basting shirt again we check the sewing and then simulate okay so now we have all the pieces of our bathing suit done we have all the ribbons and all the patterns and the lining and we could go now work with the fabric right now i only have in my object browser the default fabrics so i'm going to open the library and i'm going to add two new fabrics i have one for the shell and one for the lining now i'm going to select in the 2d window all the patterns for the shelf fabric and all the patterns for the lining and then i'm deleting the rest remember you can always modify the texture on your fabric with edit texture 3d or 2d and you can also add another texture on top if you go to the texture tab in the property editor of the fabric we get the message that the fabric is going to be shown with the color texture okay then to add one image on top we select add we select the image mines here and now here i have it i need to scale it in my texture editor window with the help of this gizmo on the corner in my case my image is not a repeat but maybe yours is i have to make sure that my other texture is desaturated and if i want it to be then you can select between the different types of blend we saw before already with the bikini and then i am choosing multiply once i like it i press apply and close now as i had it desaturated i can deactivate the option because i already desaturated the base texture as i said my print is not a repeat so i'm adjusting my texture with edit texture tool if you have one texture or print for the lining you can do the same for that fabric in my case i'm just applying a color in the color window now for the top stitch is the same right now we have a default top stitch so we can modify it i saved the one before we used with the bikini so i'm opening it in the proper editor and using it on the bathing suit now i've selected a segment top stitch tool to apply top stitching on the top part on the bottom and then on the back you can also use free top stitch tool if you have some segment points or notches and then let's take a look i'm going to add two more on the sides and that's it for the top stitching okay well now our bathing suit is done um if we select the patterns we see in the proper theater the particular distance is at 20. so we can load that down for the ribbons the particular distance is 3 already by default but for the rest of the patterns we did is 20 so we can change that to 5 and simulate again so we have a better fitting another thing we can do is that we see here um especially that the patterns look thin so we can change the add thickness rendering in the propagator so we give the fabric more thickness visually so it looks more realistic okay and i think this would be it we have the bathing suit done and now we could do the renders of it i hope you liked this tutorial and that it helped you and see you in the next one you ",
        "Summary": "# Comprehensive Guide to Constructing a Classic String Bikini and Bathing Suit This guide provides a step-by-step breakdown of constructing a classic string bikini and bathing suit using 3D design software. It will cover all necessary instructions, definitions, tips, and tricks mentioned in the tutorial transcript. ## Part 1: Constructing a Classic String Bikini ### Step 1: Set Up Your Workspace 1. **Open Library**: Go to your library and find the patterns folder. 2. **Import Patterns**: Locate the `.dxf` file for your bikini patterns. Right-click and select \"Add to Workspace.\" ### Step 2: Modify Patterns 1. **Edit Half Patterns**: If you have half patterns, use the **Edit Pattern Tool**. 2. **Unfold Patterns**: Right-click on the middle line of the pattern and select \"Unfold Symmetric Editing with Sewing.\" 3. **Apply Symmetry**: Select the symmetric patterns and right-click to apply \"Symmetric Pattern with Sewing.\" ### Step 3: Add Avatar 1. **Select Avatar**: Navigate to the avatar folder and choose a female avatar (e.g., Camilla). 2. **Change Texture**: In the texture folder, locate an image without underwear, drag it to the avatar's chest in the property editor to change the texture. ### Step 4: Position Patterns 1. **Move Patterns**: Select all patterns and use the gizmo to move them above the avatar for clarity. 2. **Arrange Around Avatar**: Use arrangement points to position all patterns correctly around the avatar. ### Step 5: Sewing 1. **Sew Crotch Piece**: Use the **Free Sewing Tool** to attach the crotch piece to both the front and back pieces. 2. **Sewing Sides**: Use the **Segment Sewing Tool** to sew the sides of the bikini bottom and the top strips. 3. **Cross Front Top**: For the top, position the patterns so they cross and sew appropriately. ### Step 6: Simulate Fit 1. **Simulate**: Check the simulation to ensure the bikini fits well. 2. **Adjust Avatar's Pose**: Activate \"Show X-Ray\" to see joints. Adjust the avatar's legs as needed and simulate again to achieve a better fit. ### Step 7: Add Lining 1. **Create Lining**: Right-click on the patterns and select \"Layer Clone Under\" to create lining patterns placed under the shell patterns. ### Step 8: Add Ribbons 1. **Select Ribbons**: Go to the library, select the hardware and trims folder, and find the ribbon you want. 2. **Relocate Ribbons**: Use the target feature to position the ribbons on the 3D model. 3. **Draw Internal Lines**: Use the **Polygon Internal Line Tool** to create internal lines on the patterns where the ribbons will be sewn. ### Step 9: Apply Fabrics 1. **Choose Fabrics**: Select lycra for the shell and another fabric for the lining from the library. 2. **Apply Textures**: Drag the chosen fabrics onto the respective patterns in the 2D window. ### Step 10: Edit Texture 1. **Open Texture Editor**: Add desired images for prints and adjust their positioning and blending modes. 2. **Desaturation**: Desaturate the main texture to allow the print to show through. ### Step 11: Add Top Stitching 1. **Customize Top Stitch**: Adjust the properties of the default top stitch in the property editor. 2. **Apply Top Stitching**: Use the **Free Top Stitch Tool** to add stitching to the necessary areas. ### Step 12: Final Adjustments 1. **Adjust Puckering**: Select the **Free Puckering Tool** to apply puckering to the bikini. 2. **Simulate Again**: Check the final simulation to ensure everything fits well. ## Part 2: Constructing the Bathing Suit ### Step 1: Draw Patterns with 3D Pen Avatar Tool 1. **Select Tool**: Use the **3D Pen Avatar Tool** to draw directly on the avatar's skin. 2. **Create Shapes**: Click to create straight or curved lines while holding **Ctrl** for curves and **Shift** for straight lines. ### Step 2: Flatten and Modify 1. **Flatten Shape**: Use the **Flatten Tool** to convert your drawn shape into a pattern in the 2D window. 2. **Edit Patterns**: Adjust the shape using the **Edit Pattern Tool** to refine the design. ### Step 3: Symmetric Patterns 1. **Apply Symmetry**: Right-click and select \"Symmetric Pattern with Sewing\" to create matching patterns. ### Step 4: Sewing 1. **Copy Patterns**: Copy the front pattern and modify it for the back. Ensure the patterns are correctly placed. 2. **Sew Together**: Use segment and free sewing tools for various parts of the bathing suit. ### Step 5: Internal Measurements 1. **Measure Lengths**: Use the **Basic Tape Measure Avatar** to measure lengths for the back strips. 2. **Create Strips**: Use the rectangle tool to create strips based on your measurements. ### Step 6: Add Ribbons 1. **Add Ribbons**: Select ribbons from the library, adjust their positions, and sew them to the bathing suit. ### Step 7: Apply Fabrics and Textures 1. **Select Fabrics**: Choose fabrics for the shell and lining, applying them to the respective patterns. 2. **Edit Textures**: Use the texture editor to add prints or adjust the appearance of your fabrics. ### Step 8: Finalize with Top Stitching 1. **Add Top Stitching**: Use the segment or free top stitch tool to add top stitching to the bathing suit. ### Step 9: Adjust Rendering 1. **Thickness Rendering**: Adjust the thickness rendering in the property editor for a more realistic look. ### Tips and Tricks - **Simulate Often**: Regularly simulate your designs to catch fitting issues early. - **Use X-Ray**: Activating the X-ray mode is crucial for making adjustments that involve the avatar's joints. - **Layer Management**: Keep your layers organized in the object browser to improve workflow. - **Custom Textures**: Experiment with different blending modes in the texture editor for unique designs. - **Save Progress**: Regularly save your work to avoid losing progress. ## Conclusion By following these comprehensive steps, you can create both a string bikini and bathing suit using 3D design software. Experiment with different fabrics, textures, and sewing techniques to personalize your designs. Happy designing!"

        "Transcript": "hi my name is phoebe and i am our ux designer working with all of our global teams here at khloe i will be walking you through these new features that we've developed for our 7.0 release and we are all very proud and excited to show you this if you have any questions please feel free to write them in in the chat and somebody will be answering them live with you all so let's dive right in and get started one key update for khloe is the improvements made for mac equipment so now users will be able to see a vast improvement on working with inklow on mac m1 silicone chips so we've worked really hard on making sure that it's faster and easier to work on these computers now and we will continue to study and optimize this so please look forward to future improvements but for now i hope you're really happy with what we've done and that you're able to use khloe quickly and easily as always enclose clothes 7.0 we have linked pantone into khloe to make sure khloe has the most updated pantone colors possible win-win right so you'll be able to access this pantone library with any closed software so by going into the color window you'll be able to get into here you can get to the color window by all of our different ways the fabric selecting a trim selecting an avatar anyway and then you just go into your property editor and select that color chip color window will then open and what you'll see is a new tab the pantone color tab now please note the information icon this just explains that these colors may not match the pantone identified standards uh here though you'll see that there's also a drop down menu and this will show you the three different color options the polyester cotton and nylon option which were the original one two and three tabs in previous versions of club you'll still have all the same viewing options as you did before this color chip option of viewing your pantone colors and then if i go down to the um viewing icon right below here i can then switch to the list option and if i select that again the detailed option another feature that we still have is the ability to change like zoom in and zoom out on how big you want your view to be and how small you want it to be and we've also kept the same way in which you can search for pantone colors by either typing in the number like so which is really great or you could do my personal favorite which is you can look up similar colors so if i go over to this green color right here i can then look it up for similar colors and i'll see all of these similar green pantones it's my favorite way now once you find the color you like and you've picked it out within this color window it will work as always you'll select the color and then you'll see it change in your 3d window in real time and that's it in close 7.0 we are introducing the parametric pattern feature users now have the ability to create a first draft without needing any pattern drafting knowledge this feature is located in the editor tab at the top of the toolbar once selected you can then choose parametric pattern parametric pattern will then appear on the screen and here is where you can easily input your measurements to create a pattern you will have a few different options for your pattern for the front and back pattern pieces you can choose between symmetry half symmetry or no symmetry at all symmetry option will apply symmetry to all pattern pieces that are linked but they're all be um separate half symmetry will create unfolded symmetrical patterns so it will be um two pattern pieces a front and then a back and then finally if you don't check anything you will then just create two half pattern pieces a half front and a half back with no symmetry applied if you would like to add sleeves to your body simply check the on box next to the sleeves and you'll then create some sleeves if you want a symmetrical copy just check on the symmetrical box pretty easy uh you can see that there will be measurements inputted when you first open up clo for the parametric pattern window if you ever want to reset to those measurements just hit the reset button at the bottom left here now let's start to input some measurements you can reference a multitude of things to create your first draft but i'm going to use an old spec page before i start to type in the front measurements here is an image of where all of these measurements are taken in relationship to a pattern or garment for the front body so now i'm just going to quickly and easily put in all of my measurements now um one important thing to note is there is a total option so it's next to some measurements if you check this total option on you are choosing to import the total circumference of the pattern this will include the measurement of both the front and the back pattern meaning the correlating back measurement will then be deactivated as you can see now um the back measurement is all out and great so now i'll just put in the rest and now that my front is done i'll move on to the back and here's an image of all of the measurements that are taken in relationship to the pattern garment for the back measurements now i'll just input all of my back measurements really quickly and easily now that my back measurements are done i want to check on my sleeve so i'll check on for my sleeves and here also is an image of all of the sleeve measurements for you to see and once i'm done typing those in i'll just hit create that bottom button and i'll have created some patterns um in a matter of moments right and it's really great we're really proud of this feature if you have any input we're always welcome to it this feature will continue to be improved and worked on but we're always open to suggestions we have made some updates to our grading tools to increase the ease of use within these tools when using the edit each grading tool if you select a point with multiple sizes stacked on top or close to one another a drop down will appear allowing you to choose the size you wish to edit once you've chosen the size you wish to edit you can then either use your arrows on your keyboard or your mouse to start to move and adjust that size what's also really nice is now we've included some guides for you to use so holding down shift you can get that x y horizontal and vertical 45 degrees guides and of course if you're holding down control then you will see the extension of your pattern outlines and those like curves and angles that they're going we also did include the precision box for you all so now you can be super precise all the time uh just right clicking and you'll get the precision box while moving your points and you can type in any number you wish to adjust your measurement pretty great we have now included an option when importing a dxf to rotate the grain line back to zero so here when i open up my dxf you'll see the reset rain line option and there are three choices so there's maintain original 270 to 0 and 90 to 0. maintain original simply means to keep the original green line direction so i'm gonna select maintain original and you see here that it stayed at 270. so the value state that's where a lot of the issues were starting to occur so now i'm going to use this new feature and i'm going to say convert from 270 to 0. now my value in my property editor is at 0. you will notice though that the grain line on the pattern hasn't moved just the value within the property editor has the same results will be true if i decide to use the 90 to 0 for a pattern that had originally a 90 grain line and also when using maintain original and i just had a zero grain line this improvement we hope will solve the issue that was occurring when users were bringing in dxf patterns that were made horizontally in other cad softwares and the value would be incorrect so we hope this solves that problem if not give us some feedback another improvement we've made with green lines is now you're able to actually rotate your pattern along the grain line nice right just simply select your pattern using your transform tool right click and you can now rotate your pattern and you can um reset a long grain line now we'll go back to its original orientation and you can now quickly and easily continue to edit you are now able to export a rule file within khloe here i have finished grading this t-shirt and i would like to export the rule file that i've created here so i'm going to just go to file export dxf and then here i'll save out the name and then i'll get that great little pop-up box for dxfs here i'll have three different types of dxf formats to choose from and i'll also have to choose between a graded nest or a rule file there's also the scale options that i can choose as well i can then select ok and save out my dxf and rule file separately now this is the amazing part i can go into a new project that doesn't have any grading and i can add in this rule file quickly and easily and i've just graded this and it's all done you now have the ability to import csv files into your pom tab so you're now able to add in these csv files to quickly name poms and also add in plms within club you can do this really easily so here i've put in um some poms already that i've just like drawn in using my pom tool and now i'm just going to go to this file open icon and bring in a csv file of all of these properly named poms once that's been populated i now can take these measurements that i've already done in clo and i can actually download them into the correct names so i can download my center front here and i can also put in that center back what's also really nice is i can just click on these poms as well and put them in manually too so i can just use my vom tool and put this in right away really quickly and easily i also can just add points of measure still i don't need to use what i've put into co right now i can just put some in and i can still download that into the csv ones that i just inputted you also can delete any blank ones that you may not want but you have a lot of options here now and this is a really great and fun feature to use that will definitely help speed up time now when using the add point split line tool you will see that there are smart guides so you can go to your ad point slit line tool and hover anywhere on your pattern and then you'll start to see these little guides to help you place them in a more accurate way within your 2d pattern there have been some improvements to the flattening tool within 7.0 previously this tool was trying to extract shape out of the avatar by treating it as a cloth simulation this was actually causing a lot of calculation time and some unexpected bugs so now we've implemented a new algorithm allowing shorter calculation times and more stability this in turns allows the user to create more accurate patterns within complex shapes as you can see here uh also as you can see i can create much smaller and complex patterns more efficiently and after flattening these pieces my patterns are created faster with more stability than before you will now be able to see the outline of the buttons within schematic render window you can go into your schematic render window in your 3d toggle menu and you can see the buttons are now highlighted great right you can play around with the thickness of their line through the seam line and of course you can change the color of this line all the things we already know what you might not know though is you can also now add the thread line within the schematic printer first i'll go to my object browser select my button and then go into my property editor and then i'll click on the thread tab here i'll uncheck same as front and i'll change the color to black and that's how you can add in the line for some added render you can now move both the avatar and garment together in your 3d space most excited in the 3d window you can now just select your avatar right click select avatar and garment and now using that gizmo tool you can move your avatar and garment together anywhere within the 3d window pretty snazzy users now have the option to adjust their 3d background image by right-clicking anywhere in the 3d window you will see the option format 3d background selecting the icon image here to open you can bring in your image now over next to that open icon image is the lock ratio if you want to lock the ratio you'll just select that if you want to keep it unlocked your keep it unlocked when you lock the ratio it will maintain the original images ratio this will then allow you to easily zoom in and adjust and move your avatar around onto that 3d background image and place it where you'd like it to be there have been a few improvements within the colorway mode the first one being the placement of colorway mode now when going into the mode section of khloe you will see that colorway and bom are no longer there they're still there though they're just over in the editor tab at the top toolbar when you select the editor you'll then see bom colorway and parametric pattern a really nice feature that arose from this update is the ability to seamlessly move between your 2d window and your colorway window fairly easily so now you can edit your pattern and then switch to your colorway window to see the updates another great update is the ability to see all your texture maps when selecting the icons within the colorway mode so now when you click on your icons here in your colorway mode you'll see in your property editor that all of the maps are there to edit and adjust now you can quickly and easily edit your colors graphics anything without having to go into the object browser like before speeding up your workflow a bit another great update is making it easier to delete graphics trims and other objects within the colorway window to delete any of these items all you have to do is right click on them and select the delete icon if they are in use in other color ways a pop-up will come up warning you of this please keep in mind that this will delete the object from all colorways not just that one drag and drop has been another improvement to our user's workflow so now you can just drag and drop fabrics into your colorway editor and that will change the texture and maps of that icon of that fabric just so you know this new feature only changes the appearance of the fabric meaning all the maps will be adjusted however it does not change the physical drape or properties of the colorway not yet at least a viewing improvement we have made to our colorway mode is the ability to now hide or show graphics so there's this option here to hide or show graphics scrolling down you'll see that i not can view all of the graphics that are within every colorway in each colorway however i can check hide or show graphics on and then i'll only see the graphics that i'm using for that one colorway pretty nice and organized i'd say you can choose whether you'd like to see every graphic or if you just want to see the graphics you're using now in that colorway another viewing update is the change from list to list view to viewer view now it's just show details or not as you can see at the bottom right hand corner if i unselect this i will just see the images instead of the details and i can then just go into save image still and i have the either colorway view or snapshot and what's really nice is now that name is going to automatically populate so i don't have to type it all in and if that's not a win i don't know what is and then you can just hit ok and this will be the same for snapshot and the colorway editor you now have the option to show or hide your grading within print layout mode in the 2d pattern display icon at the top left you can turn show grading on or off and see your grading now in version 7.0 you can also see nesting results in real time after clicking nest patterns the system will start to calculate the consumption and everything for your pattern layout and you'll see this changing and updating in real time as the calculation goes on the results are if the results are almost unchanged you can actually stop then the nesting early or you can let it continue to go we have made some improvements to our bom first off again the bom is no longer in the mode section but if you go over to editor in the top toolbar you'll find it there and it'll be great you'll also now be able to seamlessly switch between blm mode and your 2d window which is kind of great another great update we've done for our bom mode is there's a little icon next to the fabric an information icon what this is doing is it's giving you a little fun fact that the print layout is linked to your bom so if you update your print layout to the most efficient nesting option then the pricing will update as well one thing to note though about this is if you nest multiple sizes like i'm about to do then it will take into account that whole nest for all of the sizes it is not a sample price it is a more of a production price with all of the different sizes like so and now i can just update it and see the price change based off of the nesting our final mode improvement is with emulator mode so now we have updated it so that our stretch force tolerance will allow for .005 this difference is for very high stretch fabrics if you input a number that has a force difference of 0.005 there will be an information icon next to it this little information icon when hovered over will just state that this is counted as a very high stretch fabric um if the difference is above 0.005 then just that like a little tool icon will be next to it and if the difference is below 0.005 a little um warning icon will appear next to it just letting you know that this is below what it should be and maybe for you to check it out just always trying to be helpful we are happy to announce that in version 7.0 you will now be able to adjust your zipper teeth and tape separately so you can see here that there's a separate tab for teeth in a separate tab for tape now i can just go in and change these colors around and the maps lots of different things and adjust and edit them very independently of one another along with changing out the colors you can also change out the maps so here i can go over and bring in different teeth and tape textures within my property editor to change the appearance all of these texture images are actually in the hardware and trims folder under zipper that you can use there are a few different types of textures that you can use that khloe provides there is plastic metal and nylon please note though that if you edit a zipper from a previous file you're going to then have to actually bring in one of these texture maps to either the tape or the teeth so that you can then adjust them separately if not what you adjust won't show up another great thing is you can adjust the presets of both the tape and teeth separately so here if i see type i can underneath that type drop down menu right here i can select different types for the tape and different types for the teeth and continue to play and adjust and create all these different zipper tape and teeth presets and creations we have made a few updates to our binding tools the first update is the ability to now have binding on both sides of the fabric really fun so here we will apply the binding as normal and as you can see adding in the binding is much smoother and easier as we've been before make sure to simulate after you add in the binding to stabilize that i'll then select the binding and i'll go into type and when i drop down you'll see that there is a new option called both this will then allow you to add your binding to both the back and front or under and over i'll then of course want to simulate again to update this and make sure that my garmin is stable and now i'll have binding on both my under and over another update is applying binding to seam lines also really exciting so now in khloe you will be able to apply binding to edges even if they are sewn i'll apply the binding to this shoulder seam here once applied clove will then prompt me to decide which side i want to apply this binding to i will then just select the side that i want and then i'll just continue as usual as usual there so all of the rest of the binding properties and adjustments will remain exactly the same we have made a small update to our top stitches within close 7.0 you are now able to change the order of top stitches by going into your edit top stitch tool and then selecting your top stitch that you want right clicking and then going into order you'll then have a few options you'll have bring forward bring to front send backwards and send it back whichever one you select you'll then see appear within your 2d window for your top stitches we have made some exciting updates to our trims this release one is being able to convert patterns to trims this will be very helpful for decorative trims and all different types of hardware here i created a butterfly with enclose and would like to convert it to a trim first i will make sure my trim is mapped using unified so that my textures are what i want them to be i'll then right click in my 3d window and select convert to trim clicking on that the pattern will then convert to a trim and disappear in your 2d window i'll then be able to place it onto my garment exactly as i would if i was using any other trim please know that your trims weight does get recalculated so you may have to check that another update within the trims in 7.0 is the ability to now duplicate your trends to a symmetric pattern and mirror paste i'll do this here so i will select this slider right click and duplicate it to symmetric pattern as you can see this has made it infinitely easier to bring this trim to my symmetric pattern you can also now mirror paste your trims within your 3d window so here i'll select my butterfly right click copy it and then i'll just right click and select mirror pace the shadow of the trim will show up allowing me to decide exactly where i'd like to place this then i'll click and place it wherever i like and start to move and adjust it in close 7.0 you can add buttons to internal lines again yay i'll first select my internal line using my transform tool then i will go into the add button tool over in my 3d toolbar right click on top of the internal line the pop-up box will appear and i'll be able to select how i'd like to distribute my buttons throughout these internal lines i'll then hit ok once i'm happy with what i've chosen and then you'll see it here in my 3d and 2d window all of my buttons on this internal line i can continue to edit and adjust these buttons using my property editor to exactly what i'd like them to look a very exciting improvement to close 7.0 is the color switch in our texture editor the color switch will allow you to edit individual colors within prints and graphics very exciting so here in this graphic i'll show you exactly how selecting the layer i'll check on color switch type in the amount of colors i'd like to switch i can then hover over these colors and you'll see it highlight and now i can select the color and in my color window i can change those colors out i can then select apply and close and that will then update in my colorway mode i can do the same thing for this next colorway on the exact same graphic i'll go into my multi-texture editor select the layer type in the amount of colors then hover over the color i'd like to switch select it and then with my color window i can change any point i want so i can adjust either graphic however i'd like to and it will only affect that one colorway still which is really great i can also do the exact same thing for print so here i can select my print fabric and i can go into my multi-texture editor check on color switch type in the amount of colors within that print select the colors and change them but i can also check on this blur box and this will allow for my colors to be a little bit sharper because it will give a like a larger blur to the edges so it'll look a little bit nicer within my print and now i can just go through and edit this and adjust it exactly as i want for this new colorway and it's really fun and easy to do as you can see i can then just hit again apply and close and update my colorways and see what i like and i can continue to do this and adjust each colorway as i see fit we have updated our layout and for our library we now have a tree structure so starting with clothes 7.0 our library will now have a tree structure within it where you can expand and collapse icons to open folders within this tree structure we believe that this structure will make navigation and organization a little bit easier within khloe and a little bit faster as you can see you can use these drop down tools to see all of the subfolders you have if there are no longer any more subfolders then this icon will no longer appear to drop down so pretty intelligent another improvement we've made is the object browser also now has a tree structure so look at that so over here in the scene tab for our object browser you'll also see a very similar layout now of a tree structure what you'll also see is icons describing what each major section is again these little drop down icons will appear when there are subfolders underneath or there's more sub information and you can continue to drop down or you can hide more and more information to allow you to see your object browser seen a little bit more clearly and easily this update is not only more user-friendly we believe but we also know that it will enable multiple features access in one concentrated area so we're happy about it another update we've made is adding solidify to the color options within our ui settings so now if i select solidify on this garment i can then go into my settings and go into my user interface settings and change this solidify color to any color i'd like as you can see when i select this pink it will update automatically into this we've also updated our um open garment options so now when you bring in a garment file you'll have this option to either maintain current avatars pose or use the garment files avatar pose if you select use the garment files the avatar pose will then change to what that garment file was and finally our another update is with our library image for our fabric so when i adjust and change this fabric around you'll see here that it also updates so when i'm using the texture editor and rotating and adjusting this fabric it will automatically rotate and adjust and update over in the object browser as well which is really nice so it'll always be accurate in 7.0 the fur maximum length has been updated so while previous versions uh you were able to increase the fur length to 254 millimeters now in this latest version you can increase it to a maximum of 1 000 millimeters for those of us who work in inches that's 40 inches so it's quite a lot before explaining how to do this i'm going to open up the render window to preview the fur immediately because the fur preset is only shown in the render window as we all may know so now i'm going to interactive and here you'll see the fur length all set and now i'll go into my property editor and change it to the maximum for length that is possible so here i will enter the maximum value of 1 000. you can see that the length of the fur has been increased through the interaction render as you may have already known the longer the fur length the more meshes you need to render so eventually the render time um will increase so please refer to that if you want to go to this extreme it will take you more time to render out we would like to introduce khloe to the discord channel the official clove server has been opened on

        "Title": "How to Create Neckbands & Neck Rib in CLO",
        "publishedAt": "2022-06-03T19:56:15Z",
        "Transcript": "hello everyone my name is jess and i'm going to show you how you can create a neckband or a neck rib for a t-shirt or a sweatshirt in club there are three different methods that we're going to go over in this video the first method is really great and quick and easy if you don't understand pattern making as much or if you just need a quick nice looking neckband for presentation purposes this is a really great route to go the second method is really similar to the first especially if you already know where you want your neckline to sit the third method is true to the way that a t-shirt is actually going to be constructed in real life so it's a rectangular piece that's actually going to be folded over so if you're looking to fit this style this would be a great method to follow when we get to the end i'll show you a little bit about how you can prep style and fix that neckband to sit nicely on your avatar alright let's jump in i have my file here and i already have a sweatshirt outfit and the neckline is ready to add a neck rib or uh neckband too there are a couple of different examples that we're going to go through and it may be situational which way which ones you decide to proceed with you may even use a combination of them for this first example we're going to add the neckband from where the original neckline is um so we'll be extending that material from where that is to start you can grab your edit pattern tool and i have symmetry at my front and my back you can tell because of the dash line going between going down the center front and the center back of these pieces so i only need to select one side of my neckline if you don't have symmetry you might need to select both sides with both of them selected i can now right click and the option i'm going to choose is offset pattern outline when i click to offset the pattern outline my direction is going to be it to extend because i'm extending the material from where the original outline is that i selected the distance is going to be whatever width of that neckband you would like it to be so i'm doing three quarters so i'm putting 0.75 inches into the distance the number of offsets i'm going to keep at 1 but if you would like to have additional offsets added at your neckline or any other time that you're using offset pattern outline you can always increase that amount i'm going to be sure to check off create internal line and that's because it's going to create an active internal line where my original pattern outline was we're going to use that to cut and sew this piece away for side segment type i'm going to change this to extend i'm changing this to extend because i want the material to just extend along the trajectory of the original shoulder seam where that's being added so everything is nice and smooth once i've done that i can press ok and you'll see that that additional material has been added into your neckline area we're actually going to cut and sew on that internal line where your original pattern outline was with the edit pattern tool so you can select half of your back neckline and half of your front neckline or your entire neckline where that originally was on the internal line and then you can right click and cut and sew that's going to cut that piece away something to keep in mind when you're using offset pattern outline is when you extend the material it's not going to sew that together for you at that side neck so we're actually going to need to go in i'm going to use my segment sewing tool and i'm going to sew the side neck together i'm only doing this on one side because it's maintained symmetry between each side of the front and the back neckline now the last thing here is to lower the particle distance of these two pieces so grab them with your transform pattern tool and then underneath simulation properties in the property editor you can lower the particle distance from 20 to 5. this is the best practice while you're working because these pieces are smaller or in height or width than your hand so while you're working it's a good idea to lower the particle distance of them now i can turn on my simulation and i have my neckband in place now i can go in and add a couple of details to this to make it look even more real i'm going to hide my avatar for a sec you can go into the vertical toggle menu and go to this option here to hide your avatar if you'd like to now right now it looks like just a single layer but i could make this look a little bit thicker using um kind of a visual trick and then clip you want to make sure you're on thick textured surface to see the effect of this it's in your vertical toggle menu and it's one of the surface views thick textured surface is going to show you the full thickness of all of your pattern pieces and we're going to add to that thickness you can then select the pieces your front and back neckband with your select move tool and your 3d window or your transform pattern tool in your 2d window whichever you would like we're going back into the property editor and we're going down to where it says additional thickness rendering additional thickness rendering is just a visual thickness that's being added to these pieces to give them just a little bit more thickness to them and so i'm going to increase that to about two and you can see already in my 3d window that that visually looks thicker almost like i've already put it unfold even though i haven't so it's a nice little trick you can try a couple of different additional rendering thicknesses until you're happy with the desired effect just about there looks good for me so i'm going to leave that there if this is meant to be double layer and a curved neckline like what you see here you could actually make it look that way as well on this edge so right now this edge just looks kind of curved as if the pieces unfold but i can actually turn on what's called double-sided to add a dent to that edge so that it actually looks double sided to do this you would go into grab your select move tool or your transform pattern tool and select that front neckband and then you're going underneath the selected lines section to where it says double-sided it's underneath curved side geometry and you'll see double-sided when you check this off all it's doing is adding a little dent here to this edge so that it looks like it's double-sided it's not making your pieces double-sided or anything like that but it can give you that effect so i've added out the front neckline and not the back and you can see that so that's the first option for creating a neckband and i'm just going to jump into a different file so i can show you another method and this method this is the original neckline and this is exactly where we want it to be so instead of extending the material we're going to cut into the body instead so you can grab your edit pattern tool i'm going to click on the front and the back neckline again and you're going to right click and offset as internal line when you get this offset as internal line box up the number of offsets is going to be one so however many internal lines that you want to create from your original pattern outline and then for the distance i'm going to put in that .75 that three-quarter inch neckband again so it's creating an internal line 0.75 away from the original pattern outline under option i'm going to be sure to check off extend i'm checking off extend because i want to make sure that the internal line is actually hitting the pattern edge so that i can cut all the way through once you've done that you can press ok if you want to make sure that you can see this in 3d window you can turn on being able to see your your internal lines by show internal lines and your vertical toggle menu now i'm going to grab my edit pattern tool and i'm going to select the internal line that i just created i'm selecting the front and back at the same time once they're selected i can right click and cut and sew to cut that piece away in this case the shoulder or the side neck is actually going to be sewn together for you because we used offset as internal line and cut away from where the original neckline is rather than extending the material but because we cut away from these larger pieces it is a good idea to lower your particle distance so you can select both of those pieces with the transform pattern tool and underneath simulation properties in the property editor you can go to particle distance and lower that from 20 to 5. it's a good idea to stimulate after you've changed particle distance and after you've made a new cutscene so go ahead and turn on your simulation for a sec you could use the options that i showed you in the last method to increase the thickness just visually or you could actually create a layer clone to give it that double-sided effect or that double layer effect so i'm going to grab my transform pattern tool i selected my front and my back neckband and just moved them up in the space to make it a little bit easier for me to add an additional layer then with the transform pattern tool i'll select both of the front and the back neckline or neckband and then i will go to layer clone under when you click layer clone under you're going to have the layer clone kind of attached to your mouse and you just need to put it down somewhere by left clicking once in your 2d window if i'm creating a layer clone under i tend to put it underneath the pieces that i am creating the layer cone from so a lot click wants to just put that down this very quickly and easily just makes a layer clone for you that second layer and it's already nicely in place you can turn on your simulation and you'll have two layers at your neckband and they'll already be sewn together for you which is really nice layer clones will automatically be stitched together on the pattern outline as well as any internal lines that could be there they'll also be linked if you make any changes in this next example we'll be creating a rectangular binding so it's going to be much closer to how an actual pattern would be um for this type of neckband on a t-shirt or even a sweatshirt especially if it's made of rib to start this we need to make sure that we understand how long our neckline is the neckline circumference so i'll grab my edit pattern tool i'll select half of the front neckline and then i will select half of the back neckline you might have to select your entire neckline if you don't have symmetry on your pieces on my cursor it's already going to show me what the length is of the segments that i've selected but if i look in my property editor i can see under selected line the 2d line length which is the lines that i've selected as well as the symmetric line length the symmetric line length is all of these segments that i've selected plus their symmetric copy that's about 21.68 and when you're making a rectangular binding it tends to be half inch to three quarters of an inch shorter than the original length of your neckline sometimes even one inch shorter so i'm going to round up this 21.68 to 21.75 and then reduce it three quarters of an inch so my neck band is going to be 21 inches wide then i'm going to grab my rectangle tool and to use the rectangle tool you just need to click once in your 2d window this will let you enter specific measurements so i'm going to enter that width of 21 and then for the height i'm going to fold this over so i'm going to put the entire height of what all of the material is going to be needed for it to be folded over you could also just put your finish length if you want to i'm going to do 1.5 so it ends up being 0.75 inches wide then i'm going to press ok to set myself up for success i'm going to go in and add the fold line on this piece i'll grab my edit pattern tool select the top segment hold shift select the bottom segment then i can right click and distribute an internal line between these segments for the number of offsets i'm only going to do one and that's really all you need to worry about in this box because it's going to distribute one internal line right down the center and then you can press ok i also like to right click and edit and extend trim and add point to pattern outline with the edit pattern tool because that'll break my pattern edge into two separate segments lastly before we sew this into place you don't want to forget to lower the particle distance because this piece is on the smaller side so grab your transform pattern tool click on that neckband and then underneath simulation properties you can lower your particle distance from 20 to 5 which is just a best practice while you're working this piece is ready to sew into place and i'm just going to hide my avatar you can go into your vertical toggle menu in your 3d window just so you can see exactly where you're sewing and make sure you're going in the same direction all the way around we're going to need to place our opening somewhere of this neckband and usually it's kind of a little bit back from the shoulder seam on either side of the neckline and that's just so that you can't really see that opening from the front i've already gone in and added a point where i want that to end and if you haven't you can go in and right click split and add that point wherever you would like to once your point is there and you understand where you want that opening to be you can sew it into place i like to set it up so i can see my 3d window at the same time while i'm sewing i'll grab my free sewing tool and we're going to do one to multiple sewing so sew your entire one segment click click along the neckband and then you'll hold shift telling chloe i've sewn one and now i'm sewing to multiples i'm going to start where that point is where the opening will be and i'll click once and then move along i'm gonna keep holding shift and i know i need to go in the same direction all the way around just sew this appropriately into place so if i'm ever confused i can move my mouse while still holding shift in my 3d window and just see where on my piece and what direction i'm supposed to be sewing in as i move my mouse you can see in my 2d window exactly where that is so i'll click once and then keep going around the neckline if i'm confused at all on where to jump onto that back piece again i can move my mouse into my 3d window and see where i'm supposed to be starting click and then click until you've finished all the way around your neckline i'll bring my avatar back so you can see what this looks like now with my select move tool in the 3d window i can right click onto this piece and rather than relying on simulation to get this piece into place i'm going to go to superimposed side superimposed side is just going to jump this piece into place and then it's a good idea to turn on simulation for a second just allow that piece to relax you will still need to make sure that you are sewing this shut at the opening of the neckband so you can grab your segment sewing tool and click click and click click i have two separate sections like you saw and then turn on your simulation to sew that shut now if you are just stopping there that's fine otherwise you can fold this over to fold this over you would grab your fold arrangement tool i have my internal lines showing so i can see the internal fold line that i created on my piece and that's easy for me to select i'll click once onto that internal line and then i'm going to grab whichever area is appropriate to fold the material over that i want to fold i'll left click and drag that all the way around and i want to just make sure i'm not going too far where you start to see you see that back of the fabric is starting to poke through you don't need to make those arrows match in fact you shouldn't if it's going to cause collision issues like what you see here you'll need to fold it as far as it needs to go because you can always go back in and adjust that later once that material is folded you can grab your segment sewing tool or your free sewing tool and stitch the top edge to the bottom edge of that neckband so you're basically seaming what you've folded over shut directly after you've created that sewing relationship or reselect it with the edit sewing tool you can go into the property editor and change the sewing line type of that sewing relationship from custom angle which would be a pressed open seam to turn this material is being folded back on itself so it doesn't actually need to be pressed open where you're sewing it together now you can turn on your simulation and see how your neckband is laying now generally when you're constructing this type of neckband on a t-shirt or even a sweatshirt it's usually steamed into place or kind of shaped into the neckline itself and you can do a couple of different techniques in clothes you kind of replicate that process or make it look like it's laying a little bit flatter so let me show you a couple of different ways that you can do this the first to make it lay flatter is to actually adjust the angle of where you folded you can grab your edit pattern tool click onto that internal line where you fold it and underneath fold you'll see the full angle the fold angle could be a variety of different angles depending on how far you folded that material you could bring that all the way down to zero and even turn on fold rendering which will make sure that you have a nice crisp clean edge there in addition to changing the angle of where you folded you can click onto that internal align and add a slight elastication to it in the property editor you'll go underneath selected line to where it says elastic and for the elastic ratio you could start with something like 95 an elastic ratio of 95 is going to shrink that line to 95 percent of the original length so once you've turned on at a ratio of 95 you can turn on your simulation and see how that lays you may want to go a little bit smaller depending on what your neckline looks like or your piece but that does a pretty good job of making sure that it's actually laying a little bit flatter keep in mind that you have an invisible barrier around your avatar as well as your pieces so if they look a little bit puffy or far away from the body there's a couple of things contributing to that here that can be lowered when you move into a higher resolution or when you're more finished with your style so the first trick is elastic i'm actually going to remove that elastic so i can show you another trick that you could use now you'll want to check the grain of your piece you can always switch to your edit texture tool to know which direction you want to apply shrinkage but you can grab your transform pattern tool click onto that piece and then underneath simulation properties another way to make this just sit and kind of shrink into your neckline a little bit is to change the shrinkage weft or warp you can try a couple of different ones when you turn on simulation it tends to shrink the neckline and look a little bit more steamed into place so up to you if that's something that you would like to try but definitely another option to get that neckband to sit just a little bit flatter and more steamed into your neckline another method and actually kind of follows a little bit of what you would do in real life when you would steam the neckline of a t-shirt into place you can use our steam tool to steam just the inner edge or the folded area of this to make it sit a little bit flatter when you have that steam brush tool you want to make sure that it's on kind of just a gentle shrinkage i have it on like negative nine percent right now the size is kind of small and then your hardness you can try a couple of different ones the hardness is whether it'll have kind of more of a hard edge in the way that you're brushing that steam into place or a softer a little bit more blurred edge to apply steam you'll just left click and drag i'm left clicking and dragging on the fold line so it's a little bit on the top and the bottom or the outer and the inner edge and then you can turn on simulation to see if that was enough steam for the look that you're going for you can always drag it again to apply a little bit more steam and then turn on your simulation and see if that is helping with how you'd like that to look now just to review a couple of factors that are contributing to the way that this neckland band is laying if you have it folded over you have a double layer keep in mind that if it looks puffy there is an invisible barrier around the entire piece which is propelling those two layers away from each other contributing to it looking not as flat as you might like it to look if you click on that piece with the select move tool underneath simulation properties that is the additional thickness collision generally you wouldn't lower this until you're very happy with how that piece is laying because if you allow those pieces to drape closer together by lowering this amount you have an increased risk of collision issues so i just lowered the additional collision thickness to 1.5 i can lower it to one and if you're watching my 3d window you can see how much flatter that is sitting if you can go down to 0.5 and see how flat that neckline is sitting so that's the first thing the next is that you can see there's a little bit of a distance between the avatar and the neckband if you click onto the avatar the avatar's version of that invisible barrier is called a skin offset right now that skin offset is three millimeters i'm going to lower that to 1.5 you can see the neckband is sitting a lot closer and now down to one and you can see that's sitting a lot closer generally you wouldn't do either of those things until you are very finished with your editing and the way that you want it to lay also if you use the high res button to move into high res the skin offset of the avatar as well as the additional thickness collision will both be lowered for you um while changing the particle distance or the resolution of all the pieces so it's not necessarily something you have to do manually more just if you're curious why your neckband isn't sitting the way that you want it to there is one more way and i'm going to switch into a different file to kind of steam your neckband into place and this one is a little bit more simulation based so in this example i already have my neckband in place it's already folded over and it's a rectangular neckband this specific rectangular neckband is really meant to be stretched into the neckline so it's quite a bit shorter and that's usually a good situation to use this technique it's already sewn into place but i'm going to in the 3d window right click on the piece and deactivate pattern and sewing deactivation is going to change the piece to this kind of purplish blue color and make it a little bit sheer so you can see that it is deactivated and chloe is basically going to pretend that the piece is not there in the space so when you turn on simulation it's going to give that neckline a chance to relax depending on the example you may see that neckline really open up because the neckband is not holding it into place once you've allowed that neckline to relax you can turn off simulation and we're actually going to freeze the front and the back pieces so select those pieces of the select move tool in the 3d window right click and freeze the reason we're freezing is because we're going to reactivate this piece so right click and activate and then we're going to turn on simulation to let the neckband now go to where the frozen neckline is so when i turn on my simulation my neckband is going to jump right to where that frozen neckline is essentially stretching the neckband into the frozen front and back now this is dependent on the physical property of the material how much it's going to kind of bounce back into place or if you have a really hard elastication there with the strong force on it but i'm going to right click and unfreeze the front and the back then i'll turn on my simulation again but the neckband should stay fairly stretched in depending on a couple of different factors to that neckline and lay nice and flatly flat for you all right i hope that this video was helpful you could even combine a couple of these different tactics to create different types of neckband effects or add different thickness you can even go in and make it even more realistic with different types of topstitch but i hope that it was helpful please let us know in the comments section if you have any questions about any of the methods that we just reviewed and don't forget to like and subscribe so that as you as we roll out more content you'll be able to see it as well thanks for watching and i hope you enjoyed you ",

        "Transcript": "hello everyone in this tutorial video i will demonstrate the difference between strengthen solidify and the bound functions these three functions have indeed similar effects however they should be used for different purposes and understanding them will give you more ease when creating your 3d so let's start by seeing the strengthen function in this example you can see that the body of the sweatshirt looks twisted and the fabric is not falling as it should whenever you have a similar situation you should use the strengthen function click with the right button of your mouse on the pattern either on the 2d or 3d window and then select strengthen the pattern piece will become orange indicating that strengthen function is on next turn on simulation when simulation is on the selected piece will become stiffer helping you to bring back the garment to its right place and right fall after achieving the desired result you can unstrengthen the garment by repeating the same steps or pressing the shortcuts ctrl h on your pc for a more natural look simulate again so the fabric will go back to its natural drape note that this function is made to be used temporarily if your need is to keep the garment stiff at all times then you might prefer using solidify or bond as we are going to see next let's have a look at solidify differently from strengthen the solidify function does not promote any visual alteration to the piece it actually works by holding the desired fold or drip of the garment in its place for example on this project i would like to keep the sweatshirt with rolled up sleeves therefore after achieving the desired drape i will solidify the sleeve so it will not lose its shape when simulation is on solidify enables you to keep the drape and still be able to move it let's see what happens if i to strengthen instead of solidifying when i strengthen the sleeve the fabric gets stiffer promoting alterations to the drape therefore the recommended function to keep a drape is solidify note that there are two ways of applying solidify either by clicking with the right button to the pattern piece and finding it on the pop-up window or by turning it on on property editor lastly let's see the bound function the bound function promotes the same effect as the interfacing so you should apply it for the same reasons that you would apply on a physical product such as giving more structure to small pieces like colors levels cuffs etc to apply this function select the piece and find bound in property editor turn it on by ticking the small box and choose the one that best suits your garment in preset a second way to apply bound in case you don't want to apply it over the whole pattern piece is by creating an internal shape select the internal line polygon tool and draw the shape where you'd like to apply it note that you must always start from the inside of the pattern and you must close the shape then select the created shape and turn on bond in property editor now you should have understood the difference between bound solidify and strengthen function thank you for watching ",
        "Summary": "# Comprehensive Guide to Strengthen, Solidify, and Bound Functions in 3D Garment Design In this guide, we will break down the differences between the **Strengthen**, **Solidify**, and **Bound** functions in 3D garment design, providing step-by-step instructions, definitions, tips, and tricks to effectively utilize these functions in your projects. ## Understanding the Functions ### 1. Strengthen Function - **Definition**: The Strengthen function temporarily stiffens a garment piece, allowing you to adjust its drape or position. - **Use Case**: Ideal for situations where fabric appears twisted or does not fall correctly. #### Step-by-Step Instructions 1. **Select the Pattern**: Right-click on the desired pattern piece in either the 2D or 3D window. 2. **Activate Strengthen**: Choose the \"Strengthen\" option from the context menu. The pattern piece will turn orange, indicating that the function is active. 3. **Turn On Simulation**: Activate the simulation to see the changes in real-time. The selected piece will become stiffer and return to a more natural position. 4. **Adjust as Needed**: If the desired effect is achieved, you can unstrengthen the garment by repeating the steps or pressing **Ctrl + H** on your PC. 5. **Re-simulate**: For a more natural look, simulate again to allow the fabric to drape naturally. #### Tips & Tricks - Use the Strengthen function only temporarily; it is not meant for permanent alterations. - Always check the garment in simulation to see how it reacts dynamically. --- ### 2. Solidify Function - **Definition**: The Solidify function holds the desired drape or fold of a garment in place without visual alteration. - **Use Case**: Best used when you want to maintain a specific shape, such as rolled-up sleeves. #### Step-by-Step Instructions 1. **Adjust the Drape**: First, achieve the desired drape or fold of the garment. 2. **Select the Pattern**: Right-click on the pattern piece you want to solidify. 3. **Activate Solidify**: Choose \"Solidify\" from the context menu or toggle it in the Property Editor. 4. **Simulate**: With solidify active, turn on simulation to see how the garment maintains its shape while still allowing for movement. #### Tips & Tricks - Solidify is the recommended function for maintaining drape without altering the garment's overall appearance. - You can use the Property Editor to access solidify quickly and efficiently. --- ### 3. Bound Function - **Definition**: The Bound function adds structure to small pieces, similar to interfacing in physical garments. - **Use Case**: Suitable for reinforcing areas like collars, cuffs, and hems. #### Step-by-Step Instructions 1. **Select the Piece**: Choose the pattern piece you want to apply the bound function to. 2. **Access Property Editor**: Open the Property Editor and look for the Bound option. 3. **Activate Bound**: Check the box to enable the Bound function and select the appropriate preset that suits your garment. 4. **(Optional) Create Internal Shape**: - Select the **Internal Line Polygon Tool**. - Draw the shape to apply bound, ensuring you start from the inside of the pattern and close the shape. - Select the created shape and enable Bound in the Property Editor. #### Tips & Tricks - Use Bound for small sections to give them extra structure without affecting the entire piece. - Experiment with different presets to find the best fit for your design. --- ## Summary By understanding the differences and specific applications of the Strengthen, Solidify, and Bound functions, you can enhance your 3D garment design process. Each function serves a unique purpose, and knowing when to use each will lead to better results in your designs. Thank you for following this guide, and happy designing!"

        "Transcript": "hi everyone in this video i'm going to make a shirt pattern following the basic block pattern that was created in the previous tips and tricks video you can find the direct link to the video below i will take the basic block pattern and make the shirt by modifying this pattern if you click more at the bottom of the video there is a link to the shirt specification and block pattern file feel free to download it and follow along in this video i will guide you on how to efficiently create patterns in clothes using a block pattern the creation of the shirt pattern has been divided into separate videos for the body placket and collar and also the sleeve and pocket for this video we'll be focusing on the body of the shirts so let's make a pattern if you have downloaded the file from the link unzip and load the project file into clove we can start by looking at this body spec on how to transform the block into a shirt pattern on the far left is the point of measure also known as the pom these are descriptions of each measurement point for the garment within the specification sheets the spec in the middle of the sheet is a specification of the current block pattern that we're going to start working on and on the right is the shirt spec which we'll be making in this video you can start by closing your library with a shortcut y as we won't be using it in this tutorial to start i will delete one half of the block as only half of the patterns will be used to manipulate the pattern to do this i will use the transform pattern tool shortcut a to select only the patterns on the right of the body then press delete on my keyboard i will also delete the notches and segment points on the block to prevent any inconvenience when editing first select the notch tool and drag a mark key box around all the pattern pieces and press delete on your keyboard then select the edit pattern tool shortcut zed and start selecting all the segment points that do not build up the pattern outline shape once you have all the necessary segment points selected right click on one of the selected points and press convert to curve point by doing this all the segment points will transform to curve points while still maintaining the pattern shape the reason we are changing the points this way is to prevent changes to the pattern shape as an example if i were just to delete all the points by selecting them and pressing delete you will see that all my curved lines turn to straight lines and ruin the pattern shape in this case converting to curve points is ideal another tip i would like to share with you is that you can create a shortcut for convert to curve points in fact you can do this of all your tools to do this you start by going to settings user settings shortcuts edit context menu 2d pattern and from here you can type in the shortcut for convert to curve points i will set it as control plus q once you are done you can press close at the bottom of the screen to show you how this works i will use the shortcut just hold down control q and drag over the segment points that you want to convert to curve points the segment points will be converted whilst maintaining the shape so if you use the keyboard shortcut like this you can work on your patterns faster and more conveniently using the edit sewing tool shortcut b i will drag a mark box around all the patterns and press delete to erase this way i can bring the garment back to its basic block after that i will remove the waste darts by using the edit pattern tool shortcut zed the sleeve isn't being modified right now so i will just move it to the side by using the transform pattern tool shortcut a once you have brought your 2d window to a suitable arrangement you can press the reset 2d arrangement tool in the 3d toolbar this will bring your 3d arrangement to the same layout as your 2d arrangement to prevent this leaf from falling to the ground during simulation right click on the sleeve pattern and select deactivate pattern only we will start by focusing on the 2d pattern window therefore i will select the 2d icon in the lower right corner to use only the 2d screen to start i will transform the pattern to have yolks and pleats as seen on the center back next i will make a yoke using the shoulder dart as my starting point using the edit pattern shortcut zed select the dark point whilst holding down control you will see two guided coordinate lines i will use the left line to extend my dart to meet on the baseline then using the trace tool i i will right click on the baseline and select cut from the list to merge the center back i will change to the edit pattern tool shortcut z and select both sides of the dart whilst holding shift and right click on one of the selected lines and merge now we have a backyard panel if you see a segment point on the shoulder line you can select it and delete this points khloe has also placed baselines of the original pattern outline to erase these you can use the trace tool to delete now by looking at the yoke you can see the balance is off and therefore needs to be corrected so first let's check the dart length using the z edit pattern tool and select the line to see the measurement to mark out the same length on the center back panel i will use the add point split line tool shortcut x from here i will right click on the center back line and type in 2.77 inches into line one now my lines have the same measurement then using the edit pattern tool shortcut zed i will bring down the yoke and the center back point by left clicking and dragging and right clicking at the same time from here i will type in 0.125 entrance into distance moved by looking at our flat drawing we can see the yoke as a single piece therefore we need to remove the curves and merge from the yoke panel i will change the center back line to be straight based on the neck point using the edit pattern tool shortcut z select both the top and the bottom points of the center-back joke whilst holding down shift then right-click on the neck point and select align to point y-axis now right click on the back curve line and select delete all curve points to make a straight line now the length between the right side hemline of the yoke and the upper side of the centre back body is different using the edit pattern tool i can select the yoke line and see the length from here i can right click on the center back line and select change length and input the same length the center back line of the back panel should also be straight so i will repeat the same steps as i did with the yoke using the edit pattern tool shortcut zed select both the top and the bottom points of the center back panel whilst holding shift then right click on the top point and select align to point y axis again right click on the back curve line and select delete all curve points to make a straight line the center back panel should also be merged and we will do this later once we've created our center back pleats therefore i won't merge for now and i will move on to the next step if you have made it this far we can now add the pleats to the center back using the pleats tool found in the 2d toolbar select the upper and lower points of the center back then select the pattern to get the pop-up window if i look at the specification i can see the half width of the pleat is 0.37 inches therefore i will put the same measurement into depth usually once you enter the value you can see a preview of the changes you're about to make however for this measurement you can't the reason is because i've drawn my pleat line on the pattern outline going inwards therefore the pleat is going in the opposite direction to what i want by selecting reverse direction you can see the police correctly if you look at the pleats there are red and blue lines these are fold angles the red line is set to an angle of zero meaning wrong sides together and the blue line is set to an angle of 360 meaning right sides together for this box pleat we need to reverse the line colors so below you can select reverse direction once you're done you can press ok this is how you can create pleats using the pleats tool the place doesn't need to go all the way down the center back but roughly three inches from the top of the yoke panel therefore using the z-edit pattern tool i will select the lines and drag them up whilst holding shift to lock on the axis grid i also don't need the segment points and notches anymore so i will delete the segment points using edit pattern then i will change the notch tool and repeat the same process moving back to where the yoke in the center back meets i will mark where the sewing connection between the pleat and the yoke is using the add point split line tool shortcut x i will mark 0.375 inches from the center back line as this is the half width of the pleats to do this right click on the line and type in the measurement into line one now moving back to the spec we can now adjust the shoulder seam forward measurement using z edit pattern right click on the shoulder seam and select offset as internal line then in the pop-up window type 0.5 inches to match the spec then press ok if you create a line like this there will be no segment point placed on the pattern outline as the internal line is separate to the pattern outline to amend this and to ensure simultaneous correction on the shoulder and neck i will right click on the internal line and select extend trim and add point to pattern outline now when i click on the point i get a drop down menu for both the pattern segment point and the internal line segment point if i move the internal line you can see a segment point has been added to the pattern outline we can now work on the neck width which will change from 6 inches to 5.5 inches we will have to change it by 0.25 inches to be half the distance on each side of the neck to do so select the edit pattern tool and drag the neck point whilst holding down shift on your keyboard move it inwards to reduce and as you're dragging right click and enter 0.25 and press ok because i shorten the width of the back neck i must do the same on the front neck repeat the same steps and input the same distance the shoulder width is 0.5 wider on the shirt block than it is on the base block therefore i will increase by 0.25 on each side of the shirt and sleeve point the back neck drop from hps is 0.75 therefore staying the same base on the spec however the front neck drop is being reduced from 3.25 to 3 inches therefore we need to add 0.25 by moving the point vertically up by holding shift and inputting the right measurement when you increase or decrease a pattern like this you can edit it on the x and y axis to the exact coordinate now i will lower the shoulder slope by 0.25 at the same time by selecting both the center front and center back shoulder points to lock it on the axis i will hold down shift the across front and back from the hps stays as they are at 5 inches however the across front width will increase by 0.75 from 12.5 to 13.25 inches across the whole body therefore half of that is 0.375 the same will apply for the cross back to move the center armhole point i will drag and move it and type in 0.375 inches as the back is split by the armhole with the yoke and the center back pieces i will select both points at the same time by holding down shift and increasing the distance at the same time to 0.375 inches after that i will lower the armhole position by 0.5 inches to do this correctly i will select both the center front and center back armhole points as well as the dart points and move them down vertically by 0.5 inches the original chest line marking is no longer sitting in the correct position therefore i will erase the baseline using the trace tool shortcut i by selecting them and deleting the baselines then using the internal polygon line tool shortcut g i will draw my new lines by clicking once at the start of the line holding shift to lock my axis grids and then double clicking to finish off the line i will repeat the same for the center front and the center back now looking at the spec we can change the chest width at the armhole there is a dart on the front bodice which will also need to be moved we can increase the chest width whilst also maintaining the dart length i will show you that in a bit the chest width has also increased to 20 inches to add the distance we will need to split that over the front and back bodices draw my keyboards to select the relevant points at the same time on the center front drag and type in 0.755 inches into the distance moved if you are unsure about the distance you can also see the increase on the internal line which will give you reassurance of the calculation you just made we're aiming for a line length of 10 inches similarly on the back i will select the point on this chest line and increase it to 10 inches by typing in 0.75 as you can see the new chest line width is set to be 20.006 once selecting the lines but as is a third of a decimal place it won't actually make much of a difference to the pattern therefore we can ignore and continue we will now work on increasing the length we will start here with the center back body length from hps hps stands for high point of shoulder it means the highest point of the shoulder when wearing the garment because we have offseted the shoulder line and we made it tilt forward the hps is actually the internal line where the shoulder line starts here so when you measure the garment you will have to measure it based on the hps from here based on the spec length we will increase it from 16.75 to 27.5 inches therefore using z-edit pattern we will select both the hemlines and drag down vertically and right-click under distance move we will input 10.75 inches to lengthen now moving on to increasing the hem width to 22 inches this will be split over 11 inches for both the front and the back bodices still using the edit pattern tool select the side seam hem point and drag and right click at the same time input the value based on the display length value that you can see in the bottom line segment repeat the same for the center back for the shirttail height i will select both the side seam hem points and raise the point position by three inches vertically up now we can add some shape into our hem i'm going to start by using the add point split line tool shortcut x and right click on the hemline from here i will use uniform split to position a segment point right in the middle of my segment line i'll repeat the same for the center front and center back i can now add some shape into my hem i will do this without using a separate curve tool instead i will use the z edit pattern tool whilst using that edit pattern i will hold down alt and you will see that the icon on the cursor changes into a curvature tool shape like this from this icon i can now left click and drag to create my curve as you will see the curved lines are vector based and contain bizarre handles on both sides to edit this curve you can manipulate the bezier handles further using the edit pattern tool repeat the same process across your hemline to create the desired curve shape the specification of the dart width and length are also different according to the specification to edit the dart select the dart using the edit pattern tool shortcut zed and then right click on the dart and select edit dart from the menu the dark arm width means half the depth of the dart so from here we can type in 0.75 in the length we can also enter the dart length on the specification sheet which is 5.25 and then press ok after entering this you will see that the shape has also been adjusted but you can further adjust this by using the guidelines for modifying the actual size seam use the red points and drag and move them to create the desired curved lines however let's say you wanted to change the shape to be straight instead you will actually need to delete these points instead to illustrate this i will undo my last steps and show you so repeat in the same steps of right clicking and selecting edit data and inputting the values that i would like i can now select the red points instead and delete them this way i will create a straight line be mindful of the sort of shape you would like to create once your dart is closed sometimes it's worth double checking your work if i select the dart again i can see the length of the line is slightly longer than intended to amend this i can select the dart point and drag it inwards the dart will be shortened based on the central line of the dots if i right click at the same time i can input the desired value that i would like always checking that the line measurement matches the one i have on my spec due to the manipulation of the dart the side seam lengths don't match anymore to rectify this i will need to start by marking the length of the center front armhole to the start of the dart length on the center back using z edit pattern i can check this length and then i can use the add point split line tool and right click on the center back side seam under line 1 i can input the same value then i can check the rest of the center back side seam using the z-edit pattern taking this line measurement i can change the sensor front measurement to match i can right click on the center front side seam and select change length from here i can input the same value as the back seam and change the direction to the end now we can check the patterns we've made on an avatar using the transform pattern tool shortcut a select all the patterns in your 2d window and then right click on one of the selected patterns and select symmetric pattern with sewing or shortcut ctrl d place the pattern pieces neatly on the other side whilst holding shift once you have a suitable arrangement you can start sewing by either using the end segment sewing tool or m3 sewing tool i will start by connecting my shoulder seams to each other alongside the side seams simply left clicking on each line from here i can close my darts as well as my center back york panel and my center back bodice when it comes to closing the yoke to the body you need to do it in two separate stages first closing the yoke to the body itself and then closing up the dots when sewing the dart i ensure that my notches are going in opposite directions and that always my sewing line type is turned i do this for each internal line then i can connect the last segment line to the center back yoke finally i can close my center front line now that i'm done sewing i can open up my split view again by using the icon in the bottom right window i can then select the 2d arrangement all in the 3d window to set my 3d arrangement to be the same as my 2d from here i can select all my pattern pieces in the 3d window and move them up so i have a nice clear view of my avatar using the 3d toggle bar i can go and select the show arrangement points or shortcut shift f to see my arrangement points to arrange a pattern piece i will select a pattern piece and then select an arrangement point in the 3d window sometimes the arrangement points are not 100 accurate therefore i need to use the arrangement in the property editor to do so using offset i can offset the pattern away from the body i will repeat the same on the center back as well i can either rotate using my mouse or i can press 8 on my keyboard to change my view from here we'll repeat the same process of selecting both the yoke and the center back panels and arrange it at the same time if the arrangement is not correct you can offset or change the position of the x and y axis under the property editor before simulation is always a good idea to check your arrangement if you're happy with the arrangement you can turn off your arrangement points with shift f and then you can press the space bar to simulate now gravity is applied and you can see how your body fits to make the garment even more accurate i'm going to merge my center back panels using z-edit pattern i can right click on one of the center-back lines and select merge from the drop-down menu i will repeat the same on the center-back yoke always simulate between every pattern change to see the four changes before working on this product any further it's a good idea to have the right fabric assigned to this garment the fabric that i'm currently using which is the muslin as you can see in the object browser it's quite sturdy and strong and not giving me a nice fluid drape that i want to achieve with this style i have several ways of adding a fabric that i want i can either digitize a fabric myself i can use one from the default library or i can purchase an additional one from closet connect closet connect is also linked to your library and clone by opening the library you can see that there's a link to closet connect and you can directly link up your closet account from there i have also added the link to the bottom of this video if you would like to see more so please subscribe once you enter closet connect you can see that you can purchase some additional garments fabrics trims and avatars i can also use closet connect to connect with different creators and freelancers that are all using clothes if i click the link for the fabric menu i will enter the fabric store there are many fabrics available so feel free to explore as much as you like however for this example i would like to use a crepe fabric to do this i will type in prep under search for fabrics once i press enter i can see that there is one fabric available so i will select this once i am on the fabric page i can use a 3d interactive viewer to rotate and preview my fabric if i am happy with my selection i can press download once your fabric is downloaded you can use it directly in chloe if you have your fabric library linked up in chloe you can drag and drop directly from the library onto the object browser and replace the entire fabric as you can see the new fabric is applied and if you simulate you will see that there is a new drape if you are happy with the new fabric you have assigned you can now move forward correcting the fit of the carbon to ensure an accurate fit i need to make sure that my top is in the correct position to do this in chloe you will use the avatar tapes from the 3d toolbar i will select basic tape measure avatar from here i will click once to start and double click to draw my shoulder seam line i will repeat the same on the other side once i've created my tape i now need to stick my seam line to the tape using the attach to measure avatar tool i will select the seam line and then the tape i need to simulate to see my changes you will notice that the seam line has now shifted to be in the position of the tape to further assist in the accuracy of my garment i will also lower the particle distance of all the pattern pieces select all the pattern pieces and go to particle distance under the property editor and change it to 5. you need to simulate to see your changes now that i've made all necessary changes for an accurate fitting i can review my garment when i zoom in on the center front neck i can see there's some gaping around the neckline as well when i rotate around my avatar's body i can see around her armhole there's also some gaping and some inaccuracy in terms of the fits however when i look at the hemline i can see that everything looks quite straight and seam lined so therefore i will probably maintain my hemline let's start by modifying the pattern on the neck and try to improve on the gaping that we see because there's gaping on the front of the neck we need to shorten the seam length at the front a little bit to do this i will select the entire shoulder line and move it inwards by 0.25 towards the center front now the length of the center front neck will be shorter than it was before because we moved the front neck inwards the armhole seam on the center front looks a bit tighter and miscontroled we will fix this later but for now we're going to move on to the back we will use the seam line where the yoke in the center back meet to amend the gaping we see on the armhole we will raise the yoke armhole segment point up by 0.125 inches and lower the same amount for the center back whilst doing this we will also maintain the segment point position on both bodices using z edit pattern left click and drag whilst holding shift and right click at the same time to input the measurement you want repeat the same for the lower half in order to see your changes fully you will need to simulate once you simulate you can see that the fit around the armhole has been proved a lot and the fit generally around the body sits a lot better with these minor improvements when looking at the center front neck point on the body we can see there is a pointed seam line what i want to do is amend the shaping around this part of the neck so it sits with a clean curve to do this i will use the edit pattern tool shortcut zed and right click on the center front neck point from the menu i will select perpendicular pattern corner this feature enables you to create 90 degree angles on a segment point line i'm going to create the 90 degree angle around 0.25 inches from the segment point and i will also set the direction to end so it's going on the neckline and not on the center front line now as you can see there's a 90 degree angle set 0.25 inches from the segment point on the neck you will also notice that the angle has been applied and there's also a perpendicular baseline to mark this change continuing on from the center front neck i will now check the entire neck seam around the whole body and i will use the shoulder seam connection to do this still using z edit pattern i will hold down shift and select both the center front and the center back shoulder lines with both lines selected i will right click on the back seam line and select match up to start from the menu the patterns will be matched based on the neck point which will give me a good view of the neck shaping looking at the patterns i think the back neck seam shaping looks fine but i want to fill in the center front neckline a little bit more to do this i will use a smooth curve tool with the tool i will click on the start of the perpendicular baseline and then left click on the neck unfortunately this is not working for me because the center back pattern is actually on top of the center front to amend this i will use the transform pattern tool shortcut a from here i will right click on the center front pattern and select order bring to front this will position my center front pattern piece on top of my center back from here i can go back to the smooth curve tool left click once on the perpendicular line and then left click on my next line from here i will select the original neckline and then left click on the reference line and redraw my curve now let's check the shaping around the armhole if you look closely at the shoulder line you can see that the front and back panels are slightly different what i will do first is bring the back panel forward so that i can manipulate the segment point i can right click and select order bring to front from here i can use z edit pattern and select the segment point on the center back shoulder and bring it forward to align with the center front when i look at the shoulder seam it looks like it's put in a little bit so i will select both segment points and move them ever so slightly to allow a little bit more ease i will also use the bezier handles on the center back to curve out the shape a bit in order to fix the center front i will first bring the pattern forward and then using the smooth curved torque i will round off my shape a little bit further feel free to adjust your shape and around your armhole as you see necessary using all the tools i've shown you previously now i can check the seam line where the yoke and the center back meet whilst looking at the seam line i can see that they're quite straight so using z edit pattern whilst holding down alt i will create a slight curved line across the seam i will do the same for both the yoke panel and also the center back panel we can now start by checking the shape of our back armhole i will start by matching up the center back panel with the yoke and checking the shape on the armhole from there in order to invent the center back armhole first i will need to bring the pattern piece forward i will use a transform pattern and select bring to front from here i will use the smooth curve tool to shape out my center back armhole you will notice that when i try to select both points of the armhole i am unable to do so the reason for this is that the segment point on the internal line is also interfering with this therefore i will need to convert this internal line into a baseline to do this i will switch to z edit pattern right click on the internal line and select convert to baseline from here i can go back to the smooth curve tool click once on the bottom of my armhole and then once at the top of my armhole then i can select the armhole line and then reselect the reference line and redraw my curve as you can see i now have a smoother curve around my armhole i can now realign my pattern pieces to sit neatly in the 2d window i can either select the pattern with transform pattern and use the rotation wheel or alternatively i can right click on the pattern select rotate y-axis and then select my center front line i can repeat the same on the center back by right clicking on the center back panel selecting rotate and then x-axis and then i can select the line that meets my yoke moving on i can now check my armhole at the side seam using zed edit pattern i can select both lines that match up the side seam with the armhole from here i need to convert my internal line into a baseline so i will right click on this line and select convert to baseline so i have no interference my center front panel is sat behind my center back therefore using transform pattern shortcut a i will order and bring to front now using the smooth curve tool i can repeat the same steps and smooth out the shape on my center front armhole i think the new shape and sits quite well across the center front and the bottom half of the center back panel to ensure the whole armhole fits well i will line up my center back yoke with my center back panel and check the entire armhole i think the shaping across the entire armhole looks pretty good i can now check how our side seam matches up at the hem using z-edit pattern i will select both side seam panels and this time i will match up to the end as you can see there is a point where our side seam at the hems meets therefore using the smooth curve tool i will repeat the same steps and smooth out the curve of the hemline i will repeat the same for both the center front and the center back hemlines once you are done creating the curve on your hemline you can rotate your pattern pieces to sit straight again in the 2d window now we can check the shaping on our center front hem using z edit pattern i can right click on the hem line and select duplicate as mirrored internal line from here i can left click on the center front line and as you will see you have a mirrored image of the center front hemline looking at this reference line i can see that there is a dip in the center front hem line therefore still using z edit pattern i will right click on the center front segment point and select perpendicular pattern corner from here i will square off the center front corner by 0.5 inches from the center front line now i will use a smooth curve tool to reshape the center front hemline i will start from the second segment point on the hemline and draw a line to connect just before the perpendicular baseline from here i will reshape my hem shape i will now move on and check my center back hemline i can see there is a slight dip again at the center back seam therefore using z edit pattern i will right click and cut my center back line from here i will right click on the segment point at my center back and select perpendicular pattern corner again i will type in 0.5 into the length and ensure that the direction goes towards the end the rest of my curve shape looks quite good therefore i will right click on one of the center back lines and merge now i will select any of the extra segment points that you see around the hem and right click and convert to curve point now that i am done editing my pattern pieces i can reopen my split view to see my 3d window before i simulate i will use the edit measure avatar tool to delete my measure tapes i will right click on one of the tapes and select delete measure i'll repeat the same on the other side from here i can simulate and see the changes i have made to my garment so this is everything for the first part on how to modify the shirt pattern in the second video we'll be focusing on how to modify the color and placket of the shirts in the meantime if you have any questions or any feedback whilst

        "Summary": "# Comprehensive Guide to Creating a Shirt Pattern Using a Basic Block This guide provides detailed step-by-step instructions on how to create a shirt pattern from a basic block pattern using specific software (Clove). It outlines essential definitions, tips, and tricks to ensure an efficient process. ## Definitions - **Basic Block Pattern**: A foundational pattern used in garment making that serves as the basis for creating other styles. - **Point of Measure (POM)**: Specific measurement points on the garment which help in the creation of the pattern. - **Segment Points**: Points that define the shape of the pattern and can be manipulated to alter the design. - **Curve Points**: Points that allow for smooth curves in the design, as opposed to straight lines. ## Preparation 1. **Download and Unzip Files**: Download the shirt specification and block pattern file from the provided link and unzip it. 2. **Load Project File**: Open Clove and load the project file. ## Step-by-Step Instructions ### 1. Set Up Your Workspace - **Close the Library**: Use the shortcut `Y` to close the library as it won’t be needed for this tutorial. ### 2. Modify the Basic Block 1. **Delete Half of the Block**: - Use the **Transform Pattern Tool** (shortcut `A`) to select the right half of the body pattern and press `Delete`. 2. **Delete Notches and Segment Points**: - Select the **Notch Tool**, drag a mark key box around all pattern pieces, and press `Delete`. - Use the **Edit Pattern Tool** (shortcut `Z`) to select all unnecessary segment points and right-click to press `Convert to Curve Point`. ### 3. Reset the Pattern - Select all patterns with the **Edit Sewing Tool** (shortcut `B`) and press `Delete` to revert to the basic block. ### 4. Adjust the Yoke and Pleats 1. **Create a Yoke**: - Use the **Edit Pattern Tool** (shortcut `Z`) to select the dart point, extend it, and merge the center back. - Adjust the dart length as necessary using the **Add Point Split Line Tool** (shortcut `X`). 2. **Add Pleats**: - Select the upper and lower points of the center back and use the **Pleats Tool** to add pleats, ensuring to reverse the direction if necessary. ### 5. Adjust Measurements - Use the **Edit Pattern Tool** (shortcut `Z`) to check and adjust measurements according to the specifications. - Adjust the shoulder seam and neck width as per the measurements outlined in the specifications. ### 6. Shape the Hem 1. **Add Shape to the Hem**: - Use the **Add Point Split Line Tool** (shortcut `X`) to create segment points along the hem. - Use the **Edit Pattern Tool** while holding `Alt` to create curves. ### 7. Adjust the Dart - Select the dart and adjust its width and length according to the specification using the **Edit Dart** menu. ### 8. Simulate the Fit - Use the **Transform Pattern Tool** (shortcut `A`) to select all patterns and right-click to create a symmetric pattern with sewing. - Use the sewing tools to connect shoulder seams, side seams, and darts. ### 9. Final Adjustments - Check the fit of the garment on an avatar by simulating the garment. - Adjust any areas that show gaping or misalignment, especially around the neckline and armholes. ### 10. Fabric Assignment - Use **Closet Connect** to find and apply suitable fabrics to achieve the desired drape and fit. ### 11. Measure and Fine-Tune the Fit - Use the **Avatar Tape Measure** to mark important seam lines. - Adjust the fit based on measurements and ensure the garment sits correctly on the avatar. ### 12. Clean Up - Once satisfied, delete any measuring tapes and finalize the simulation. ## Tips and Tricks - **Shortcuts**: Familiarize yourself with keyboard shortcuts to improve efficiency during the pattern-making process. - **Backup Work**: Regularly save your work to prevent data loss. - **Utilize Guidelines**: Use POM and specifications as guides to ensure accuracy in measurements and adjustments. - **Simulate Frequently**: Regularly check your adjustments through simulation to see how they affect the overall fit and drape of the garment. ## Conclusion Following these steps will allow you to create a modified shirt pattern efficiently from a basic block pattern. Remember to check against specifications regularly and utilize the simulation feature to visualize your adjustments. For further modifications such as color and placket, refer to the subsequent video tutorial."

        "publishedAt": "2022-02-09T22:52:05Z",
        "Transcript": "hi my name is sadie and today we're going to go through how to make a puffer jacket but with the new build tool that was released in 6.2 so let's jump on in and have some fun while we learn okay so here we have our closed screen open ready to go and here we don't have any internal lines yet so we're going to add some if you watch that any editing video then you editing trick 6.2 edition um then you know about this new update with internal lines but if you haven't guess what you're about to learn it right now so get excited um what we're going to do is go to our editing tool and i'm going to select both my front and back at the same time because i want this to be done at the same time or getting smart not hard and all i'm going to do is right click go to offset internal line and now with our pop-up box you're going to see that you can do number of offsets as always so i'm going to do 12. and distance now there's a drop down so you could do all so that they all have the same distance as before or you can do individual so that each one has an individual distance and that is the cool update there's more don't worry so also with this offset you can do offset from so it can be previous or selected let's do selected so with the selected line it's doing so from this first selected line and then how much it's offsetting from that line so for the first one we're going to say one inch from the first line then we're going to say 3 inches then let's do 4 6. down three do seven and nine i'm doing all of this math in my head and i'm really proud of myself 12. you can start to see now that there's a preview and you can start to see my vision for this there we go i did that correctly and i'm really proud of myself for that i'm gonna hit okay and now i have these internal lines added into my um garment so now that i have these internal lines added in i'm now going to go to our new fill tool okay so with this fill tool i'm going to select this and holding down shift i'm going to select all of these pattern pieces here that i want to add my fill to i'm now going to release shift and i'll have the outlines of these and i can just drag this down and click right now now what i forgot to add internal lines to my sleeve no worries i can go back to my editing pattern tool and just go to my sleeve here right click i'm going to say offset internal line instead of selected i'm going to do previous so now what this is reading is it's reading um from each previous internal line so now i'm going to say 2 inches 3 2 inches and then 0.5 and then 2 inches from that and then 0.5 so you can see like now you can do the measurements a little differently so it's going to be like two inches i'm gonna do two inches from that like half inch line and then i want half an inch from that two inch line and then two inches you already just want half an inch yeah okay and then half an inch two inches half of it okay and you can see that the preview is all right here i'm happy i can hit okay now it's applied to all four pattern pieces which is great i'm going to go back to my fill tool now so with my fill tool i know when something's activated or when it's applying the fill because there's going to be a purple outline around it so these internal lines that i just added do not have that purple outline on them or like lying around them that means they are not activated they're gray so i can just use my marquee box and click on top of click over all of them to then activate them all very quickly i'm going to do the same to the other side so being able to deactivate and activate is actually really nice especially if you have certain like patches on top of things or if you have internal lines for pockets you can deactivate them or activate them as you see fit it's a really nice add-on that we should all be very happy about all right so now everything's activated we're ready to go now let's just select all of these pattern pieces just so you know so the ones that you select these are like this one below this is linked up to this so you only have to select one set and then you're good to go so over here in our property editor we see some new information in filler we're gonna have some options for different fill types we've got duck 75 25 duck 90 10 goose 80 20 and goose 90 10. i'm gonna do doc 9010 now you can put in your weight so this is one thing you should know if you here i'm going to like select this sleeve and i'm going to put in my weight 75. this sleeve is going to now be 75 grams um same with this one like this and put in 75 now if i select my front and my back and if i put in 130 that 130 is going to be divided amongst all four all three of these patterns so now you see it's 31 31 67 so this is divided amongst it all now if i wanted 130 for each pattern piece then i have to select and say 130. or secret menu alert get excited i could just select all three go to my weight right click get a calculator and i could have done 130 times three equals and hit okay this will update and then i'll have that now it does distribute it based off of like the size of the pattern and everything so sometimes it won't evenly do it but it does distribute it so that's just a good thing to know i'm going to do 130 but i'm going to keep these what they were all right so i'm going to show you all something i hope you took so that you can learn it so here if i have my weight i've inputted the fill and if i hit just simulate pop-up box is going to come up this is cool telling you you have forgotten a step it's okay we all forget so this is saying you we've failed to calculate the fill volume please ensure that you have entered the accurate value of the weight and floating distance so what we haven't done is add in the quilting distance so it's just telling us that it's still going to simulate what's going to happen is it's not going to simulate correctly like you're not going to see the highs and lows like you'd want to so i'm going to just turn simulation off control z and now i'm going to select my body fat um pattern pieces i'm going to enter this quilting distance all right the wizarding distance is if you go to this little eye information it's going to give you all the information you need to know about what to input for this quilting distance some of you might have these questions i'm going to answer them right now what if your quilting lines variate it's okay just put in the largest amount what if you have horizontal and vertical quilting lines it's okay just put in the largest amount what if you have diamond shaped clothing lines it's okay just put in the largest amount the answer will normally be to your question it's okay just put in the largest amount so what i mean by that is just put in the um largest amount of distance between the two so for this one it's three inches so i'm going to put in three there's another distance here to here but that's not what i care about um i want this quilting distance from here to here however if you if you're curious we're gonna be here this is four inches this is five so if you really wanted to um we can we can do that so for here i'll actually show you so for the body pad for the front pattern pieces we're going to stick with three for the back one we're going to do 4.5 okay for the sleeve for this one we're gonna do two inches but for this one we're gonna do five now what we're going to do is hit simulate now you see the difference so with the five what's happening is it knows this is the largest so it knows that this largest one should be filled completely and so it's taking that and then it's calculating all the rest so you do see that there is a slight difference same with the back so another thing i want to call out to us all is all of these pattern pieces are at particle distance of 20. this is going to look a lot better when you lower your particle distance i'm going to lower it down to 10. another callout i'm going to make though is that is going to slow down your computer a bit so when i lowered it down to 10 i'm now going to hit simulate and you're going to see even more of a difference between all of these so again this sleeve has a five um quilting distance this one has a two the front has a three the back the back has a four so something like a four and a three you really don't start to see the difference but for something of a five and a two you do so just know that and know like put in what's best and what like you want the look to be back like so it should actually be more consistent and like less of uh indents and difference like this one is then you should put into but if you if it should have a lot of a difference then you should put in the truest largest amount just gonna let this so you follow it but as um as you can see having it at 10 it does slow it down a bit okay another thing i want to call out when you're out of the fill tool and you select a sleeve you're then go into your property editor and you see if you scroll all the way down to simulation properties and then you're gonna see filler you'll then see exactly what you input here and you can make changes here in your property editor one question that might be coming up is what happened to pressure don't you worry it's still here but it's just not applied to pattern pieces that have the fill however if i select like these waistbands you see that there is still pressure the pressure option so you still have pressure as an option if you'd like it one final thing that we can cover is i'm going to select these pattern pieces of these and i'm going to scroll up here we have realistic quilting lines i can check this actually let me just check on the front i'm going to check on the front for realistic quilting lines this is going to do is it's going to add a little bit more realism to the quilting and you'll be able to see the difference between this and your sleeves it does slow down your computer a bit just a heads up but you can start to see how this looks a little bit more realistic and everything this especially versus this then all we have to do is add in some fabrics change some stuff around and jump into our render window and you can get something that looks just like this with our new fill tool i hope you enjoyed this video if you have any questions please write them down in the comments section somebody will get back to you um please don't forget to like and subscribe as i've said before we have a lot of great content here and you can learn just so much thanks so much for watching and i hope you enjoyed everything you ",
        "Summary": "# Comprehensive Guide to Making a Puffer Jacket Using the New Build Tool (Version 6.2) ## Introduction In this guide, we will walk you through the process of creating a puffer jacket using the new build tool introduced in version 6.2. This guide will cover each step in detail, including definitions, instructions, tips, and tricks to enhance your design experience. --- ## Step-by-Step Instructions ### Step 1: Open the Editing Tool 1. **Open the Closed Screen**: Launch the design software and open the closed screen. 2. **Add Internal Lines**: If there are no internal lines in your pattern, you will need to add them. ### Step 2: Add Internal Lines 1. **Select Pattern Pieces**: Use the editing tool to select both the front and back pattern pieces by holding down the `Shift` key. 2. **Right-Click and Offset Internal Line**: - Right-click on the selected pieces. - Choose `Offset Internal Line` from the context menu. 3. **Set Number of Offsets**: In the pop-up box, input the number of offsets. For example, enter `12`. 4. **Choose Distance Type**: - Select either `All` for uniform distance or `Individual` for varied distances. 5. **Offset From**: Choose `Selected` to offset from the first selected line. 6. **Input Distances**: Enter the distances for the offsets (e.g., 1 inch, 3 inches, 4 inches, etc.). 7. **Preview and Confirm**: Check the preview to ensure it looks correct, then click `OK`. ### Step 3: Add Internal Lines to the Sleeve 1. **Select the Sleeve**: Navigate to the sleeve pattern piece. 2. **Right-Click and Offset Internal Line**: Follow the same steps as in Step 2, but choose `Previous` as the offset method. 3. **Input Distances**: Enter the required distances (e.g., 2 inches, 3 inches, etc.). 4. **Preview and Confirm**: Check the preview and click `OK`. ### Step 4: Using the Fill Tool 1. **Select Pattern Pieces**: Hold down the `Shift` key and select all pattern pieces where you want to apply the fill. 2. **Access the Fill Tool**: - Click on the fill tool. 3. **Drag and Click**: Drag over the selected pieces and click to apply the fill. ### Step 5: Weight and Fill Properties 1. **Input Weight**: - Select each piece and enter the desired weight (e.g., 75 grams for the sleeve). 2. **Distributing Weight**: - Select multiple pieces and input a total weight. The software will distribute this weight based on the size of the pattern pieces. - For precise distribution, you can use the formula (e.g., `130 * 3 = 390 grams`). ### Step 6: Set Quilting Distance 1. **Select Body Pattern Pieces**: Choose the main body pattern pieces. 2. **Access Quilting Distance**: - Click on the small `i` for information to understand the input requirements. 3. **Input Quilting Distances**: Enter the largest distance for quilting (e.g., 3 inches for the front, 4.5 inches for the back). 4. **Simulate**: Click `Simulate` to see the results. ### Step 7: Adjust Particle Distance 1. **Change Particle Distance**: Lower the particle distance for better simulation quality (e.g., change from 20 to 10). 2. **Simulate Again**: Click `Simulate` to view the updated results. ### Step 8: Final Adjustments 1. **Review Simulation Properties**: Access the property editor for each pattern piece to make any final adjustments. 2. **Check for Pressure Settings**: Ensure the pressure settings are still available for non-filled pattern pieces. 3. **Enable Realistic Quilting Lines**: - Select the front piece and enable realistic quilting lines for added detail. - Be aware that this may slow down your computer's performance. ### Step 9: Rendering 1. **Add Fabrics**: Choose and apply fabrics to your design. 2. **Open Render Window**: Jump into the render window to view your finished puffer jacket design. --- ## Definitions - **Offset Internal Line**: A tool that allows you to create internal lines within a pattern based on specified distances. - **Fill Tool**: A feature used to apply fill properties to selected pattern pieces, simulating the material's volume and weight. - **Quilting Distance**: This refers to the distance between quilting lines in a puffer jacket, which affects the filled appearance. - **Particle Distance**: This setting influences the simulation quality and performance of the software during rendering. --- ## Tips and Tricks - **Plan Your Internal Lines**: Before adding internal lines, sketch a rough idea of where you want them to ensure they align with your design vision. - **Use Preview Features**: Always utilize the preview function to check your adjustments before finalizing. - **Experiment with Weight Distribution**: Don’t hesitate to experiment with different weight distributions to see how they affect the overall look. - **Keep the Computer Load in Mind**: Lowering the particle distance enhances detail but can slow down your computer. Adjust based on your system’s capabilities. - **Save Progress Frequently**: Regularly save your work to avoid losing any changes. --- ## Conclusion Creating a puffer jacket using the new build tool in version 6.2 is a straightforward process once you understand the tools at your disposal. By following these steps and utilizing the tips provided, you can create a detailed and realistic puffer jacket design.

        "Transcript": "hi my name is phoebe and i'm going to walk you through how you can take some of your graded patterns and pair them with avatars so that you can then use our great grade review mode now some of you might know our grade review mode was introduced in 6.1 i believe actually i think it was 6.0 um anyways it's been around for a bit and what it has been is it's been updated in 6.2 so what i'm going to show you is one how you can set it all up so that you can then use it and two how you can take some of those um project files that you've set up in later versions of pro and just prep them so that you can use them in this newer version of glow so let's get started so we've got our file open here and we have our pattern pieces graded out so you can check that because over in your object browser there's your graded tab here and you can click here and you see that my shirt is graded out one way and my skirt's graded out another also if you go to your 2d toggle menu all of you already know this already you can hit this little gradient icon and then you can see how your garments are created okay so now let's go to the pair avatar tab so this is the top that you're going to use to then get to your grade review mode so let's go up here and here i just have my sizes so i have small medium large extra large this is for both of them so i'm going to go to my pair and what i'm first going to have to do is i'm going to hit update and now i'm going to update this now you see below where it's a size 4 size 4 size 4 size 4. yeah you see that now okay so that is what's going to be replaced with our new avatar sizes so this first one is going to actually stay size four and then the medium large and extra large are going to switch to different avatar sizes the first thing we just have to do here is we have to click on this little button over here it's called our avatar um like it's where you compare your avatar so pair 3d form this is not okay fun fact this does not have to be a club avatar it can be a custom avatar if you like um but just some things won't work like redrain but it's okay so i'm gonna go to this little button here and i'm going to hit size 4 because i'm just going to be safe and pair it with size 4. okay now i'm going to simulate so this is going to stimulate and everything and it's going to be all set fantastic we've got a garment we've got one down three to go okay now i'm going to click my medium you're now going to see that there's like sewing lines and stuff showing up because this is like change the size so it's become a little bit bigger so now what we're gonna do is we're gonna go to our pair 3d form again and now we're going to click size 8 because size 8 is a medium now accept that and we're going to simulate again and all set okay now we're going to do mark and pair that we're going to go with size 12. now instead of hitting simulate because i'm using our claw avatars which are great because they come with rape skeletons and they work with and glow really easily and well not to say that custom avatars don't they do um but one of the great things that crow avatars have is you can use this redrape thing this redrape button it's nothing it's a button so i can hit redrape and what will happen is it will redrape it on this larger size which is really great because that's gonna like make everything go a lot faster well maybe not faster but easier maybe i should have some elevator reasons okay so now this is great off that and now some of you might be like it's messed up what happens well if all of you remember there's a thousand different ways to do everything in quo and there's so many different helping tools in quo to like solve anything one of the tools i'm going to use is this layering so i'm going to click layer one and now i'm going to simulate look at that it tucks her head it's like finished and i'm going to just play around with it a little bit so that it looks i don't know more like what i want i can now just align my square again turn this off to zero i can simulate once more okay great and now we've got our last size this has been done so quickly like someone is not like how great is that did you like that even snap for emphasis i hope you did i forgot to check it off i was just so excited about the snap so what we're going to do is we're going to check the large i already paired it now we're going to simulate i could have done the re-drape again but i just wanted to simulate to show you all that you can simulate you can re-drape you can do either what could have been helpful especially for such a larger size is when i did simulate i could have then selected the skirt and done layer one again so that put it just to help go out a little bit but again chloe doesn't really need much help it normally figures things out on its own okay wow we did it now before we jump into grade review mode i just want to quickly show you if you had a file from an older version so i have this same exact file but it's from 6.1 so if i go to this older version and i even see pair avatar you'll see that i already have these sizes if you have something like this already set up and you've set it all up in older versions do not worry all you have to do is go through to the other versions and just quickly simulate them all you should get a little pop-up box that comes up when you first open up the old grade review file and it will just tell you to do this but all you have to do is this you just have to click through the other sizes and just quickly simulate them all and then the information will then go into the new grade review updates and stuff and then you can read all of the different um fit maps and stuff and all of that which is really nice so again i'm just going to do layer one and this is going by like a snap as well and then orange it's a little messy but again it's gonna fix itself up which is always nice okay so once that's all that you can then just jump straight into greater vegan and all of that information is going to be in there as you can see so i have it on layer one which is why you see all these skirts in green let's jump to the um original file we were working on them this one and let's fix that mistake and now let's jump to greater remote all right so here i have great review mode because i took layer one off the squares aren't in green but now you can see all of your sizes all together so if you right click and hold you can rotate all together you can pan you can zoom in and all of that so all of the things that we know about this review mode from our previous versions are still true today i'll quickly review it all for everyone just in case um somebody may have forgotten or anything like that so you can rotate them all together if you'd like you can zoom them all in and out and you can pan them you can also lock and unlock so you can just rotate one if you'd like you can lock this again so that all of them rotate together you also have the option of changing your view so you can do a wrap which is what this is right now you could do horizontal and you can also do vertical i'm gonna go back to the wrap you can also um do a full um screen and just hit escape to go back and if you'd like you can even change out your sizes so i can lock my aspect ratio here and i can say this is actually six um oh that was way too big that's not what i wanted 600 by 900 and then you can see with a wrap then i'll like roll um move this down and then i'll see the other side so you can do that um i'm gonna go back to 400. and also you can save all of these before we do that i'm going to take you through the new updates so one new update is with our fabric mode so now you can view different fabrics so you can do thick texture monochrome translucent which is really nice because you can see all um how it's hitting on your avatar and everything like that and you can also do a mesh view one other thing i just wanted to point you all to my graphic did change in size when you like changed it up that's why it's like still um like in the same placement and looks proportional to each size because i made sure that it changed so you can edit graphic sizes based off of the different size of your graph and then the fun update is the fitmaps so here you can do your stress map how helpful is that right it's so helpful so you can do the stress and you can do your strain map like the most helpful if you want to know more about stress and strain maps and fitting maps there is a youtube video done by one of our other designers who walks you through how to read all of this it's really informative i suggest checking it out to get out you just have to click on the map again and then it will get out and then finally you also can change around how you view your avatar so right now we have textured surface you could do monochrome or you could even do a mesh we're going to go back to texture so those are the updates what's really nice is if you go into stress map you could then hit this save button and now you could do um set uh review and hit save and you can do transparent background and save separate images hit save and then just go back you can view them and then you have them all saved out let's open so here you have it saved out and you can scroll through which is really nice and would be really great for fittings so this is the update with great review i hope you really enjoyed watching this video if you have any questions please feel free to comment below uh one of the cool designers will get back to you as always and please don't forget to like and subscribe this channel we have so many great and helpful things to watch and to learn about um thanks again for watching hope you

        "Transcript": "hi my name is phoebe and i'm going to walk you through some of the great new features that have been introduced in close 6.2 along with some new feature improvements as well so if you have any questions please feel free to ask in the chat if you're watching this live however if you're not because you were too busy or something please feel free to respond in the comments below and a close designer will get back to you we really hope you enjoy all of these new features and i can't wait to introduce them all to you so let's get started we have a new tool called the fill tool this fill tool is going to allow you to more accurately and easily add in fill to puffy garments quilted garments accessories home goods all of that so let's go into exactly how this works now as you can see i've got my jacket dx patterns here in my 2d window and i already have some internal lines on there for quilting lines so if i go to my fill tool here and select it i'll then start to just see the outlines of the patterns i can now select which pattern pieces i want to apply this fill to i can either click on each one use my marquee box or hold down shift to select multiple i'm going to hold down shift to select multiple and once i release shift it will then place this fill now onto my pattern pieces now i have the fill applied to these pattern pieces and you can see because they're outlined in purple even those internal lines that were once read are now purple now you can see off to our property editor that this is some new information which we'll get to in a minute but let's quickly just talk about the internal lines so i have internal lines on my body but i want to add them to my sleeve i can do that at any point of this process so i'm going to do that right now and add some internal lines to my sleeve as you can see they've applied to both symmetric pattern pieces and both layers which is really great and when i go to the fill you'll see that they're now activated you can actually deactivate these quilting lines as well if you wanted by just clicking on them activated means purple deactivated will be gray now let's go into adding some fill so i'm going to just select all of my pattern pieces and off to the side of my property editor let's go through the fill options we have four different fill options we've got duck 75 25 fill duck 90 10 we have goose 80 20 and goose 90 10. so these are the four fills we have at the moment you can select any one of them that you would wish to use and then you can start to apply your weight the weight is going to allow you to either apply all of your pattern pieces and the weight will then distribute between each one like so so i put in 120 and now you can see that this pattern piece is at a different weight could also just select one pattern piece and apply the weight to that whole pattern piece if i'd like the next thing i'm going to do is apply my quilting line information so my front and back quilting lines are the same so i'm going to put in 14 centimeters because that's how far apart these lines are for my sleeve though i'm going to put in a different number since that quilting distance is a little bit different i'm going to put in 12 centimeters now if you go over to your quilting line you're going to see this little question mark icon if you hover over it this is going to give you a more in-depth information on exactly what this does and how it calculates the the quilting volume and everything once i'm all set i can just easily hit this simulation button and with a click of the space bar i now have a puffy jacket how cool one final thing i do want to show you all though is that realistic quilting that you saw in the property editor so if i go back to my pattern pieces and if i select this here you'll see that the realistic quilting is checked off if i check it on to apply a more realistic puffy look which you can see here you can actually compare what it looks like from the realistic quilting to a non-realistic quilting on the sleeve adding realistic quilting will be great once you're finished with your garment so we have created a folding feature within close 6.2 this will make it easier and faster to fold within clo so all of those scenes that you want to do with folded garments it's now going to be so much easier and faster to do this all we're going to do is first prep the garment so we're going to use this women's sweater and we're first going to select the garment using our 2d window and then we're going to use those gizmos tools to rotate it and bring it down to the ground as you can see here now once it's placed on the ground we can then simulate it so that it lies flat great now we're ready to go to the folding tool so the folding tool is off to the left toolbar or your 3d toolbar if you want to think about it like that and we're going to now go over there and select this toolbar here it is here's the folding tool so once you select that there's going to be a pop-up box that appears and you're going to have a few more options from there we're going to go over all of these options now the first option you have actually in this little box with all the tools is this rotating option this is going to rotate your garment along the x-axis so as you can see here this will rotate it the next option is the flip tool so this is going to flip the garment so that you can fold either the front or the back we're going to keep it on the back so that we can fold it in the back now we also have the fold settings so this is a little bit like that high res and low res but these are how to have it for when you're folding it's going to be set at 10 millimeters instead of 5 or 20. once that's all set we can then simulate and have it settle the other tool that you can use is this spreading tool this tool works a little bit like strengthening does what it will do is it will spread your garment out so that there aren't really any wrinkles this is going to be nice because you're going to then be able to fold it a little bit easier as you can see now this tool will go back to the settings and it will keep it up at settings of what you first click so that 10 millimeter for particle distance and everything now we get to the fun part here's the folding so the first fold tool will fold the entire garment so any pattern and garment that is in this window will be affected by this next tool which is the folding tool so it's this one what you do is you just quickly click once to start away from your garment and then you're going to double click to end and you're going to like pick the line on which you want it to fall once you double click to end a gizmo tool is going to come up see and here it's going to look a lot like that fold arrangement tool that we all know and love so you're going to pick one of the arrows i'm going to pick the green one and you're going to click and hold down and you're just going to fold your garment over if you hold down shift it will do like the 45 degree angles but i'm just going to eyeball it once it's good there i'm now going to just simulate you can also hit escape to get out of the tool the folding tool so great now let's go to this other folding tool this other folding tool is really neat because it will allow you to select certain pattern pieces to fold so if you don't want the entire garment affected you can here just select your pattern pieces like i'm going to do here in my 3d window and then once i've selected the pattern pieces i want i'll then hit enter now only this sleeve is going to be affected by the folding and again i'm going to just click to start double click to end and then use these arrows to fold it the direction that i want pretty easy right so nifty i can then simulate or i can continue to fold if i wish but i'm going to simulate here and now to get the folded garment that i want i'm going to either use my hand tool or the rest of these fold tools to fold this sweater so i'll just be using the full tool for either the whole garment and sometimes i'll switch to that full tool where i'll have to select certain pattern pieces so i feel like this is the coolest part because i'm able to fold the back so quickly and easily in a matter of seconds like look at that done now i can just quickly and easily flip my garment back over to the front simulate again have everything settle down and i'm going to use that folding tool the original one because when i go to my sleeve the sleeve pattern isn't directly over any other pattern piece so if i just fold this it won't affect any other pattern piece because it's not in directly on top of anything else so i can just use this fold tool and fold my sleeve over so that you have this really nice and professional looking fold and there you have it a great little folded sweat sweater already in 6.2 we have added a link to close set from clo this will allow our users to more easily move between clo and close closet so in our library tab you're going to see an updated icon with a little cloud and a c if you click on that you're going to notice that it's blank if you haven't signed in yet if you've already signed in then you'll see your account there now if you need to add your account that's really easy all you have to do is go into the add account button so which will be at the top right so once i go into this little button add account i can then hit the little plus ad account this will immediately take you into close at where you can either sign into your account or create an account these accounts are free so i'd create one if you don't have one you can then just hit sign in and you'll immediately then be logged in in clone you can then just hit close close sorry let's quickly jump back into the close set screen now close that can be used for a multitude of reasons it is though at its core a communication platform along with kind of a storage platform too with this update of linking closed set and cloud together you can now more easily upload and download and then update your garments and styles and everything and you can do that now between closet and club by going into a work room you can either favorite a specific style or you could favorite an entire work room they will then be linked back into clo into this little library here you can hit the refresh tab and then you'll see the update so here i can click my favorite content and i'll see if i favorited any styles or not by hitting the refresh tab this closed set tab is going to work just like your theore library works double clicking on workrooms or anything like that we'll then open up them all down below so that you can see each file and everything you can then download files and then quickly open them into clo if you'd like and then adjust them any way you'd see fit as more users continue to use close at questions may arise if you do have any questions please feel free to reach out to hello at closet.com one of the closet team members will respond back to you as quickly as possible we've also added this new feature it's called replace patterns super cool um this will allow you to quickly and easily update patterns while keeping the arrangement sewing fabric top stitching and internal lines all intact so let's jump into it what i'm going to do is i'm going to bring in a dxf pattern and i'm just going to right click and add this into my workspace as i normally would the important thing to know is that you have to make sure that the pattern you're going to use to replace must have the same amount of segment points as the pattern you're replacing so as you can see here i have the same amount of segment points but the segment lines don't have to be the same length or anything just the points have to be the same amount so here i'm going to go to my select tool and i'm going to select this sleeve right click and copy it i could also hit ctrl c as a shortcut and now i'm going to go into one of my symmetrical sleeves right click and say replace pattern this is what i'm going to use to replace that sleeve what's nice is when i replace this pattern both symmetrical sleeves are going to be updated also as we've talked about already that internal line stays and all of the relationships with the internal lines stay as well so you can continue to move that around also the top stitching stays and if you noticed the fabric stays as well and the graphic will stay too if we jump into our 3d window you'll notice that the sewing relationship is still intact along with the arrangement one of the coolest things is also that patch on top of the sleeve that is also still intact like all of the sewing relationship to that internal shape all of that still there so what are some things that will be replaced well that will be the point position curves notches baseline pattern name and grading in front one other thing to know is if you're replacing a half symmetric pattern like these two body pieces you have to make sure that your patterns are also half symmetrical so i'm just going to quickly and easily select these two pattern pieces and make them half symmetric by just right clicking and doing that now i can go along and copy and replace my pattern and what you're going to see here are the things that will be replaced first off let's select this first pattern and you'll see the name here when i replace it with this pattern you'll see that the name of this pattern is going to change as you can see it's now cropped another thing to notice is that the baselines have been updated and even the grading information is now updated so the grading information that was from that dxf is now onto this pattern even if i delete this dxf that grading information will still be there so that's really nice i can continue to adjust the style around edit the internal lines move everything get it all to the positioning that i want and then once i'm all happy with everything i can quickly simulate but i'm just going to move this graphic around get the placement just right and now with a quick space bar hit i've got a whole new garment so this is going to be really great because this feature can come in handy for like a multitude of things just one is being able to simply update a popular style for a new season with a different body you're now going to be able to adjust the grading of each size so here i've applied grading to this pattern and if i go into my grading tool i can then select edit grading here i can check what my grading is between each size i can then go into the edit grading each tool here i can select one of my graded sizes and easily click and drag and move it around i could also use my arrow keys to move them around in our precise measurement as well if i wanted i can then recheck what my distance is and you'll see in my property editor that it has been updated this also works with your curve points as well so if i go to edit creating each curve i can do the same thing by clicking or dragging or i can use the arrow keys for precise measurement movements we have updated some of our ad print options here so i'm going to demonstrate some of these updates if i go over to the add print button in my object browser right over here i can click this button and then it will take me to my window where i can select any artwork i have on my computer i'm going to use a png and as you can see now i have my png on top of my fabric this is my print and what we're going to go over is this repeat type when i hit this drop down menu you're going to see that there are some new repeat types there's the diamond x and y now i'm going to select each one so that you can see all of the differences between these another update that we did is the custom so what's nice about this custom is if i go to this drop down i'll then be able to customize my print repeat so i can play around with the space x and y and the shift x and y now this is going to be really nice because you're going to be able to make a lot of different variations really quickly and decide on the variation you like almost instantly so as you can see now i have this whole new variation but of course i could go in to any one of these little tabs and change it around if i wanted what's also really nice is my texture is getting updated as you can see this texture image is being updated instantly as i change everything around which is kind of on point we've also added this new feature open fabric selective so this is going to be really great because it's going to allow you to pick certain like texture maps and everything actually just maps from zfap files to bring in two other fabric files so i'm going to show you here i'm going to go to my object browser right click on top of the fabric and say open selective fabric i'll then be taken to my computer files and i can grab any z-fab file i want now this pop-up window is going to come up i can click select all and then all my fabric maps are going to be replaced or i can uncheck that and select certain fabric maps that i want so here i'm just going to replace the texture because i just want the print from this fabric in this new fabric i can also change the back and side of the fabric if i'd like as well the default will be open same as fun you also have the option to change out your physical properties we're not going to do that because we want this knit structure i'm then going to hit ok and you're going to see that now i have the print added in in a matter of seconds how cool is that so i can continue to use my uh texture editing tool and adjust this print around as i want as you can see and just continue to play around what's really nice is this tool also works with your colorway mode so this is going to be really helpful because now you're going to be able to add like heathers and stripes and prints to one whole project file really quickly and easily by just doing that right click open select file and then you're going to be able to select different fabric maps to adjust and play around with i'm not going to adjust the physical property yet because i'm going to show you something really important to just know right now but here i'll hit update and now i have a header with my print now what's important to know is all of my physical properties right now are following this knit fleece terry but if i go right click open select material and let's say i select this waffle and i hit open i'm going to use the same maps but i'm going to now bring in the physical property of the waffle what you'll see is now my physical properties change in this colorway however it's important to note that it also changes in the other color ways as well so when you adjust your physical property it affects all color ways not just the one you selected as of now but you can continue to go in and adjust different texture images and all of that just know that the physical property is the only thing that will affect all colorways at once but the textures will only affect that one colorway that you have selected as you can see again i'll uncheck the physical property and this speckle will just affect this one colorway not any of the others in 6.2 you can now removed link top stitching while keeping your pattern symmetric so this is going to be really great for pants i hope all of you are very excited about this i'm very excited about this um it's going to allow you to apply asymmetric top stitches while having symmetric patterns still so let's go through exactly how we can do this we'll already have our top stitching applied to our garment as you can see so i have these pair of jeans i've already got my top stitching and what i'm going to do is i'm going to go to my edit top stitching from there i can then select the top stitches in which i want to unlink so when i look at my two pant legs i don't want to see the top stitching of both sides so i'm going to go to my edit top stitches tool and i'm going to select one of my top stitching once i select that i can then right click i'll then see the option of remove linked editing here once i've removed the linked editing i can then easily select either top stitches and delete them by just either selecting it right clicking and hitting delete or just hitting delete on my keyboard and as you can see it's pretty great now i can have my top stitches on either side or just one side there is an important thing to know if i do bring this into another an older version of clo there won't be any topstitches then we have made a few updates in 6.2 pertaining to gene genologia previously when working in our uv editor mode you were unable to bake the puckering images you can only do the normal maps however with this update we now can bake the puckering images so if i jump into my puckering tab in my optic browser you'll see that i have a few puckering images applied to these jeans a little more than a few now if i go to my bake image in my uv editor i'm now able to bake this image all with the puckering combined another update we've done with genologia is with our multi-texture editor tool so if you go into your multi-texture editor tool here you now can bring in those genologia washes really quickly and easily as i just did here so i just brought in that wash for that one leg i can now use my wheel here to place and move this around as you may have remembered it was a little bit difficult to do this with just our graphics tool so we've made it a lot easier to do it here using our multi texture editor tool you can also use our blending modes with the multi-texture editor to blend it properly within the gene you can then go back to our uv editor however you will not be able to bake these textures due to the gene wash so as you can see the jean wash is applied throughout the pocket and even the leg but if i go into bake texture images i won't be able to so here i'll try to save it but a little pop-up will come up saying do the gene vial wash you're unable to we've also made some improvements to our nesting mode so we've updated our nesting mode a bit as you can see there are some new tools over on the right side one of the biggest updates we have done is we've improved our nesting algorithm to be more efficient and effective when you hit this play button the algorithm is now going to run now the longer you let it run the more effective and efficient your nesting will be i can continue to let this go all the way to 100 or i could hit this stop button and it will stop the moment i hit it as you can see now i have all my pattern pieces nested into my fabric rule if you go over here to this property editor you're going to see that it's populated with some new things and these are all your nesting settings right now so you can actually play around with this if you like before you even hit play by hitting this nesting settings tool so let's go through these options you have the number of garments you could either do current or grading i'm going to put total 3 for number of garments now you can also say if you'd like this to apply to all colorways or if you'd only like to apply it to certain colorways as well so this is good if you have like some engineered prints or um good two-way prints or anything like that because then you can select which colorways that this nesting should apply to here you can decide if you like to it to be one way or two way and you can also decide your buffering space now below we have some more information so you can decide the unit and what you want to see this information in we have a few options as you can see and now you'll see how much your fabric width and height is and then you're also going to see some more information about the nesting efficiency so the consumption and remnant fabric and also the area so where your fabric is placed you can change your fabric roll with by just clicking on the pattern and then you can change your fabric roll with and then you can jump back to settings or hit play and see how that nesting will be affected so let's hit play with all of these settings we've updated and the new fabric roll with and we're just going to let it load for a little bit to get a more efficient nesting algorithm and now i'm just going to hit stop and you'll now see my new nested garments with the three garments in total and you'll see the update in my consumption and remnant percentage which is really nice you can delete any extra garments so that'll be the other two garments that i added in i can delete those outlines and not see them any longer by hitting this delete button and i can also reset to my default arrangement if i wanted so here's that reset default arrangement that i can just select it is no longer in the right click it is here at this button right here i could go back to play if i wanted or i can also take a snapshot of this layout the snapshot works as it normally has where you have all of your original options and then you can just hit save if you'd like in 6.2 we have updated our review mode to include fitmaps along with rendering options for the avatar and some fabric map options this is going to give you all a lot more information when you're reviewing multiple sizes at once so all you'll have to do is pair all of your avatars and set all of this up over here in your grading once you've done that you can then go to your grade review mode now you'll see the new icons at the top here the first new icon is the fabric one you've got thick texture monochrome translucent and mesh let's jump to translucent so what's nice about having this translucent now with the multiple sizes is you'll be able to see just how close the body is at certain points and positions of your garment you can also jump between your fitmaps stress and strain and now the fabric is able to speak to you and tell you exactly how it feels and fits on each size which is what everyone wants and finally we've allowed you to play around with how you're viewing your avatar so you could do texture monochrome or mesh view the rest of the review window works exactly the same so you can still send out all of these images if you'd like or save them all individually in 6.2 we have improved our render window to now allow you to select certain colorways in which you would like to render out which i know a lot of you are going to be excited about i'm excited so here when i have my render window open and my i've selected my image i can now go over to colorway and there's this little tool right here which i can select button so once i select this button i'll now see all of the colorways and i can either select all or i can go through and select the certain colorways that i wish to render out once i have i can then just hit ok hit that stop button and then the play button and only the colorways which i have selected will then be rendered out what you're going to see in a matter of seconds because that's how fast our render window works and now you can see the three renders that i wanted in these three colorways thank you so much for watching this webinar i hope you enjoyed seeing some of the cool new updates that 6.2 has to offer along with some of the improvements we've made there are more in there which will follow with some more tips and tricks videos which will be released in on on youtube at a later date again if you have any questions please feel free to write them in the comment section and please remember to like and subscribe because we have so much great content here on youtube that will really help you out um our basics beginners training for one is one of my favorites thanks again you ",

        "Transcript": "hi everyone welcome to close 6.2 webinar here we're going through the new features that 6.2 has to offer we will start with our key features we have a new tool called the fill tool the fill tool will give you the ability to move accurately add a filter your quilted garment accessories and home goods this tool is located on your 2d tool bar we are starting with a vest that is already made and internal quilting lines have already been added by selecting the new fill tool we can select one or by holding shift we can select all pattern pieces for the corresponding lining and then release shift and place those new pattern pieces below my existing ones these new pattern pieces have a purple glow to let us know that the fill tool has been used there will be no pattern pieces for the internal fill but that can be accessed in our property editor later the existing internal lines have already been sewn together but we can always adjust delete or add additional lines later i'm quickly adding in new internal lines to the column once these lines are added we can return to the fill tool to select the newly added lines these internal lines are highlighted in purple and we now know that they have been activated and sewn together where the pocket bag is currently sewn onto the front of the vest the quilting function of the fill tool has not been activated the fill tool can be activated or deactivated with a simple click let's leave the pocket internal lines deactivated now that we have applied our fill we can start to adjust and customize our filling by using the fill tool to select the desired pattern piece and then looking to our property editor there are four types of fill type 75 duck 25 fill 90 tuck 10 fib 80 goes 20 feet 90 goes 10 feet once we have selected our desired fill type we can select the weight of the internal fill we can put the total weight of all the fill for multiple pattern pieces and chloe will divide the fill between those pattern pieces for example if i put 300 grams into my two front panels khloe will divide this to 150 on each side we can also put in the weight of the fill for a single pattern 300 grams for the back panel and 60 grams for the collar from there we can enter the quilting distance which will be the distance between the quilted internal lines the body of the west currently has quilting lines three inches apart which is why i am entering in three then selecting the collar separately since this pattern piece has quilting line 3 4 inches apart next to this there is a question mark symbol which has a full description of how this part of the tool works with all of that information added we can now simulate the garment in 3d and adjust as needed finally i am selecting a majority of my quilted pattern pieces using the fill tool to add one last detail we have the ability to turn on realistic quilting to add extra detail to our quilting lines if i check on the realistic quilting line it will give a much more realistic padding look i have left realistic quilting off on the column so we can then compare this both on and off it is recommended to add realistic quilting once you're finished with your garment let's review the full 3d garment tool it's options and a couple of best practices to help you succeed with folding we're going to fold this women's better and there is not an avatar in the project file there is also currently a low resolution garment we will first set up the garment so it is laying flat on the ground select all pattern pieces and rotate it parallel to the ground so we can lay it flat right click and choose move to ground center and simulate we can hide the 2d window as we are folding in the 3d window and view the garment from the top the full 3d garment tool is located in the 3d toolbar once selected you will see that a pop-up box will appear with multiple tools to use which we will go through right now the first tool is the rotate carbon tool which will rotate the garment around the x-axis next to that is the flip tool this will flip the garment over i'm going to use this tool so that we can fold the garment from the back and we should also simulate after to get the garment setup next tool will allow is to optimize the resolution for folding and these are the recommended default setting for folding your garment click ok to proceed if you see any wrinkles or areas of overlapping that you would like to get rid of you can then use the spreading tool this tool will spread out the garment and remove wrinkles similar to strength and function adjust the garment so the arms are straighter and the pieces are as flat as possible and make sure to simulate in between this option also adds stiffness to the garment and makes it easy for us to fold once our garment is all prepared we can now fold it for that we have fold tool this will allow us to fold the entire garment and is used when pattern pieces are not overlapping rotate your screen so the neck of the sweater is further away starting outside of the garment draw a line along the garment where you want to fold double click to finish and you will get a gizmo similar to the fold arrangement tool here you can select the outer arrow and rotate it up and over rest of the garment i'm going to then simulate and then stop next is fold selected tool this will allow you to select single or multiple pattern pieces to fold i want this arm to be folded under before i fold the other half of the garment with this tool you have to select the pattern pieces to be folded in this case i'm also selecting the cuff as it is attached to the sleeve once the pattern that you want to be folded are selected press return alt enter key on your keyboard starting outside of the pattern piece draw a line along the garment where you want to fold double click to finish and you will get that similar gizmo function rotate the outer arrow up and over the rest of the garment and stop as i start to simulate i will pull the cuff a bit downwards and fix the drape now we will go back and forth between the two fold tools to achieve the fold we want and of course we will be simulating in between to make sure the garment relaxes and drapes well we can now flip the garment back to the front to see what it looks like we are going to use the fold tool one more time to fold the cuff over the front once finished we can now use the high resolution garment tool to create a finish folded sweater in this version 6.2 a link function has been added that allows you to check and download digital contents uploaded from chloe to closet close 6.2 has a new tab in the library this tab is a space that links gazette space and contents for those who have not yet used the function this space will be shown as an empty space like the screen to link with closet you must first register your closet account here click on the closet account icon and click on add account button in the window that appears if you're signed in to closet your account is added to the library immediately otherwise sign in to closet and the web browser and add it to the library when closed account is displayed in the pop-up window of clone click on close button to close it the screen you see now is closet platform closet is a communication workspace that can store 3d content in the cloud and collaborate with members from the moment you upload the created 3d content to closet you can share ideas and make decisions while communicating in real time to make a database of data through closet let's briefly review the concept of a work room when you use closet for the first time or when you are invited to close it for the first time you can go through the closet sign-up process and check the dashboard of proset check the group you belong to first an individual can belong to many groups if you're invited to closet and signed up you can see a total of two groups the group you are the owner of and the group you are invited to brands can be added to each group seasons can be created within brands and work rooms can be created within seasons all 3d data and contents necessary for production and communication will be stored in this workroom 3d assets uploaded to workroom can be checked with a 3d viewer directly on the content page and detailed communication can be communicated and additional 3d work can be performed by appropriately granting each user style permission according to the situation of course it is good to download the file from closet somewhere on the individual pc and use it by loading it from chloe but with the new function of 6.2 this process can be performed more smoothly you can now select a group from the library depending on the group the folder that appears below is different closet workroom linked with close library is a favorite folder registered in account therefore to use workroom in close library register workroom as a favorite in closet platform when you click the refresh icon in the library the workrooms you have added to your favorites appear in the list you can check the digital contents in the workroom by double clicking the workroom in the list just like close basic library you can open the file and use it while checking the thumbnails of clothes fabrics and avatars when new files are added or excluded from workroom clo and closet are used by making the same environment by clicking the refresh icon in close library to link them as the frequency of encountering closet with this function increases in the future you will sometimes find questions about closet in that case please do not hesitate to contact us at hello closet.com the closet professional team will always respond sincerely you will now find the ability to export avatar as an fbx with or without the rigging data in the export settings you will find two new options export all and explode rig the first option export all will allow you to export the avatar fpx with the rigging data and skeleton if you choose exclude rig option you will be able to export the avatar fbx without the skeleton now let me import both file and show the result as you can see the first fbx we exported came in with the skeleton and the other one did not another development regarding fpx improvement is an additional option when importing fbx files we used to only be able to import fbx files as avatars in 6.2 we can also import fbx as a trim using this new drop down in the import settings we can use a glue button to attach it to the garments so we can also use the trim related settings that we could use before on objs and trim flats you can scale the trim change the weight in the property editor this also allows us to edit the colors and materials in the colorway mode another new feature is the ability to export colorway as multiple files here i've already set a few color way in the colorway mode for this particular style now we will go to the main menu of the file and select export as a gltf file in the pop-up window the details can be set as needed in the file bar check save color ways and then a selection box with combine to one file or multiple file option will appear if you want to combine all gltf file of the same color into one file for application you can select combine to one file if you want to save each gltf file of each colorway separately you can select multiple files to open the separate colorway gltf file go to file and import as gltf you can also change the object type to trim while importing this new feature is going to allow us to import gene file in the texture editor this denim garment already has some washing effects and puckering in a fabric property we have tile textures and under object browser we have the images for the puck ring we have placed on the garment earlier we were not able to bake the images of the puckering in uv editor mode now we have the ability to unify them and bake the puckering effect i have opened another file where the textures of the puckering are already unified from now on we can also unify gene files as well so we can open the texture editor under the texture tab on the property editor and open the unified texture we just did with our puckering baked as well i can then open a jean fan and place it on my garment as a graphic i'm using the gizmo on the corner to place it correctly i could also select a blending mode soft light is a blending mode that a designer uses to calculate the correct effect of the laser when we apply enclose we'll have both gene file and texture together under our texture tab before when we imported genologia file as graphics it was difficult to achieve the same region of graphic on the pocket but now it is very easy if i have pocket i can relocate it exactly on top of the graphic inside the uv editor and i can make sure i have the exact same fading on another hand if you try to bake this texture with genologia file we won't be able to and we will get this message instead the object display of light and wind controller has been changed in the previous version the controller object display appeared in a con shape so many users were confused about which direction the function was operated in the new version the controller object display has been changed to a more intuitive form making it easier to recognize and use the direction in which the function works in the toggle menu environment display click show light 3d and show wind controller view if you use the gizmo to adjust the direction of the light controller you can absorb how the shadow moves as the light is applied in the direction of the arrow again we will use the gizmo to adjust the direction of the wind controller activate it in the properties window and click the simulation tool you can see how the wind is applied in the direction of the arona in close 6.2 we have added in the ability to now replace patterns this will allow you to quickly and easily update patterns while keeping the arrangement sewing fabric and top stitching along with internal lines intact i will demonstrate this here i will bring in a new dxf pattern into my workspace you must make sure that you have the same amount of segment point for each pattern to properly replace it i can take my sleeve pattern and simply right click and copy and then move to my symmetrical sleeve select it right click and select replace pattern this will then replace both symmetrical pattern while keeping the internal lines graphics fabric texture and the properties along with the sewing relationship and arrangement what will be replaced are the point positions curves notches baselines pattern name and grading information which you will see in the body patterns when replacing half symmetrical patterns you will need to make sure that the replace patterns are also half symmetrical now when i replace these patterns you will see that the names are now updated along with the shape and curve of the pattern and baselines along with the grading information i can continue to adjust the style around and when finished i can simply simulate and i will have my updated style ready this feature will be very helpful for a multitude of things one example could simply be updating a popular style for a new season now you will be able to adjust the grading point of each size respectively first use the basic edit grading tool to check original grade offset in the property editor now you can use the new tool which is edit grading each to drag and change the grading point of each size go back to the basic edit grading tool and the offset value will change synchronically at the same concept the curve point of each graded size can be dragged and adjusted by edit curve grading each tool this feature will help you to change the grading point in a more convenient way next you will be able to adjust the ends of seam allowance in different width for that add seam allowance on the pattern using seam allowance tool go to property editor and change the type as point the segment will be highlighted as an arrow showing the start and end point you can adjust the width value in property editor to customize the seam elements in this version you will be able to offset internal line individually you can select a line or an internal line using edit pattern tool and right click and select offset as internal line in the pop-up you can change the number of offset more than one next you will be able to choose the distance as individual as a result you will be able to choose whether the offset is counted from previous line which is the adjacent line or select a line which is the original line that i had selected then you can enter the desired offset value and you will have individually offseted internal lines you will have the ability to maintain original curvature of pattern when using fullness point two a natural curve is applied by default when the pattern is cut you can keep the original curvature by pressing d key on your keyboard our add print feature has been updated in this new version here i'm going to go into my add print button and bring in a png print to place on top of my ground fabric once i select this button it will then take me to where all my files are in my computer and i can select the artwork i would like to add we have added in more repeat types now we have diamond option stripe x and stripe y axis options i'm going to select all so you can see the differences between them we have also included a custom repeat type when using this you can then go to the drop down arrow here and here you can place in different values for space shift x and y as you can see you can now create many different variations of print layouts quickly while your texture image is simultaneously being updated in 6.2 we have added in another way in which you can bring in fabric maps going into my object browser i can select one of my fabrics and right click in this drop down menu i then have the option of open select material once selected you will then be taken to your computer files and here you can select one of your zfab files once selected a pop-up box will appear this bopper box will allow you to select which map you would like to replace you either choose to select all or only replace certain maps i'm going to only replace the texture map for this fabric you can also adjust the back and side of the fabric as well the default will be open same material as front you will also have the option to replace the physical property of the fabric as well when you're all set you can then select ok and your fabric will be updated as you can see i have a new texture image i can continue to adjust and edit this texture around if i'd like this function will also work in color way mode so you can easily have multiple types of fabrics within one project file as you can see when i right click i will have this option in my menu here i will bring in a header i will not check on my physical property option because at this time it will affect all color ways i will demonstrate this in the next colorway going into my other colorway i will now bring in a waffle fabric and check on the physical property you can see that in my property editor it has been updated however my previous colorway have also been updated if i move into my other colorway that physical property will also be what the knit waffle is as well i can still continue to replace these texture images if i like but the physical property will remain the same of the waffle net as long as i do not select physical property in the next one in the new version we now have reflection channel infer material type to view the result we will first open the render window and activate the interactive rendering select the fabric fur and go to its property editor scroll towards the reflection channel below now if i increase the reflection intensity i can not only see the difference in 3d window now i can also see the difference in render window similarly if i decrease the reflection intensity the reflection will not be visible from this version it is possible to set the top scissor pattern differently while maintaining simultaneous editing function of the symmetric patterns example if the left and right patterns are the same but only the top stitch is set differently like a fly of a pants the symmetry pattern editing function had to be removed before but from this version different topstitch can be set on both sides while maintaining the symmetric pattern i will demonstrate this create all the top stitch you need to work on first then the top stitch of the fly part should be visible only on one side of the pattern so select edit topsish tool to remove the symmetry editing since the removal of symmetry editing of the top stitch must be set for each top stitch line if the top stitch to be removed is broken and there are multiple lines select multiple lines at once and if you right click on the selected top stitch you can select the remove linked editing menu if you select this menu you can now edit individually so you can delete unnecessary top stitches created on the opposite side of the pattern then as you can see you can set the top stitch differently while maintaining simultaneous edit function of the symmetric pattern another great resource added to close 6.2 is the y-caker global color palette if you open your color window you will see in addition to your pantone color library you also have a new tab for the ykk colors if the tab is not automatically visible in your color window you can add it manually from your program files you can go to cloud network online authorization select preset in that select palette and you will be able to find ykk globalcolors.cc05 with this new feature your avatars can be saved as encrypted avatar files open any avatar in cloud and click on file save as avatar and choose encrypted avatar file format from the drop down and save once you change the file format to encrypted avatar or avte file the avatar cannot be further exported as another 3d file like fbx or obj you can click on the file open avatar to load the avte file to the cloud window now let me export this avatar as an obj i will now try to import the obj back to flow a fail to load error message will pop up and object data will also be missing now let's try fpx file click on file export fbx then try to import the same back in chloe it will also fail to load in addition to this an avtu file can also be saved as an avt or avatar file even if you try to save it as a avt file it will still get saved as avte file format that is encrypted file format in close 6.2 we have made some updates in our print layout and nesting algorithms you can see off to the side we have a few new tools that will help you to attain a more efficient pattern list the first tool we will cover is the plain nesting tool this tool will use the updated algorithm to nest your patterns the longer you let this load the more efficient the algorithm will be however you can select this top nesting tool at any time to finish the nesting once you hit stop you will then see that your property editor has populated with new information this is your nesting setting options you can get to this option by also selecting the nesting setting button here you have a few different settings to choose from the first option here is the number of garments you can select current or grading you can then select the total amount of the comment you would like to see you can also decide if you like any other color ways to follow these nesting settings you can either choose the current colorway all colorways or custom with custom you can then use this button off to the right to then choose which colorways you would like to follow these settings we also have provided crane direction options with one way or two way you also can input your buffering space for your patent pieces as well further down you have information here you can choose which unit you would like to see this information in depending on the unit type you are most familiar with you can then see the fabric width and height for that nested area along with the efficiency of the consumption and remnant fabric and finally you can see the pattern area if you like to adjust your fabric roll with you still can simply select the pattern piece and you will then see your property editor change and here you can change your fabric roll width we can now go back to our nesting play button and see if our pattern's nest changes with these different settings and fabric role again the longer you let this load the more efficient the algorithm will be another tool that you can use is this remove additional nesting pattern pieces if selected it will then remove these outline patterns and then show you one set of the pattern pieces we also have a reset default nesting tool which will then reset the nesting tool before you inputted the nesting settings finally we also have the snapshot tool which will allow you to take a snapshot of your nested pattern on the fabric rule the pop-up options for the snapshot have not changed you can now save snapshots of your colorway as a pdf after you design all colors in the colorway editor click on the button save image on the upper left corner select colorway editor from the pop-up window in this new version pdf file format have been added to the save option below now you will be able to move in quadrant unit to ensure that the original texture pattern is maintained when moving uv across quadrants after completing the 3d production switch to the uv editor mode now you can see that the menu options on the right have two more new functions select the third option move uv enter movement distance 1 in the pop-up window to move a quadrant distance and so on then press the arrow key to move the uv to complete another improvement is the automated and fast uv centralized arrangement you can see that the menu options on the right have another new function uv arrangement once you click on it automated and a fast uv centralized arrangement is complete let me share some updates related to the review mode in the past to switch to review mode you had to match the avatar by grading size simulate the garment on the avatar and then click on save 3d state button to manually save the simulation state however starting with this version if you match the avatar by grading size and simulate the clothes on the avatar the final simulation state is automatically saved in the review mode in addition in order to modify the simulation state of a specific size while using the review mode in the pass it was necessary to select a specific size to be modified in the simulation mode and then simulate again from the beginning so partial correction in the last state was not possible but now since this version has been improved the simulated state is maintained even if you return to the simulation mode from the review mode you can edit only the parts you want to edit in the review mode also the last state simulated is applied directly to review mode unfortunately as this feature was developed review mode data created in versions prior to 6.2 could not be maintained however the information matched with the avatar remains as it is so you only need to reapply the simulation for each size once a size set status is saved in review mode it can be changed into different texture display mode for clear understanding you meanwhile the size set in review mode can be shown by stress nap and strain map for better comparison you can also change the display mode of avatar if needed from now on you can set a default mode in cloud simulation mode was the default in the previous versions but with the latest update you can change it according to your preference to any of the below modes for this you can open the user settings from the user interface you can set the default mode as simulation animation colorway modular uv editor or bom let me set the modular mode as default and close the window and any time you open a new instance clove will launch in your preferred mode in 6.2 we have improved our rendering window to now allow you to choose which colorways you would like to render out by going to this button off to the right here you will be able to select which colorway you would like to render out once selected a pop-up box will appear here and you can choose the color way you can either select all or select just a few once selected click ok now you can render out images by selecting stop render and final render button and as you can see below i now only have two images to render out once finished i will then be able to review my renderings we hope you enjoyed the webinar and learned a lot of great things thank you so much for watching you ",
