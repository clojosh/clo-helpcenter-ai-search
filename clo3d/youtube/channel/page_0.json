        "Transcript": "hello everyone since CL version 20 24.2 is now available I thought we'd take a little time and look at the updates to the UI just so that we can all be on the same page the toggle menus have been organized and each section now has its own own designation to describe what is coming underneath overall the icons for the tools and in the tabs and such have been updated with more contrast to make things easier to see all the tool icons are in the same place and though visually things are changing Clos core tools and functions are all completely the same let's go back here is the version 7 workspace note the menus the drop- down area here and this left sidebar in the sidebar at this point there are two modular libraries the original modular library was paired with modular from the dropdown here for creating modular blocks the new modular Library combines these two processes in 2024 here the original modular library is removed as is the modular from the drop-down menu here version 7.3 introduced the editor menu which which contained these options further reducing the modes available here in the drop-down menu at this point the menus are very similar to those in Clove versions five and six in version 2024 the menus have been reorganized note where some things are now the 2D menu not only includes parametric pattern here the sewing menu has been removed and sewing is now here at the bottom of the 2D menu the production menu has now been added removing the editor menu and this houses colorway bill of materials and the grading review connect and closet are no longer in the menu bar in the upper right hand size but have their own menus the display and preferences menus have been removed and those options are now part of the settings menu here plugins now have their own menu this is helpful because of the new Unreal plugin that is currently available we have also added our AI chatbot to The Help menu to make things easier for you so that you can get help the upper right hand corner is now simpler with only five items left in the mode dropdown and at the moment only your username is next to it the biggest visual change is the introduction of our new library currently this is something that is in beta and you can try it out when you open version 2024 for the first first time the original library is there but note what you have at the bottom leftand corner you can switch to the new library when you click it this window opens and you can choose learn more this will send you to our online manual so you can learn more about how to use this Library once you proceed into the new library note the icon that is now added into your upper right hand corner you can click this to show and hide it or you can still use the y key to show and hide the library in the home area you have all the clo installed assets just like the original Library you can change the view options as always and you can see the texture of things or previews of other options if you turn on this little I dot here under the Community assets is everything available at the connect Marketplace your personal items that you have already purchased are located here when you click this button at the bottom left to the the right of the library search you have the account information and this little icon here is a link to send you to the connect Marketplace online in your browser this plus icon allows you to create your own libraries this is like adding multiple folders in the original library but now this plus sign allows you to create individual tabs for different libraries we encourage you to fully explore the new library but if you prefer you can go back to the original Library by clicking this icon in the lower leftand corner of the new library window we hope you'll love our new user interface as much as we do thank you ",

        "Transcript": "hey all you clovers it's Phoebe here and we are going to do a deep dive into colorway and also talk about some great updates we've done along the way heads up this is a long video so buckle in but let's Jump On In and have some fun while we learn okay so I have my closed screen open and as you can see I have my bag here let's start with the foundations okay so first off where is colorway colorway is underneath production at my top toolbar here I'll see production I can select that and colorway will be right there great right now going with the foundation theme let's talk about what we're looking at right now so at the very top here right here we've got update now what update is going to do is it's going to refresh your thumb nail image right here it's going to keep refreshing that based off of what's in your 3D window here okay I'm highlighting a lot of things at once next we have save image now save image is really great and super helpful for when you're exporting and ready to share all of your colorways so we're going to go through that in the end but we have save image right next to update after that we have show hidden graphic now this is not checked on so what that means is I'm just going to show it to you if I decide to hide this that means you would not see it but if I checked it on then you would see it okay because you're checking on to show the hidden graphic if you don't want to like see your hidden Graphics then it should be unchecked but if you want to see them then you can check them on and I'm going to now show this so no matter what I'll always see it but now we have show hidden graphic right here right next to show hidden graphic we have the new update where there's it's not super new but it's newish there's two little add buttons the first add button is the simple way to add which I am certain 90% of you will only ever need I will get into y later and then this second add button here is the more advanced way to add which if you are like I'm going to do all the things then that is your tool that is your ad okay but again 90% of you will only need the simple way that 10% which we knew needed a little bit more of an advanced way we now have for you so that's great right at the bottom here we have our zooming so you can zoom in and out so for those of you who really like a big font on your iPhone this is amazing for those of you who are a little bit like me who likes to play Life in a medium scale then medium is your place to go and then finally we have this edit and view option so what does edit mean edit means you can view all of the components of your colorway all right here and you can edit and adjust them view means you'll just view that colorway image so you'll just view that thumbnail which reminder you can update using that update tool right here update little button so if I click this it will update it based off of how I'm viewing my 3D window so every time I rotate and move it I can hit this update and it will update and that is the layout so I always like to have edit on because I'm normally editing my colorway so before we even start about adding in colorways I want us to just remind ourselves what is Fabric and Clow like what does a zfab file or a fabric file consists of and there are three separate parts of a Zab file okay three very important your first part is the information now this holds all of that really really really important stuff especially for b or bill of materials so it holds like what the name of the fabric is what the content of the fabric is the item number of of the fabric the supplier of the fabric the owner of the fabric these are all really crucial parts of the fabric that you need to know especially if you want to order it so that's why this is all really important to have the next part of this is the materials part now the materials part is the visual part of it all and this is also really really important and it's really important especially for me making it look how you envision it to so what that means is it has all your Maps so it's this part right here and it even goes a little bit further down but it holds your texture map so if you have a print or something on it it holds that it's your normal map so it's like the weave or the knit of your fabric that holds that it's the displacement map so if there's any bumps or like highs and lows it holds that the opacity so if it's slightly opaque in certain places or transparent in other places like a lace opacity map if it has some reflection or some light to it so if it's iridescent or there is like some shine to it those are your reflection and metalness maps all of your maps and how the fabric looks that's where all of this is now the materials is kind of what you play around with the most especially when you're doing colorways so this is a really important part with colorways and the last part is your physical properties physical properties is like how do I say this it's it's the core data it is what it's how the fabric drapes it's the essence of it almost it is the information that you gave it when you were testing all of that fabric it shows you how it's going to look in the digital world and it's supposed to replicate it exactly the same of the physical so if it's going to drap far away from the body if it's going to be really close if it will um like balloon out how it will stretch and all of that that is in the physical property information and most of the time that is not adjusted in colorways because most of the time you're just making different skews which means just different colors of the same fabric there are some instances where you would need technically a different fabric alog together and for those instances we created an advanced version of adding in colorways but that's why I said 9 90% of you are only ever going to need to use the simple way because there's very few instances where you need a completely different fabric or a color one and those are the three different sections that make up one Zab so those are the three sections that make up one Zab now you might be asking me you might be like Phoebe you're really harping on this and like can you learn to be Cho the answer is no I cannot but the reason why I'm harping on it is because for the advanced version of adding in Fabrics it has everything to do with how much you can and can't change based off of what's in your property editor so I really wanted you to understand how a fabric is created how Zab is made up so that you kind of understand understand what these different options are especially in the advanced model now that I feel like you all understand we can move on to more fun things so another refresher course how to add in Fabrics into your object browser or just like add in Fabrics just because if you're someone like me you probably like to prep if you're not someone like me you still should know this okay and maybe you should start to prep it's fun it's nice it gets your life like very ready okay I'm just saying it's nice first off we have folders here so you can edit names and create folders I'm going to say like um outer shell bag and now I'm going to add in another folder and say lining bag and yeah yeah I did do a capital I okay lining gu and I'm going to just drag this into my lining along with my tag and great now I'm nice and organized I'm a big organization fan now what I can do is I can add in a default fabric now when you add in a default fabric you have a bunch of options available to you you could rightclick and fabric Creator and then use the fabric creator and start to add in now I have a whole another Fabric and I can play around with that information denim denim okay one way to add in a fabric completely legitimate it's great it's really it's really helpful another way to add in a fabric is you could select a fabric and bring in a completely new fabric by using this open like icon right here so this folder icon I can open this it'll bring you directly into your computer files and then you can bring in a fabric that you want to use ex so okay I'm going to show you this third way and here's the thing this third way I think is really great some might even call it the bomb diggity okay I'm just going to be honest I think it is the bomb diggity I think it's kind of one of the best ways because like the options that it gives you you can rightclick and you can say open select material okay this is the really cool feature I really think it's underused and I want so many more people to use it so please use this I didn't even develop it but like I think it's great it's so great you rightclick okay open select material when you open select material it again brings you to your computer files anywhere that you have access to you can select it you can then let's say I want the corset and I hit open now let's say I selected the corset because I knew the print in it and I loved it and I wanted wanted to use that exact same print in this F like fabric so that's why I wanted it so I could uncheck all of this and just bring in the texture I could also do the back and change this and I could say like oh I just wanted like nothing like I just wanted the color of the back and same with the side I could say like I just wanted the color of the side and I could bring all of this in you have the option of bringing everything about that fabric in or like one thing about that that fabric in and if you want to you could just hit cancel and bring nothing of that fabric in like the options you have are amazing it's so vast and it's great and it I just it can solve so many workflows and so many requests I think just try it please um so I'm going to bring in the texture and not the physical property and I'm going to hit okay and now I brought brought in this texture and I also brought in the type so the original type was a knit but now it's a fabric velvet and I just brought in the texture it's base color it's this one and everything it didn't adjust my presets or anything like that it's just brought in the texture of me for me and all of that it even kept the same name as originally and and everything so it's really really helpful it's really really great and I really really like it because let's say for a lining I was like oh I really like like this stripe texture and I could right click and say open select material and for my back side I'm going to uncheck and say texture and undo color and for my front I'm going to say texture and I'm going to hit okay and now I made sure that my back has the same as my front and like this this is the texture and everything and you can like add all of this in this is really really great for if you're doing glbs if you're doing just like zabs it's really really helpful so open select is one of my favorite features really try it it can answer a lot of your workflow needs I think especially when it comes to colorways and all of that I'm going to go back to my history tab here and just jump back a little bit more just so that I can go back to my original of course contrl z does the same thing but okay and also now that I've shown you all the ways in which you can add in a fabric we all know the classic way which is just double clicking on our Fabric and it will bring it right back in to our object browser from our library which is a very classic way but what if you have all of the these Fabrics that you don't really want in your workspace because they're unused and if some of you are asking me Phoebe how do I know if they're unused or not that is a great question if I go over here you can see in my object browser there are certain Fabrics that are grayed out like the words are grayed out that's telling me that they are not active in my like current in any colorway that I have I also see that there's a trash can next to it that's also telling me that it is not active in any of the colorways that I have so what I can do is I can just select it rightclick and delete all unused fabrics and it will delete them all so a really really helpful thing okay I'm going to hit this update because again it's going to update my thumbnail to be what I'm seeing here in my 3D window and now that we have gone through congratulations you have made it we have gone through all of the foundations that I wanted us to remember and the refreshers that I wanted us to have and thank you for listening to my TED talk about open select I just think it's really important and I love it so use it now let's go into how do you add in a color way well we're going to of course start with what I think 90% of you are going to be using which is the simple ad so here I'm going to add in two different colorways and I'm going to also rename them I want you to know the amount of anxiety that goes through me whenever I like write anything in real time in front of you is shocking just because I'm such a bad speller but like nobody's perfect okay so here I have two simple ads I just hit add and add this little button right here let's go through all the things you can do with just a very simple easy ad so let me select my knit here I can go in and change the color great looks great right I can hit control and I can select multiple things at once allowing me to then change the color all at once which is nice I could go into this one or I could go into here in my object browser and I can go to my side and I can change this to be darker I could even go into my graphic here and I can change this out to being a different graphic so let's say I wanted this one and then I wanted to resize it because I do I can even change out this graphic for and then I'll hit update and see what my update is really nice I can then go into this simple ad and let's say for this one I wanted to get rid of the texture right and I can delete this then I can go in and change out my colors wow this is really looking like fall I can also go into here so there's quite a few I like there's quite a few things I can do with just this simple ad I can change out every single material property I see here just know okay if you're in knit and you're in like knitwear you can't change the stitching or like the knitwear information you can change the coloring but you can't change like the we stuff okay just like you can't change the stitching the yarn thickness gauge or nit Direction because technically if you change any of that that is actually changing the physical properties of it and with this symbol ad it's mainly just about changing the visualization not so much the physical so if you are changing the Stitch type and like the gauge or yarn thickness that's changing the physical aspects of it so you can't do it if you change one you'll change them all and just like so you know especially the visualization here you'll you'll visually see the change here so everything you can do with this simple ad you can change every single material map so that means you can adjust and edit textures meaning you can add in a print you can take out a print you can change how the print looks you can change out all of the colors you can add and change you can like add and change the scaling of a normal map you can bring in a different texture of a graphic um you can change out the sides of a fabric in a different color way there's a lot of different things that you can do to adjust a color way within just a simple ad like this then next option we have is an advanced ad okay so that is when you're like okay but I want to be able to change more or you want more control over what you're changing or anything like that so here in this add as custom setting when I select this I now see a popup and what this is going to do is this is going to say like okay what parts of your fabric properties do you want to edit we have materials materials is your simple ad okay it is all of this the whole material section see materials see materials these are the same name for a reason okay same name for a reason materials goes with materials so all of your materials can be edited independently from other colorways so colorway dour colorway materials can be edited independently from simple ad material from symbol ad colorway and the materials in symbol ad colorway can be edited independently from symbol ad 2 colorway and default colorway so it can all be adjusted independently from the other colorways if you need more options then all properties is for you all properties means that everything in this property editor is adjustable to you everything the light touches is yours okay so everything within the property editor is adjustable so all of your like information all of your materials all of your physical properties those all be adjusted independently from the other colorways meaning what you do to one colorway will not affect the others the physical properties if you adjust one like this colorways physical properties it will not affect the others if you adjust that colorways materials it will not affect the others if you adjust that colorways information it will not affect the others all of that will be on its own it is basically creating its own like little colorway that is independent from the rest and then finally we have the link option the link option actually does the exact opposite of what all properties does it is going to link every every color way that you like that you selected to the next one that you just added so I selected simple add to right so if I hit link the next color way I add will link to simple add two it will not link to the other ones it will just link to simple add two so whatever I do to that color way will affect the the simple add to color way okay what I do to one will affect the other the complete opposite of all properties now what's nice here is when you hover over there will be a reminder of what all of these do so there's something to help you out you go to this eye icon it will also tell you what all of these do and you can go to the manual to remind you what's also really nice is you can change these via section so I can say like all properties for every section and hit add but what I can also do is I can change this per component so each component I could say like actually I just want this like this tag fabric to be linked and I want this logo like this CL logo to be linked and I want these top stitches to be linked so you can decide based off the individual component along with the entire section which is really nice and now I'm going to hit add and close and just to help us all out in remembering what we've all done linked is it's linked is most of the Fabrics are actually properties are actually materials ads uh and then the graphic and um the top Stitch and the tag are all linked now you might say like how Phoebe like how could I remember that so if I go into here you can see actually there's little symbols here that tell me what's linked and it will even show me what it's linked too so you see how it's linked to here so it will tell me if something is linked together now you might be asking well Phoebe how do I know if something's like an all properties are independent from one another we also have a way to tell you that so over here in our property editor there's this these little like boxes these will help show you which colorways this fabric is going to affect so right now you can see that this fabric only affects this one color way because this is the only color way that you can see and all the other colorways are in not use so if I hover over here you can see not used not used not used but if I hover over this one it shows me it's used in all properties if I select simple add two and again like I'll zoom in here it shows me that it's used in everything but this one color way right cuz this is the one that's crossed out so it shows me all of my little swatches like it shows me little tiny images of which colorways it's in and if I hover over it it even shows me now if you're like this is too much you can always click this little color like this little droplet and it will hide it if you want to see it you can click it again to see so you can always hide and show if you want to see all of your Fabrics in all of the colorways you can just hit this like top two droplets and it will show you all of the Fabrics in all of your colorways you can also hide it if you don't want to see it all and then you can of course like go back so that you can see your little swatches and everything now let's go into all of the things all properties can do for you so all properties gives you kind of like free range into all of the editing that you can possibly do here it's a little bit like the wild west for you Americans I don't know what the equivalent is for anywhere else in know the world I apologize but it is very much a freefor all meaning every part of your fabric you can adjust so here I have my knit so if I decided that I actually wanted to have this a seed and I was like oh I want this to be one and I'm going to have this be like eight I could do that and I can hit update and it won't affect my other colorways because this is in all properties so I can go to like the simple ad and I can then see the knit and it's the same and it's this one if I went to my all properties completely different I could also go and I could say like oh I'm going to open up and bring in my colorway too completely different fabric and as you can see I brought in my colorway 2 bag colorway 2 so here it is in my colorway bag colorway 2 and you can see that my other colorways the name hasn't changed nothing's changed just this name and everything also you can see that my materials have changed all of these materials have changed my preset I can change this preset too I could say like I wanted a cuton so we just going to go for it py here I changed this if I go to this color way it's the exact same how this color way right this these properties these physical properties have not changed based off of what this physical property is which is the NIT Ponty so I can change this completely based off of whatever I want I could even go in and let's say I was like oh I want to do an add print I could add another print I can go into my fabrics and all of this I could even be like I actually wanted I could decide actually no I don't want this ad print I could say I wanted the ad print in the lining and I could again like go in maybe I want to change this color a little bit more and now I have a whole new lining and if I hit update and again it doesn't affect any of my other Linings just this one and I completely added an ad print so the things that you can do here I could also go in and I could change I could add in a whole another graphic so I could add a graphic here so let's say for this one I could maybe add another all properties because I can say okay I wanted another all properties here and for this one I want a completely different fabric so I'm going to hit open and I'm going to say this is going to be this one completely different fabric I want a completely different lining I don't want to print I deleted that I'm going to go and say this B this color applying clothes again I'm going to hit update doesn't affect anything in any of the other Co colorway I literally deleted a whole section of a fabric and it did not affect anything I can then say okay for this one I also wanted to go into the graphics and you know add in a clo graphic right here I can do that and then I can like change out the color to be this and go into my Fabrics here and change the out what I'm getting at is there's really nothing that you can't change when you when it comes to all properties on its own it will not affect any other color way so you can honestly make a completely different garment or bag or whatever in one color way if you really wanted to it's all on however you wanted this workflow to work just know one thing and this is the one thing I am going to give you a heads up on if I decided to simulate with this it's going to look very different see I simulated it looks very different and if I hit update it will update based off of this simulation in all of the colorways so all of the colorways will then look like this which may not be what you want right you might say like well but this one if I hit simulate is different right like this is different properties this fabric is very different from what the other one is just know that the thumbnail here is going to reflect whatever in that 3D window on all colorways not just like one in spe one specifically so if I hit update now it will update all of them to this just fun facts now let's get into the linked cuz we talked a lot about the all properties and the all properties just really cool I think like you can see the added bonus of being able to do all the things you can do here with the linked this is also really cool because as you can see this graphic is linked between this one and this color way so whatever I do to this let's say I decide to change this to be this color apply and close update it will change to both because it's linked so this color way and this color way are adjusted if I see both of these let me slide this over just so you can see this a little better so these are linked together if I change this thread color to being pink it will change on both so this one and this one both of them are going to change to being pink if I change this fabric to being red both are going to be red so anything I do to one colorway will automatically happen to the other every time when they're linked now you might be asking me a few things you might say Okay Pho can I unlink them yes all you have to do is select the graphic or whichever rightclick and you can say actually I just want this to be materials or I want this to be all properties I'm going to say materials this will unlink it this will make it so I could go back and say actually no or maybe I wanted it black and it will just change one of them well this one's still blue this one's black you know you might also be asking me okay well actually I wanted this graphic to be the same everywhere like linked on all of them you can do that too so let me just select this I can actually let me select this one I can copy it and I can change out the color let me say this applying close and I can drag this over now this is important this is a really really cool Fe part of this tool so it's really nice when I drag this in you're going to see some text next to my cursor it says assigned to current colorway only press control to change how an item is assigned to colorway I'm going to press control now it's going to say assign to All colorways by unlinking materials that means basically all properties I'm going to hit control again assigned to all color Ways by linking all properties this is what I want I want this graphic to be linked throughout all colorways so now I'm going to drag and drop and this is going to be linked throughout all colorways as you can see this is now linked all throughout I can go in here resize and it's going to be edited throughout I could also go into this tag in my fabric here and do the same thing for the fabric so let's see say I wanted this fabric tag to be the same throughout I can hit control control linking and drag and drop it will link throughout all the other colorways and keep it all linked so whatever happens to one will happen to the other so you can easily link them you can easily unlink them so I can of course go to the this like Fab this top Stitch right click and again unlink them and just dragging and dropping it and selecting which way you want to add it will unlink link it let's say for this color way the linked is color way for this one I wanted to go more reddish let's say for this lining I wanted it to be a little bit different this is when the open select is really helpful just sorry I couldn't help it open select is great so if I right click and I say open select I could select this stripe here the one that I showed you before and hit okay and then here we go all set and this doesn't affect the other colorways just like in fact cool right just like I couldn't help it okay I just had to show you it I tried really hard the whole the whole time to not but just just so remind even with an ad as materials you can of course use the open select and then change out the different like texture or anything like that because that's really helpful so you can do all of that with the right click open select and then bring in different parts of different Fabrics in to create like the update fabric that you want these are all very standard ways in which to add and adjust and edit we kind of talked a little bit about the dragging and dropping that I just showed you especially for here let me bring in add a fabric open so you have some options when you drag and drop one of the options you can do is if I dragged and drop if I select this drag it says assigned to current colorway only this will make it so only this color way is affected even if this is linked so I'm going to drag and drop this other fabric here this is only going to apply to this colorway I can also drag and drop this here only going to apply to this color way and this is a great way in which you can create color blocked colorways without having to create a whole another Style so here I just dragged and dropped this on a different pattern and it only applied to this color way I can update I could also go in and change this so that it's like red and it matches this color way and you can see it doesn't affect any of the other colorways and now I just did a whole color block for this one because I just changed this inside part I could also do it here for the pocket so let's say for this lining I again assigned to current colorway only or I'm going to say assigned to All colorways by unlinking materials so for the all the colorways I'm going to make it so the pocket is a different fabric and I'm dropping this in and now if I update all the colorways are going to have a different fabric for the pop for the pocket my pocket is a different fabric property it's a different fabric than the lining and I've updated it all all through dragging and dropping so this dragging and dropping has a lot of power behind it you can like drag and drop you can select this drag and drop and next to your cursor you can decide if you only want to apply it to the current color way meaning just this color way will be affected if you hit control then you can assign it to all your colorways making it so all the colorways will be affected but you can just adjust the material ears and everything or you can make it so all the colorways are affected and everything's linked which is what I did with the tagging so I did this one for the pocket to make it so that it applied to all colorways but I was able to change the color for them and this one I did for just the interior of the um bag here because I just wanted to color block that one color way so it all depends on what you want and how you want that one color way to be adjusted and it's really really cool let's say though you don't want to actually see the graphic in all of your colorways you can select your graphic here right click and say hide other Graphics this will hide it in all other colorways and you will just see it in this one quick and easy   so now I've got quite a lot of colorways before we move on to the next step I just want to do a brief overview of what we just covered what we just covered are the two different ways in which you can add in colorways you have the simple way which basically means you're bringing in a color way and just being able to adjust all of the visual ual or material properties of that colorway the textures and all of the colors can be adjusted independently from one another colorway the other way in which you can add in colorways is a more advanced version and that will allow you to choose if you want every single property of that colorway to be able to be adjusted independently from the other colorways or if you want every single part of that property to be linked to your previous colorway or the color way that you selected meaning whatever you adjust to one will affect the other one that's linked we also went through all the different parts that can be adjusted when you do all properties when you do adjust materials and when you do link you can adjust your fabric maps all of your material Maps meaning your base map colors um normal Maps de saturation Maps opacity maps metalness maps all of those can be adjusted with materials all of those can be adjusted with property editor Al with all properties along with your information and your physical along with being able to add in uh ad prints as well you can also change out different graphic sizes when you do all properties versus when you just do materials you can hide multiple Graphics all at once by right clicking and saying hide all Graphics that's for everything um you are able to relink fabrics and you can unlink Fabrics by right clicking on your Fabric and being able to relink and being able to unlink by either selecting materials or all properties you can relink by dragging and dropping your Fabric in to your 3D workspace and using your control you can flip through your different options of dragging and dropping it so that it is all all colorways with unlined materials just the current colorway or all colorways and linking materials so that's all your options for dragging and dropping both for fabrics and for graphics and even for top stitches and that is everything we just covered I'm sure you're like w that was way too much and it was so much that we just did but it was a lot of great information and rewatch this a lot of times the next part that I just wanted to show you all is once you have created all of your colorways you can then go into this save image option right here and hit save image this will then let you decide if you want to use your 3D window or colorway editor pick your 3D window I'm going to hit then okay and then I'm going to hit o um and now you have a snapshot line sheet you can decide how many view counts you want so if you want to do a front and back view if you want to do like a front back side if you want to do a front back side 3/4 like you have up to four different view counts I'm just going to do two you also can then decide if you want the layout to be vertical or side by side I like side by side you can also decide which colorways you want to see which ones you don't I'm going to keep all of them if you don't want one you can always just uncheck you can say save as separate images or and transparent background or you can save them all together you also have control over your sizing and all of that and then I'm going to hit and I'm also going to save colorway group that's always really nice and now I'm going to hit save and what that has done is it now just saved one whole line like line up lineup of all of my colorways all together I also then can see each one individually in each like View and I can see them together as well like so thank you so much for watching I know it was such a long video congrats for making it all the way way if you have any questions please check out the comment section below don't forget to like And subscribe we've got so much great content for you and thank you again so much for watching this whole video it means so much to me it means so much to the whole CL team and keep having fun in CL I hope this helped and thank you again ",

        "Transcript": "hi my name is Jim your clo instructor CL is used by industry professionals to create and develop garments while reducing waste and shortening the Prototype life cycle many of our Enterprise clients worldwide have achieved this goal already as with many creative tools clo can be adapted Beyond its initial purpose our clients are expanding into other categories including accessories home and Outdoor Products some clients train their employees to use CL in specific ways larger companies train separate groups of users for things such as technical design and pattern making garment design marketing and e-commerce now that CL is deeply ingrained in the industry learning institutions have been asking how to expand how CL is taught specifically universities have inquired about using CL in product development and Merchandising courses the CL ecosystem in this example I will show you how to use three of our products to teach non-designer students how to expand their toolbox and prepare them to enter their industry first is in inspiration closet is our online sharing communication and collaboration platform here you can set up your own company and brand and add in various Seasons lines workrooms and assortments as is the case with any set of designed garments there is a presentation to convey your vision We Begin here with the visual board our example brand Dominus is a men's e Leisure wear here we have a board that conveys the feel of our vision with garments and Life Style next we have developed a color palette that will be used throughout the line the connect Marketplace is a great place to find assets to start with completed blocks can be curated for a cohesive fashion collection we have reviewed all the connect men's blocks and chosen these nine to work with although CL has an extensive Library Fabrics there are nearly 1,500 free Fabrics that can be used as well a vast collection of buttons trims and top stitches can be used to complete each garment this collection is made up of options from within CL and from connect next using CL the goal here is to introduce users to to Clow without having to worry about them knowing pattern making or sewing the product development and merchandizing workflow would begin with adding an avatar or mannequin and then bringing in a garment these garments are already fully constructed the more experienced user can make edits or begin adding and editing various parts of the Garment such as Fabrics closures and trims the ability to drag and drop in clo makes it easy to add prints to the fabrics and graphics for creating labels and tags this workflow does not require indepth instruction from CL these students or users would be encouraged to explore on their own if they want to learn about design techniques or editing of garments the training of the instructor and then the student would be limited to how to import and apply assets sets create colorways and save output snapshots turntables or renders the colorway editor can help show the range of option for an entire line by using print layout CL will help optimize the pattern layout so that the bill of materials will accurately reflect the true cost of the garments once your garment is fully realized with Color Prints labels trims seam allowances points of measures and you've filled out your bill of materials you can add it to your close set workspace within closet you can then edit the information area which includes the workflow category tags and description you can also view an online tech pack that includes important design construction and delivery dates as well as full cost estimation in addition to the bill of materials the cost estimation includes but it's not limited to labor packaging and transportation there is also an option to download an Excel Tech pack as well depending on the permissions you set when sharing your work you can get input from the viewer and share files and links related to your garment now presentation and visualization once the line is complete and you have created output via CL or Clos set you can fill out your visual board and include renders turntables and a link to your showroom there is an option to save the whole presentation as a PDF so you can share that in CL options such as hangers to replace the Avatar and the use of the Garment folding tool to set up stacks of garments for retail display you can also import or construct display objects to create retail displays clo can render a panoramic image that can be used in the closet virtual showroom in closet if we make an assortment of our garments we can do several things line sheets both a virtual and Excel sheet download option to see all the Garment colorways and information mix and match a Fe feat that allows you to play around with your garments by coordinating them as a top and a bottom you can easily mix and match 3D items in real time communicate with your partners share ideas and make final outfit decisions the virtual showroom an interactive site that will allow the viewer to view your garments implementation whether your school currently has CL licenses or not should you decide that this is something you would like to implement please feel free to reach out to your CL contact or via the contact page on our website we will gladly set up a meeting to discuss how best to move forward I leave you with one of the CL mission statements have fun building have fun learning ",

        "Transcript": "hey all you clovers it's Phoebe and we have some really exciting new features to show you for our 2024 point2 release so let's just dive on in and have some fun while we learn we have created a new library window that you can use as a beta version accessing it through the current Library window at the bottom here you will be then able to try it out as you can see all of the clo provided assets are available for you along with some additional ones for your use we have kept all the same great viewing options and have even included a few more access to the connect assets have never been simpler with a quick switch of a button you can flip between the Clow and connect assets at ease the connection to close set is even faster and easier to work with than ever before with direct access to your company's rooms work rooms and all your favorite garments you'll be able to use the CL ecosystem to its fullest you'll also have the ability to create your own libraries from your own personal folders to easily pull them into CL at any time if you ever want to go back to the original Library you can easily do that through the back button FL is now offering two different color modes to work within you can work in either a light or dark mode access to these options will be found within your user settings under user interface appearance once you change the mode you want you will have to restart the software and then you can work seamlessly within that color mode now you will have more control over your sewing lines when saving modular blocks within the user settings under other modular Library when checking on Notch sewing the modular block will have the sewing lines follow your notches instead of the pattern segments making Gathering or pleated garments easier to sew and save and view within your modular blocks to account for all workflows we have created an optional Safeguard within modular within your user settings under other modular Library you can check on prevent mix and match this will give users guidance that when switching to a different styles block this may not fit properly with the style you currently have in the 3D window users can listen to this and select okay or if you want to still add the block you can simply override the guidance and hit override now that I have a garment set up I can start to clean it up which is where this great update of convert to point will be helpful with a right click and selecting convert to curve or segment point I can then select either convert point only which will only convert this one point or maintain curve making sure that the curved line stays intact and most likely creating multiple curve points to do it having symmetry is so helpful but sometimes you only want to have an internal liner shape or even a Bas line ler shape on just one of the pattern pieces like my tag here with this update of being able to unlink internal and baselines you can still keep your pattern symmetrical while only having the information you need on each one being able to quickly edit and adjust measurements and lengths and Clow has always been very important and now you can do it even faster when the change length update which allows you to select multiple segments at once and then change all the links together editing and clo is easier and faster than ever I have this hem here but I want to update this style and replace it with a puffy hem dxf that I have from another garment with the replace pattern update replacing patterns is so much easier you now don't have to worry about having the same amount of segment points but if you do have the same amount of segment points this tool will still work really well for you but if you don't have the same amount of segment points you can now still replace that pattern just tell CL which points are the anchor points and K will do the rest and since replacing patterns keeps the sewing Fabric and internal line information all you have to do is hit simulate and then you're done we know how important grainline is through the Garment creation process so we have updated our grain line with more industry standard information and also optional safeguards for all of our users you can input your graen line degree or Direction number here link or unlink to other colorways and also decide the orientation if it should be one 2 or four-way you will also have the option of blocking this which will provide you with safeguards when using other features that involve grain line CH has a great update for grade groups you can now go to a graded size and add in a new size above you can either add in a full smaller grade size like here automatically or you can add in a half size like this automatically as long as you have grading information already in cl cl will do all the work for you here I have an obj trim along with some button Trims and everything that I need to grade out in this new release of Clow you can easily do this using all the same gr grading tools for patterns you can now just easily grade out those obj trims using them just don't forget to glue the trim to the pattern we have added in our new pressure fit map into grade reveal allowing you to use the strain stress and pressure fit maps all within the grade review so you can see all of your graded sizes side by side and in any layout you want we have added an extra layer of organization to our P object browser or points of your object browser now you can organize your P how you want to through our folders this structure will also be saved out when you export these PS to CSV files you can now show or high degraded sizes within your PM object browser using this ey tool you can hide or show each graded size when you're ready to go into production our nesting algorithm has never been faster or more accurate and now you can choose which colorways you want to link with your nesting settings you can either choose current all or Custom Custom will allow you to choose which colorway you want to follow these nesting properties and as you can see our nesting speed has increased along with some great updates with viewing graded sizes and different options of information within the print layout now we also have added in an option to group your graded sizes this will put all of your graded sizes in grouped areas along the marker while still trying to find the most efficient way to lay them all out clone now has given the user the ability to control the breast shape of the Avatar through Avatar editor there are three different shaping adjustment options shape here you can choose if you want a rounder shape or more teardrop shape space this will determine if there space between the breast should be narrow or wide height this will decide where the breast should sit on the body if it should be higher or lower flattening within glow has always been very easy and a great way to start a project especially if you don't have any patterns already with our Improvement we have made it so that once you have flattened your pattern you can easily jump into your 2D work space and start working right away instead of needing to organize the space now that the pattern will follow the green line everything is set up properly allowing you to create your garment in minutes after flattening and adjusting my pattern a bit I'm ready to add some construction details like seam taping to my pattern here we have updated our options for extending our seam taping within the property editor you now have three options for extending the seam taping none so no extension is necessary to outline extended to the outline of the pattern to seam taping this will extend to the edge of the following seam taping these options allow for more realistic seam taping in the digital world so that your digital twin is closer to its physical even more now that my garment is all set I'm ready to create some fabric for it I can quickly go into to my fabric Creator here and start to create some fabric a great Improvement we have made is to our UI for the fabric content this will make it even easier for you to create the fabric content you need and I can still use these great glow presets to create textures and truly realistic looking fabric here I can continue to adjust my fabric texture using the texture generator here this will allow me to bring in different fabric textures and create a seamless repeat quickly and easily within CL what's really nice is now I can flip through my different maps and make sure that this seamless repeat looks good throughout all of them so that my fabric looks exactly like I want it to look we have always been able to recolor fabric within Clow but as you can see here using the same color swatch you can get vastly different results depending on how you recolor the fabric the first one here I did a color overlay simply adding in this green color chip to the fabric Swatch the second one I desaturated the Swatch and then added in the color chip I can play around with the shadows and brightness to get the effect I want for our third one I used our new color switch option which is the same typ technique as our color switch option in the multi-texture generator but here GL will pick one color to switch out making the fabric closer to its original with a complete color switch for one color as you can see it will work with any of these colors that I choose now I'm ready to move on to my next project which I have here in my 3D State what's really nice is I now get a preview of each 3D State while I hover over it so I now know which one to select easier to make knitwear look even more realistic we have made some improvements to our knitwear feature here we have added in the option of yarn variant this will create imperfections to the knit to make it look even more realistic we have provided our users with two options a regularity this will determine how much the yarn moves you can control this through scale this will decide how much you want the yarn to move or frequency this will determine how often the yarn Direction changes also we have peling this will create hles within the yarn and you can control this through length how long you want the pole to be thickness how thick you want the yarn to be and frequency how often you want to see the yarn pulled you can use just one or both but when you use both it looks even better we have updated our property editor window to include some new options for geometry and have moved our render thickness to be within this section we have also included some new options for how to express this thickness which will be very helpful when exporting out with everywhere and also within the software you can decide if the render thickness you are adding should be placed forward backward or both you can also decide which face should be seen or hidden the front back or seam with side geometry you can now control how much or how little mesh should be on the side the more mesh the more refined this will look we have made colorway even more intuitive and dynamic than before you can use the simple ad tool here to quickly add in a colorway or you can use the more advanced add option when using the more advanced ad options PL has now provided reminders on how each option works the classic way of adjusting color Wes is always an ultimate favorite of mine but we have also improved our drag and dropping options so that you can do even more with less clicks now you can simply drag and drop your fabrics and using control you can cycle through the different ad options assigned to All colorways by linking all properties assign to current colorway only assigned to All colorways by unlinking materials first I chose the current colorway only and when dropping in your 3D window you will only be able to apply it to the pattern piece you are dropping it on next I drag and drop this lining and apply it using assigned to All colorways by unlinking materials again since I applied this in the 3D window This only affects the pattern that I applied now I'm going to drag and drop within the colorway editor I'm going to use the assigned to current colorway only now this will change any pattern piece that's using the fabric because I'm dropping it in the colorway editor instead of the 3D window my final ad will be to use the assigned to all colorways and Link all properties I'm going to apply this to my tag pattern here in my 3D window and this will make it so that all colorways have the same color throughout you can also use this drag and drop technique with Graphics as well what's also really nice is if you use the wrong add option you can always rightclick and change it back you can also now very quickly hide a graphic in all other colorways through the rightclick hide other Graphics now in CL you can control your Avatar's mesh size turning the mesh on you'll be able to see more clearly these differences through divide mesh within the property editor you can make your Avatar even smaller which will help with any Collision issues like the one I'm seeing on the legs here you can go all the way up to three and as low as one and don't forget you can always turn it off CL is faster than ever with the update to our GPU simulation you can find it within the simulation tool simply click and hold down and switch to GPU and your space bar can do the rest as you can see simulating in GPU everything goes much faster and the movements are like butter on the screen I can also easily push back these Trims and not worry about Collision getting in the way even on these multi-layered garments GPU is extremely stable and faster than ever while still in GPU simulation I can keep editing and adjusting my garment to get this styling just right here I'm going going to adjust my straps using the pins tool while easily selecting an area within the 3D window I can turn on simulation and move and adjust my strap in real time what's even better is all this adjustment I'm doing here I can automatically apply to the symmetrical copy through right click I can keep adjusting and making these changes until I'm happy you have easily register the pose or motion from an fbx file to a file compatible for cl avatars making creating poses easier than ever and applying them to your clo avatars easy too to make rendering even faster and a little less work on your computer we have added in another section to our render settings mesh optimization this will only only be seen in the final render so when you hit that play button the two new options are frustrum culling so no mesh is created outside of the camera view or a camera window and LOD or level of detail the number of meshes would be reduced based off of their distance from the camera so if it's a far away distance will have less meshes for the computer to render out this is really helpful for knitware rendering and we do suggest you to use it when rendering with our knitwear tool we have now included a panoramic export option for colorway now this will be available when your Viewpoint is in current view if your Viewpoint is in custom view then the custom view option for panoramic will appear but once you're all ready you can then start your render and receive these amazing images thank you all so much for watching I hope you enjoyed and I hope you're just as excited as I was showing you these if you have any questions or if you want to learn more check out the YouTube channel there's so many great videos for you to learn everything you could ever want about CL and thanks so much again for watching don't forget to like And subscribe ",

all a greater understanding of our software the support and learning resources available to you as individual users new ideas to apply to your projects and most important the confidence that you have the support of our entire team and Community to help you achieve success so let's get started thank you again for being here it's it's an honor for us and we are excited to see what we can do together hello my name is Martina ponon or Pon and I am a 3D fashion specialist and the co-founder of the archive I have a bachelor of fashion design and a master's degree in accessories design from poly Technic Milano and a uni had started to be interested in 3D modeling because I have never been very good at drawing and I find myself visualizing things like three-dimensionally in my head and it's very hard and very frustrating to put them flat on paper and that's why I started using 3D software to design and I found it very uh intuitive and um after my graduation I started um I started uh working at hopos in Switzerland uh in 2016 and in that position I had a chance to learn a lot about how 3D can be integrated into product development processes from design to sales and I was really able to see the potential of a well very well structured workflow and during my time at the company I was working in CL 3D almost every day and when you do that for two and a half years you get to learn things very quickly so I became very uh comfortable with CLA and a lot of its uh tools and given my interest and experience with leather goods uh I had a chance to specialize in 3D modeling bags and other small leather accessories which turned out to be a very Niche but very sorta set of skills that really helped me start my freelancing career once I moved to Melbourne in 2019 as a freelancer I work with a very wide range of of Brands and designers and I get to see a lot of different applications of what I can do and for instance with independent designers I mostly operate as a sample room and they're usually looking for creative and Technical Support to develop their products and communicate them and showcase them and it's very interesting because the process is quite flexible and it's generally a onetoone with the designer themselves and you get to see the collection come to life from start to finish and you can see here an example that I'm showing from um like a design that I worked on for a holographic fashion show and the designer uh sh from Mutiny um gave me a piece from a personal uh archive and we we recreated the pattern in clue 3D animated it uh textured the Garment and then rendered and to then uh use it for the holographic show so it's quite interesting to see how you can go from a pattern to a whole show with the same asset and um I also work with mum size brands that might or might not have internal 3D design teams and most of the time there are more they have more structured processes already and what I mostly do with these companies is Consulting them on how to set up a 3D workflow to suit their needs without disrupting their processes and troubleshooting specific issues they might have and also offer offer them um Hands-On 3D services and then I also work with global brands that mostly hire Freelancers when they need uh extra pair of hands to finalize their digital uh showroom work of modeling and rendering a whole collection which might be you know like hundred and hundreds of pieces um or most of the time also for I getting I get contacted by their marketing department that are looking to develop CGI campaigns to um communicate the products and you know show them to the public and as you can see here um on this backpack like we started from an existing model that I reproduced in clo 3D with all the details the tri Etc to then use this asset both for um uh e-commerce when for with some very uh let's say like Studio like renders and then the same asset was used by another artist to create a promotional video for the product I feel like they there are two at least two different ways of approaching you know like these are two very different ways of approach approaching um 3D design because on one hand you can be very creative and on the other side sometimes you find yourself doing very repetitive tasks but um honestly I don't mind like I didn't mind also working on repetitive things because they really allowed me to hold my technical skills and these skills uh once you have them they remain and they also get you to understand the products you know like the accessories and the garments much better from a technical point of view which I think it's always essential in order to create uh 3D assets that then behave well also digitally and can be translated to real life products in 2021 I started working at rmit in Melbourne um teaching in the sustainable Innovation program which is part of the fashion and textile school and in my course I try to give my students an overall view of how 3D tools and techniques are works in the industry and we spend a fair bit of time working on soft different software but I also focus on encouraging them to get used to think critically about it and not being distracted by the hype in which innovation is most of the time wrapped in so there is a lot of noise that they need to filter to be able to learn how to use digital tools adequately within the technical and cultural context of the fashion industry and by the end of the course each one of the student gets to develop their own project and you can see two examples here which are very um indicative of what we do so there are certain students that prefer to work on very technical things uh for instance Selena worked on a custom fit zero waist uh pattern that she created and sampled in CL and illustrator and then printed out and uh actually sold all together in real life with fabric while on on the right side you can see a video from Jackson that uh decided to focus more on the storytelling that um CGI animation can help you communicate and in the last two years or so uh I started a project called the archive along with a team of other three people which is a platform that aims at making fashion archives free really accessible by digital means and we are working with museums and fashion archives to digitize garments that are usually carefully kept in storage and hardly accessible by people that want to study them or see them so what we do uh with the support of uh of course like Museum curators and conservators is to reverse engineer these garment patterns and create 3D replicas that will allow a Their audience to appreciate them appreciate them and study them in detail since uh 3D assets carry a whole range of information that photos or 3D scans alone cannot really convey and on our website we freely offered the reconstructed patterns photos renders and insight on it insights on each item uh in the hope to give the fashion Community basically the second best option to a hands-on experience with the actual garment which anyway is often not an option for many students and researchers in this way we try to bring like real craftsmanship in the 3D side of fashion mixing traditional and Innovative techniques to reconstruct and showcase um fragile or precious PES pieces that can't often be on display we encourage creatives to play with these 3D replicas as the concept of playing is usually very detached from from uh pieces collected by museums and archives and we think that creativity flourishes in an environment where experimentation and exploration are encouraged and with digital tools one can remove the risk of damaging the items and feel free to study explore deconstruct and see these objects in movement instead of behind the gallery glass and also because you always have control Z available which is very convenient and of course these whole idea came from our personal interest in garments and fashion history but it's also undeniably connected to our dislike for the current like faster and faster fashion production system that as we all know is not sustainable and the quality of garment has become appalling so they become they are considered disposable uh faster and faster which is um terrible for the environment and uh for who manufactures them and we hope that by giving creative people more tools to deepen their knowledge about wellmade garments and giving them historical insights on um fashion Heritage we might be part of a much needed uh shift toward better practices in the industry and thank you hi welcome to the your virtual user Summit for hobbyists and Freelancers we're happy to have you with us my name is Melody Tennessee and together with my colleague Ariel gold I'll be walking you through our support platforms as well as giving an overview over our digital Supermarket connect I'm located in our Munich office and have been a 3D designer at close since 2019 my background is in fashion design and together with Ariel I am focused on our growing online communities hi everyone thank you melody my name is Ariel gold I am here in our CL New York City office I have been with cl since 2020 and prior to that my background was in Apparel Design and I will let Melody kick it off let's imagine I'm facing a roadblock while working on a project in CL for this we are going to search through the official help articles and Forum posts visit CL 3d.com and navigate to resources in the upper menu on this page click on help center within the Help Center Page towards the top you will find the SE search bar let me enter the keyword fur fabric to demonstrate an example result in the left column you see there's two types of hits one with everything that came up on the community forums and the other articles on The Help Center this way you can filter by either type of result the help articles contain manuals and simple explanations looking through the forums can help in case another user has encountered a similar issue as you before help art articles are always authored by CL employees and have no discussions attached meanwhile the Q&A form enables users to interact with each other while still being monitored and also answered by close own designers that means that other users can chime in to give advice and so can you users that are especially active receive routine rewards for

future I hope you guys join our Discord and we cannot wait to see you and answer your questions there thank you hello everyone my name is gonu and I'm currently studying fashion design in pman Germany I have always had huge passion for fashion but my journey took a pivot turn while I start exploring digital tool for design in that time as student have completed two internships which give me valuable industry insights however it was until recently that I began using close 3D a software that has really transformed my creativity process and this year I took part place in the digital fashion contest 2024 and was fortunate enough to play seconds this was significant achievement for me as showcase how far I've have come emerging technology with my fashion design skill now I'm focused on using 3D technology to bring my ideas to life more efficiently and with a great position I start using CL in the early part of this year mostly driven by the Curiosity and the need to speed up my design process as someone who always wanted to visualize my ideas more quickly and clearly CL has been a game changer for me Lear learning to use CL was a self-taught journey one that wasn't part of my internships but it felt like a natural extension of my learning professionally I use clo in various aspects of design from sketching initial ideas to testing garments structures and fit virtually it's incredibly useful when I come to experimenting with Silhouettes fabrics and texture without having to physically produce samples this not only saves time but also allow me to make more sustainable choice in the design process now I'd like to introduce you to one of my recent projects perfect boy this project explore the idea of masculinity and how it is shaped by complex culture expectations growing up experienced the traditional Norms from my homeland and value collectivism and addition we are also incanting the more IND individualistic pressure that prevalent aboard those two forces often push against each other creating tension around what is mean to be the perfect board and fashion become my medium to explore this concept through this project I experiment with the shape and structure of garments using close 3D TOS to push the boundaries of how masculinity can be represented my aim was to challenge your traditional ideas on masculinity by distracting and reshaping garments in unconventional way and I played with extravagant Silhouettes and asymmetric cards allowing the digital space to serve as my coners of innovation and here is the final 3 animation for the project perfect boy you reflecting on experiences I believe that while internships and projects provides foundational knowledge they often like the exposure of the latest tour like clo that are Transforming Our industry learning clo on my own and using it in real world projects such as poy boy has better prepared me for the fast pacing demands of the Fashion World and looking forward I see 3D fashion playing a crucial role in the future of our industry especially when comes to Su sustainability by reducing the needs for physical samples we can minimize waste safe time and lower production cost I also believe that 3D tools will reshape how designer collaborates globally instead of sending physical samples back and forth we can work in real time through digital platform which will Foster a faster more connected and infected design community so in conclusion swey fashion is not just a trend it's a essential evolution in how we design and produce clothing I'm excited to be part of this journey and looking forward to continue use this tool to bring my ideas and creative diversion to life thank you very much hi everyone I'm coralan a fre design and implementation

and I would like to show you how I use glow as an artistic tool I'm a 3D artist based in Madrid Spain I came here ER in first place to study art history and graphic design and I start working after that on my first AUD visual projects and also as a video editor but the truth was that I was really unsure about my professional future and suddenly the 3D World appeared in my life and change everything ER I instantly fell in love and in 2016 I start watching H tutorials and learning by my own H I began to uh master different uh 3D softwares because it's necessary to control h different softwares depending of the task on the task uh like texturing compositing or creating clothes uh in the case of clo and so on in 2018 I began H using Marvelous Designer before Club here H because I wanted to create my own garments H until that moment ER I have been ring libraries from different artists for the 3D but I wanted to create more specific and unit pieces for my Works H and when I discovered Marvelous Designer I unexpectedly develop a strong interest in fashion design that I never had before in my life ER because really in try me H patterns how they work H the different Fabrics their behavior and um you know after creating my first pair of pants and my first dress I I wanted to go farther and create garments with more complexity and and also trying to create my own garments but also trying to recreate garments from a fashion designers that I really admire or other brands my work is inspired by woman and introspective themes that I explore through the internal action of my characters and the also the environment h i draw heavily from my academic background in art history H also in contemporary artist and social media ER film photography sculpture architecture I have a deep connection with music and nature as well H and this element serve as my main source of inspiration H enriching my my creative process and giving me new ideas okay so now I want to share with you a few projects the first one is surreal clothing this is also my first garment animation I want to create a dream world with articles of clothing come to life h a scenarios full of color of Happiness of fun H moving with Grace and creativity and enjoying the the freedom and excitement of being alive   [Applause]   hey the second one uh is digital nissus this is h a criticis of social media and the false dis appearances I took the myth of narcissus as inspiration I wanted to make an outfit that look like a flower and has many Raffles that you know that helps to create contrast of Lights and Shadows since I also started uh from the Baro T aesthetic to create this composition Okay the third one is Puffy I wanted to create a a down jacket in this occasion and I don't know sometimes I improvise on the flight I ended up making uh like a CIO puffy pockets on the front side I don't know but honestly I love it I love the final look and with this makeup and these ornaments on the face I don't know this is how it looks and the one is called and it's completely inspired by a 7s music from Spain I wanted to create a sort of tribute to the vanand and I cre made a total of eight looks I guess inspired by the 70s but it's also with 1 touches of fantasy now I want to talk about my workflow and all the steps I follow uh till the final result the first thing I do is a mud bar in this case I only made uh one for the type of pant uh and sleeves that I want to achieve as well as the colors I want to throughout all the composition and the next step was to open that studio and create my character once it was to my liking I loged in uh looping cut work animation and in another project I love different poses in order to have uh just a static renders of the final composition in CLW I started making the top and lastly the pants even though I have a a mware I like to experiment in all the process um and vary and add things to the patterns like the silver strips on the on both parts of the of the outfit I also want to give a 13 Galactic touch on the shoulders of the top part and the sleeves are like a bishop sleeve style massive massive bishop and sleeve and I want them to have a sort of bits and so what I do is apply horizontal lines uh along of the of the sleeve and Alternate the strength and the angle of the folding so some lines have 0 degree angle and others 36 and also what I add is an increase of the H and V shrinkage and and so what I achieve is this result I love this sleeves I think they are really cool and the last one is that I apply the the animation that we made in in that 3D and exported in in a liic to Cinema 4D in Cinema 4 the I create the scene I want an interior with a Skyline on the top of the ceiling and a space that follow with the chromatic palette of the of the outfit and depending on the project I texturing directly on claw sometimes in San painter and other times like in this case in Thea 4D so once everything has materials and textures apply I focus on the lining uh which is the final step before export when I export the final render and the animation I add in post production the sound of the video and the ambient and this is the final result   I think CL is an incredible program that greatly Fosters creativity for digital artists for designers that marks a before and after not just in how it's perceived digital fashion but also in how it's created and how it's done throughout history art and technology has always um uh Advanced H in hand um allowing us always go one or a few steps ahead I consider technology as a friend and it excites me to think what will come next when people ask me what I do and I don't quite understand how all this is done i' like to conclude by saying this is technological magic hi again I would like to briefly introduce you to the learning resources we offer for our individual users note that you can find this information on our learning Ates in the

        "publishedAt": "2024-10-02T05:00:14Z",
        "Transcript": "00. Introduction and Purpose Hello, Everyone! Wouldn't you love to try on a unique garment¬†in Snapchat? Create your own one-of-a-kind AR filter with your special design! With¬†EveryWear, it's exceptionally easy. Snapchat is a social networking service where you can take photos or videos and¬†share them with other users. In this tutorial, we'll learn how to convert¬†garments created in CLO and Marvelous Designer¬†into Snapchat AR filters using EveryWear. Before we dive into making Snapchat AR¬†filters, if you haven't gone through¬†the basic tutorial for EveryWear, We strongly¬†recommend you to learn the basics first before¬†proceeding with this tutorial. Please refer¬†to the link above or the description below. 01. Lens Studio Rules Guide To create Snapchat AR filters, you'll¬†need to use a program called Lens¬†Studio. Please download and install¬†Lens Studio from the link provided. In this tutorial, we‚Äôll be¬†using Lens Studio version 4.49. For the manual and important¬†guidelines for creating AR filters, Please refer to the description below. Ensure that the mesh count is under 100,000 triangles, \nwith a recommended¬†polygon count of under 60,000. The¬†texture size should be 2048x2048 or less,¬†\nand the lens size should be under 8MB. Please download the Body mesh for Lens Studio,¬†\nwhich is required for garment creation,¬†from the link in the description. 02. EveryWear Create and dress the garment using CLO. \nThen,¬†we'll use EveryWear for garment optimization¬†and baking texture maps. Since EveryWear¬†works the same within both CLO and Marvelous¬†Designer, Feel free to use¬†whichever software you prefer. Downloading Garments from¬†CONNECT and Importing the Avatar. The garment we‚Äôll use in this¬†tutorial is available on CONNECT. Click the link above to access¬†CONNECT. \nAdd the garment to your cart, complete the purchase, and download the file. Secondly, import the¬†‚ÄòBody_Mesh_With_Skeleton_A_Pose.fbx‚Äô¬†file that you downloaded for¬†Lens Studio into CLO by dragging¬†and dropping it, making sure to set¬†the options according to the image. Import the downloaded garment into CLO Fitting Simulate the garment on the¬†avatar you just imported. Since the provided avatar is a low mesh, You may notice some angular¬†areas on the garment‚Äôs surface. In this case, click on the avatar and use the¬†\n[Property Editor] > [Surface] > [Divide Mesh] feature¬†on the right side to smooth out the avatar‚Äôs¬†surface. If you‚Äôre using Marvelous Designer, \nclick on the avatar and use the [Property¬†Editor] > [Smooth Avatar] function instead. After applying this setting, \npress the simulate¬†button again to smooth the garment‚Äôs surface. Rigging Once the garment fitting is complete,¬†\nClick [CONNECT] > [EveryWear] at the¬†top to open the EveryWear window. In the¬†Garment tab of EveryWear, we‚Äôll proceed with the garment optimization and the rigging. The recommended mesh count is below 60,000, \nSo enter 60,000 in the space¬†next to ‚ÄòGarment‚Äô to optimize. Simulate the garment again after¬†the optimization is complete. Click ‚ÄòApply‚Äô under Rigging¬†to initiate Auto Rigging. Since rigging will be performed¬†again in Lens Studio, \nwe won‚Äôt make¬†any skin weight adjustments at this point. If you want to make any shape adjustments, \nyou can use the Sculpt Brush to smooth¬†the surface or refine the shape. When the adjustments are complete, \nclick¬†the Exit button to close the Brush window. UV Packing and Texture Baking Once the rigging is complete, \nswitch¬†to the Material tab in the EveryWear¬†window to start working on the textures. Before packing the UVs, \nyou need to set the image size in advance. Choose your desired image¬†size from the options provided. According to the Lens Studio manual, \nmake sure the texture¬†size is below 2048x2048. For this tutorial, we will set the texture size to 1024x1024. After setting both the image size and seam size, \nclick the Pack UVs button. Modify the settings¬†as needed, then click Apply to run UV packing. Once the packing is complete, \nclick¬†Exit to return to the Material tab. In Texture Baking, check the maps you¬†want to generate, \nthen click the Apply button. We will use the default settings¬†provided. When the baking is completed, \nyou will see the generated Normal¬†Map and Ambient Occlusion Map. After the Texture Baking is complete, the¬†number of materials corresponding to the UV tiles will be created in the Material List¬†below. If you want to use various materials for the garment in Lens Studio, \nplease divide¬†the materials accordingly. For this tutorial, we will proceed with just one¬†material without dividing materials. Upload Once all the work is complete, \nclick¬†the Upload button to open the Export options window. Since we‚Äôre only exporting¬†the garment, uncheck the avatar. Choose the necessary textures from the options¬†below, \nthen click OK to upload to CONNECT. Access CONNECT to download the FBX file. When you unzip the downloaded zip file, \nyou‚Äôll see the generated FBX file¬†along with the texture map files. 03. Lens Studio In Lens Studio, you will convert¬†and prepare the garment created in CLO into a lens that can be used¬†\non Snapchat. Please open Lens Studio, which you installed earlier. Click the¬†[New Project] button to open a new window. We will proceed in the following¬†order: \nRigging, Material Settings, adding a Body Occluder, and¬†\nthen Uploading the Lens. Rigging In Lens Studio, we will merge the¬†default body mesh with the garment¬†that you created to make them move along together. Click the [+] button next to¬†Object in the top left corner,¬†\nthen select [Full Body Mesh] to add¬†the body mesh. To avoid confusion,¬†rename the Body Mesh to match the garment‚Äôs¬†name. For example, let's rename it to \"Dress.\" In the bottom left corner, click the [+] button¬†in Resources, \nthen select [Import File]. Choose the FBX garment file you downloaded from¬†\nCONNECT. Import it with the default settings. Click on the added [Full Body Mesh] in Resources. Since the garment was created for the avatar in A-Pose, change the [External Mesh Pose]¬†to A-Pose in the Inspector window on the¬†right. If you worked with an avatar¬†in T-Pose, set it to T-Pose instead. Click [External Mesh] and¬†select the FBX file you just imported. You should see the body¬†mesh updated with the garment in the preview window on the right. Make¬†sure the Body Index is also set to 0. Material Now, let‚Äôs set up the textures for the garment. In the bottom left corner,¬†click the [+] button in Resources, \nthen select [Import File] and choose¬†the map files downloaded from CONNECT. Click on Dress in the top left corner, then in the¬†\nInspector on the right, find the [Material] under¬†[Render Mesh Visual]. Right-click on Material and¬†click Select to open the detailed settings window. In the detailed settings, \ncheck the Two sided¬†option to set the material to be double-sided. Add the map files you previously saved in the¬†\nAsset Browser to the Textures section of the Material settings window. Adjust the details to¬†configure the material to your desired settings. If you want to use the maps created in EveryWear,¬†\nclick the [+] button in Resources > [Material] > Add [Uber PBR]. Select the Dress in the [Object] menu,¬†\nand apply the newly added [Uber PBR] in the [Material] section. Then, select the Uber PBR and add the¬†appropriate textures in the settings window. Adding Body Occluder In this section, we‚Äôll add a transparent¬†body mesh to cover areas hidden by the¬†body when applying the garment filter. This¬†process is known as Adding Body Occluder. Click the [+] button in the Objects¬†section in the top left corner,\nand select [Full Body Mesh] to add a body¬†mesh. Move the newly added Body Mesh to the parent garment‚Äôs 3D Body Tracking 0 and¬†delete the remaining 3D Body Tracking 1. In the Resources tab, select the added¬†[Full Body Mesh2], \nset the [Body index] to 0,¬†and change the Pose to A pose. Also, in¬†the Objects section in the top left corner, \nselect [Body Mesh] and set the¬†[Transform position] X to 0. Check the Preview window on the right to ensure¬†that the body mesh follows¬†the movements correctly. Apply a transparent material to the¬†added body mesh. In the top left corner, select [Body Mesh] in Objects, \nthen in¬†the top right corner under Inspector,¬†\nclick [Material], and click the¬†[+] button to add an [Occluder]. Select the added [Occluder] and¬†click [OK] to apply the material. Preview on Device Before publishing the lens, you can preview¬†it. If you have linked your Snapchat account, click [Send to Snapchat] in the top¬†right corner to preview the lens¬†on your device. Make sure to check¬†that the lens is working correctly. Publish Lens Once all tasks are complete,¬†proceed with publishing the lens. Click the [Performance] button in the¬†top left corner to check the lens size. Please make sure that the¬†size of your lens is under 8MB. Next, click the [Project Info] button to fill¬†in the details. You can either record your own video for the Lens Preview or¬†\nuse the default video provided. Click the [+] button under Preview¬†to set the thumbnail image. Please add a captured or rendered image of your outfit. After checking the lens name¬†and details, click [Apply]. Then, click [Publish Lens] to upload the lens¬†\nto Snapchat. The Snapchat‚Äôs my-lense page will automatically open, where you should select the¬†folder to place the lens and click [Submit Lens]. When the lens detail settings page opens,¬†\nenter the Category and Tag. Once you enter all information, click [Save as Draft] to initiate¬†\nthe review process. The lens status will show as Processing on the lens list, and it will be¬†updated to Available once the review is complete. Go to the lens detail page and click the [Publish] button to finalize. The publish will be¬†completed after a brief review process is conducted. You can also adjust the¬†visibility settings after publishing. 04.
