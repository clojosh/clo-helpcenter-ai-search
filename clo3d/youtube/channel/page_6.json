        "Transcript": "hi everyone welcome to the fourth session of Cl academic month 2023 it's a pleasure to have you here let us know in in the chat from where you're joining hi from India UK hi Wendy Andrea Maria from Montenegro hello hi laa from the UK hello Professor ywan it's a pleasure to see you here H from Indonesia Egypt that's so nice to have you all with us from Canada Luxembourg hi from Finland so we are about to start so thank you everyone for coming the academic month is happening every Wednesday it started in October 18 3 weeks ago and it will go until next week November 15 um so thank you for joining this is an opportunity to showcase the work done by the schools how they've implemented cl to their curriculum and before I tell you a bit more about the academic month and then we hear from the German um International University from Kido I would like to introduce myself for those who doesn't know me my name is Fernanda um I'm the academic lead for claw Europe I joined CLW in 2021 as a 3D designer my background is in fashion design and today my work is to support schools when implementing Claw from training to licenses and any other support needed so if you'd like to teach Claw at your school or if you need any help with implementation please contact us you you should see now a link on the screen you can just send us a message and it will be a pleasure to help you with me today we have the the German International University from kaido I will introduce you to them very soon but before I want to tell you about the purpose of the academic month so our idea is to give this stage to universities so they can share with us how they've implemented CL we have so many successful stories and we think that this needs to be shared so we can learn from one another and also be inspired especially the ones who are still in the implementation process this is the third edition um of the academic month it started in 2021 and you can find the link to the previous recordings in our YouTube channel so I highly recommend you check it out you can click here on the screen um we have sessions since 2021 and you can be inspired by other schools they have shared with us how they've implemented cl to their curriculum so um um we started in October 18th as I mentioned with Institute of SEI they shared with us how they've implemented clo to their pattern making classes um it was a really nice session where they've they've showed um how they created their classes and implemented to um to their pattern making classes and I highly recommend you having a look the recordings will be very soon in our YouTube channel uh then we had a talk about Erasmus Plus funding we had three schools design school coding from Denmark William de coning Academy from the Netherlands and the University of lujuana from Slovenia they shared with us how they together um applied for Erasmus Plus funding and how they succeed uh in order to run a 3D fashion education program it was a really nice presentation it was not about implementation in this case but but we thought it was super important to share the steps of how they've done it and also Inspire other schools that are looking for for funding last week we had shape not size with the University of Arts Bournemouth they shared with us how they've implemented claw and also they shared the research of the professor Penelope Norman about how bisoke Avatar can improve sustainability inclusivity and fit it was super interesting she shared a lot of information about um body scanning so if you're interested in body scanning keep it U keep an eye on our YouTube channel because the recording will be posted very soon today we are talking about implementation from scratch we will hear from German International University from kaido how they've designed the course and implemented cl to their curriculum and what I find fascinating about this session is is that they will also share how they've created interdisciplinary projects um with the computer and science um Department to motivate students and also you know not only use clo for the development of the governments but also to um participate in events and collaborate um along the the courses then next week it's our last session uh we will have the University of Hanover sharing with us real Meats digital so the Garment that you see um in the picture it's from aduk from the 16th century and they will share with us how they've digitized the patterns that belong to um a museum so here it's an invitation for you if you'd like to present next year let us know drop us a message it will be a pleasure to have you here that's all from my side I want to give the stage now to the German University um of Cairo um and first of all we have francisa she's a digital artist and instructor she is the the clo trainer at the University and she will tell us about how she designed the clo classes we have with us as well Dr n she's the program supervisor and lecturer of computer science and Bianca who is a researcher um associate lecture and a doctor candidate so welcome welcome to this the stage thank you so much for accepting my invitation it's such a pleasure to have you here I remember um Francisco when we talked on the beginning of the year and you told me about how you were teaching CL and I was super um inspired and I think it's a great opportunity for us to share with everyone so welcome um why don't you start by introducing yourself and sharing your screen so hello hello yes I'm I'm honored to welcome you on behalf of the German International University and thank you Fernanda for inviting us to speak about the implementation of Cl in the guu fashion design curriculum I'm especially grateful that um to be able to present the students work to a global audience in this context and I kindly ask for some patience and the reception of the students work because it is my focus to Showcase these young talents implementation from scratch an approach to digitize fashion education at the guu in CYO now I would like to introduce the speakers and my valuable colleagues who are deeply involved in the process of implementing CL at guu so I give over to Bianca first hello hello I'm Bianca kotan um I'm a research associate funded by the Dr the German academic for and service and I'm currently employed at the htw Berlin University of applied sciences I'm onethird of a small team the other two parts are two German professors host fet and Katherine hins of the faculty of culture and design in Berlin at this htw and actually we have been invited by the guu German International University as collaborative consultants for the establishment and the further development of the giu faculty of design additionally I'm a doctoral candidate at the Academy of fin Arts Vienna where I'm dealing with the digital as well I'm looking into how social media change design processes in uh the the Berlin fashion scene additionally I'm a lecturer at the UDA Berlin and I'm at the B Hala uh especially looking on privileged critical design practices and theories francisa invited me to speak here and I feel very very honored um because as a research associate I was in a position of significant influence to co- initiate the hiring of Francisca I um saw her doing her education for a lot of months I see I saw the potential and uh to me it spoke immediately that it would be uh so nice to have her at uh uh the German International University in Cairo so I not all I not only kind of like really pushed for the recruitment but additionally I made space in the curriculum um and to really Implement her abilities uh yes that's for my part and uh now I give to word back to F yeah thank you Bianca for bringing me to guu so I'm francisa angger the lead and conceptual executor in implementing CL as an instructor for digital fashion design at theu Fashion Design Department I will introduce myself more deeply in the next slides so I will end over the stage now to Dr NADA sh okay so first of all I'd like to thank you for inviting me to join the talk today and for actually inviting me to join along the work so my name is NAD Shara and I'm from the computer science and informatics faculty at the giu and I actually have uh a passion towards digitizing things this is something that I work on whether it's uh manufacturing Industries Educational Tools and experiences and this is why I think digital fashion caught my eye I also have a big passion towards visualization and creating different visual let's say explanations and visual uh experiences and immersive experiences and um this is why the projects that we've done in digital fashion was the perfect uh showcase or use case for everything that I'm interested in and uh it was also able to attract a lot of uh our passionate students who've joined along the projects that we will see parts of today so thank you so we will now present the following topics together in this webinar firstly I will give a brief overview of how I came from a fashion designer to the 3D World then Bianca ksan will introduce to you the giu and the implementation of Cl in our curriculum I will then go on to explain the content of the two courses fashion technology one and C pattern two and together we will present our projects which were also developed in collaboration with Dr NADA Shaga from faculty of informatics and computer science and finally we will give an insight into our vision of how we want to continue teaching dtive fashion in the future it is important for me to briefly explain my background as this has a major influence on my didactic approach today I call myself a digital concept artist specializing in fashion design and digital visualization my journey started with a solid practical education with a bachelor and master degree in conceptual fashion design at Brookie wienstein University of Art and Design H in Germany focusing on conceptualization and master in high-end processing techniques before venturing into the digital world I worked as a freelance designer for avanguard Berlin fashion labels in design and production as well as for seatan Opera Productions across Germany when my freelance work was interrupted in 2021 due to the co lockdown I decided Ed to do a certified nine months further education in swedi fashion design under the supervision of Claudia Str at the TR Academy stutgart in Germany and gained professional work experience as a freelance 3D fashion visualizer at 3ds.com together with the team of sedia I worked on projects for bun Bach and hoves and visualized photorealistic digital garments in April 2022 I was then invited by Bianca kotan as a guest lecturer to the chu in Cairo Egypt and since September 2022 I have been permanently entrusted with the task of digitizing fashion design education through the implementation of clo in the winter semester 2022 I immediately initiated a collaboration with the Department of informatics and computer science at guu through Dr Shar to explore how digital garments can be used and presented in the virtual world what sets me apart as an educator is the seamless transition between analog and digital fashion design my ability to combine these two practices allows me to effectively transfer my knowledge to students through applied and effective workflows I perceive the digital space as an artistic potential and the design with cl goes far beyond the visualization of patterns therefore my research Focus Beyond teaching is a radical exploration of the potential of digital fashion again Beyond visualization of patterns this animation shows where the German International University is located we are about 50 kilometers outside of Cairo placed in the new administrative Capital this new administrative Capital was started to be buil in 2015 and in the near future the Egyptian Parliament Ministries and   Embassy IES will be relocated there this location is of great importance as an international educational institution with industry focused and future oriented Bachelor Masters and PHD programs the giu was founded in 2018 including the giu faculty of design as well as the informatics and computer science faculty November 2023 the giu consists of nine faculties and approximately 5,000 students in total in our education we are focusing on students to become leading personalities and give them the best education to have the chance to perform on a local and Global industry what is special is that it is not a specific design or art school but since it is a university of applied Sciences we have the possibility of an inner University collaboration of superior quality from factive design and faculty of informatics and computer science yes well so let's have a look into the faculty of design so we have right now two departments fashion design department and Industrial design Department all in all the who faculty is quite small just 183 students right now but we're growing quickly and just to give you an idea like who is there and what are the people doing there so we have two professors and three instructors six Tas in fashion design and three professors two lecturers one instructor and four Tas in industrial design and as you can see almost an equal share of the students round about 60 additionally there's the pre-semester where there's 53 students and these are the youngest ones who um have not decided yet if they want to go to Industrial or fashion design but due to F's work a lot of people are quite excited for fashion design I have to say so what are we doing there in the faculty of design is that we are putting a very very high emphasis on practical experience in the design education and that means that we're recruiting staff mostly for their tangible industry experience and not so much for academic experience because we really really want to have successful designers teaching from the Mina region primarily additionally from France Italy or Germany um the education is tailored for both local and Global design Industries and the training we are providing is aimed to provide cultural engagement as well as industry growth so we're in the middle of building constant networks into local and Global Industries via internships field trips gas Elric collaborators and sponsors and our goal is to amplify voices and talents from the Mina regions because students from the Mina regions especially in design are very very vital but yet under represented uh we're preparing the students for a global academic and design sector and at that point I would really like to thank a lot for the outstanding support for realizing the implementation of digital fashion into the curriculum by the SCH University but especially too by the upper management of the guu financing all the equipment the licenses and the labs supporting exhibitions financially providing contacts whenever necessary and praising and complimenting our work so that we stay motivated and I would give the word now to Nada to show us the faculty of informatics and computer science yeah so for the faculty of informatics we actually um have four majors and these Majors I like always to call them they're very futuristic Majors so these are Majors that are currently needed and currently being used and this would be the case for years to come and these Majors include in this case data science where students will not only learn so um for the software engineering major we um hope to uh teach the students on how to build robust systems uh different types of mobile and desktop and we systems from Gathering requirements to building architectures to make sure that they work now and they work in the future and now because we have lots of data and it's actually an asset so this is why it security is really important now we need to focus on securing systems securing uh operations and this actually ensures the business continuity and lastly we have the media informatics major and this is where the information is Media this includes videos this includes images so you learn how to build 3D um objects you learn how to do 3D designs you learn how to build immersive experiences you learn how to actually deal with image processing and computer vision and as you can see the teaching and the majors are widespread so so is the interest of the faculty members so we have hardcore research in machine learning in deep learning in um natural language process in um we also work a lot with building immersive and engaging experiences in different types of contexts and in different realities like augmented reality like virtual reality um and in this case we collaborate with the Inca group from hativ Berlin so they have a very very long experience on building uh public interactive uh displays and experiences and we actually learn uh quite a lot from them we are collaborating closely and they help us a lot in terms of technicalities in terms of tools in terms of building the whole experience and uh in regards to our collaboration with the design faculty this was also one very uh strong example on how uh things are driven by Passion so the projects that we've been working on were not part of the curricula or part of projects or courses that students have to work on they were all extracurricular and we were able to actually attract two teaching assistants and around 20 students who have joined the project and have been working uh amazingly and learning and producing a lot of amazing output for the past uh year and we'll be able to see parts of that uh throughout the presentation today so since it's CL academic month I dare to Bard you with some spreadsheets here I mean I I have no found no other way to show curriculums maybe something needs to be done nada I don't know so well what did we do so what we like to present is that we not just had like one close 3D project or this and that collaboration partner but actually from the minute on that I met fana and um I know her capabilities I knew that it would be really a great chance for the University if this is more a holistic approach and that we because we're very Young University use the chance that we're not already so subtle in what we do and that there's kind of like this person is teaching that and the other one this and there's no possibility or it's hard to change so we started right on the first in the second semester it's the third column you see there's a module called fashion technology normally or in the initiatively dedicated to pattern making but since frana arrived we decided no we're going to start right away with clone we're going to not not um there there's a part 50% is analog pattern making but the students actually start with clo the pattern making and I know everybody that sits here in this uh little conference I think you know why because students really understand so easily how especially even complicated pattern work if you can put it on an avatar and show what happens when you change the pattern so um so we have this basis and this is the continuous basis additionally in the fifth semester Trana comes back it's the turquaz uh Little Square here that's called C pattern two and this is 100% of the course in clo where actually fra uses the ability she has going beyond the pattern and really introducing fashion and digitality to a very experimental and large extent we're going to see the projects to make you understand what it's about but we didn't want it to leave this kind of like alone in the um curriculum so it's always a combination with the main collection project to that's actually like kind of well the main project where the students are working on their conceptual stuff so the conceptual fashion design framework with the topics and everything comes from the main collection project to and the students have a lot of time to really create immersive interesting digital fashion with fra um then additionally there's two plays in the main collection project 3 in the sixth semester optional 30% it really depends on the collaboration partner if they are interested or if there's somehow a perspective that would make it interesting or necessary to introduce or to reintroduce or to further develop with the students and as you can see until the point of the bachelor thesis our students quite have a lot of training in claw and they're actually able to experiment on their own even without an instructor Contin ously and some of course decide then for a bachelor thesis 100% digital and this is of course possible as well right now we have uh some students already graduated some in the middle of the digital um of digital only thesis and all in all we're very happy to say that since February 2022 we have not only 68 students trained in closer D but also three teaching assistants that uh I think love Runner very much for her knowledge and are kind of like amplifiers for a digital fashion as well yes and additionally um just to show you where we are working because some might know so it looks to me like a general good equipped uh very good equipped University we have a Mac laab in the design faculty there IMX installed with clo and the Adobe Creative Suite and there's the C lab where we have 10 Windows computers with claw and Gerber and additionally a gerber plotter for the plotting of the patterns and the Gerber pattern digitizer yeah and in addition to that we also have of course our 3D interactive lab so this is where we design uh the experiences the interactive and the immersive experiences that uh we've been using throughout this project and other projects and of course uh we're very grateful that we have all the tools needed uh including including the let's say virtual reality sets the augmented reality sets like Holo lens like the 3D glasses we also have a holographic fan which was actually the very uh first thing that we did throughout this collaboration together and we have also some project where we use ey tracking um we do it within uh virtual reality and outside and throughout um the previous year all the students and the Tas whove been working on that project we um trained on the use of unity as well as how to connect it to uh other let's say some a bit of machine learning using Python and some scripting using C as well in this overview you see the content of the fashion technology one course where we decided to introduce cl to the students of the second semester as a tool for pattern development and does support pattern visualization and pattern understanding by simulating the digitally constructed patterns in the 3D software each semester is divided into two parts the midterm and the final um so in the midterm um the students are mostly creating the pattern under my guidance and for the final they are having a more creative approach so uh um I decided to teach CLA workflow based so first the students receive an introduction to to the user interface with a focus on pattern construction here on the left we see we now see the adoption of the Avatar with the specified construction measurement measurements and on the right you can see how the pattern was constructed uh with internal lines and traced as pattern pieces the students then sew and simulate the pattern pieces around the Avatar to create the 3D garment the pattern is fur on placed as a print layout for plotting in real size labeled with pattern annotations and will be used for the processing as a physical prototype to teach the students processing techniques for the final exam each student should develop the own design based on the basic pattern of the skirt construct it digitally in clo and visualize it on the Avatar again this adjusted pattern will be plotted and processed as a TR Additionally the students will document the workflows in a layout booklet in this overview you can see the contents of the C Pattern 2 C course which takes place in the fifth semester this course now focuses on the realistic visualization of digital garments and supports the main project also here I teach clor workflow based in the first semester the C pattern one um course the students construct patterns within the gabbas software and learn how to export a dxf file at the the beginning at the beginning of the C Pattern 2 course a dxf file of a shirt is imported into CL sewn and modeled on the Avatar according to a predefined workflow the Shir is processed as realistically as possible using layering bonding and F angles once the realistic visualization process is complete this digital garment serves as the for further development of each students's individual design thanks to my proven and inefficient workflows the students achieve a good result very quickly and enjoy the design process with design variations in club to visualize uh to visually reinforce the design Concept in the viral photo shoot I go through all the steps with the students from posing the Avatar and character design setting up an environment adjusting the lights and applying uh quality render settings in the final exam students apply the previously learned workflow independently to develop their collection vision for the main project and from now on I teach the students what they need for the realization the students can ask for the workflows they need on their own and we build up the content of the second part of the semester together in addition we work closely with the faculty of informatics and computer science to realize a presentation option for the resulting work so now we come to a more fun part we will now see some results of the C pattern two course so as you can see here the focus is not only on the visualization of a garment but also on the visual a visual conceptual staging with clone now providing stages the students are able to modify an environment quickly Aisha for example has used a color concept from her shirt in the design of the environment and lighting and is thus supporting the overall concept fita has altered her shirt by splitting the pattern pieces and assigned these with different Fabrics to create a colorful design Christy used the same shirt pattern and decided to go with elastic to create a playful look um on the sleeves NADA has placed the seamless texture with car patterns on her shirts and patched pockets in the shape of Hearts um farita used a texture tool to um for her print placement to create this blue and purple colored avenu guard look s had a similar approach and placed a floral print and julana was very excited when she found out how to do print placement variations and created these three looks for me this is a great result on how CL is the perfect designing tool especially when you have a specific product that you want to adjust for each season Jana opted for a Spacey futuristic look and placed buttons as planets floating through a spiral galaxy the SE the seethrough look also shows that she designed the Avatar with moon and Galaxy tattoos this adds another layer of design Shane was focused on creating as Rd texture to support her design also her passion for the realistic detail is clearly visible Sima has a very artistic approach and used the glitch that appeared when using the top Stitch tool as a base for her design her concept is a creepy insect and using the colorway editor Sima tried out different variations to create the look of an insector surface Malik created this virtual Editor Photo shooting this convincing makeup of the Avatar F did a great job in posing the Avatar and clo I taught the students for the posing assignment not to go too crazy but she did an amazing job here and the outcome is the wrinkles of the shirts are great Maya liked the aesthetic of adjusting the environment map and the field of view in the render settings she was able to create an interesting mixture of a real environment and a obviously digital Avatar and garment kadisha created cutouts to have a partially see through look and staged her Avatar in a galactic environment iness used the light material on her shirt to create this alienis look and staged her Avatar in a futuristic environment for environment she downloaded some 3D objects like The UU that you see here so during the midterm week I invited Luen YF an alumni of giu to Showcase her work as a virtual stylist the giu is very interested in supporting talents and former students by offering the possibility to share their knowledge and elaborate workshops this is a central Toth for knowledge transfer on both sides it is a training for the workshop leader as he or she has to organize and convey the content in an understandable way as as well as for the students who benefit from work tested knowledge it is particularly important to me to strengthen the self-confidence and to build up a community this video shows the working and atmosphere and enthusiasm of the students for the possibilities of digital fashion who photographed each other and styled their digital shirts here we see some of the results of this workshop and these are some selected Works um of the previous year in winter semester 2022 23 um these got chosen for a collabor collaborative project with faculty of informatics and computer science and I guess NADA will explain more deeply what we did here yes so so this actually is something that is very close to my heart because this is one of the very first things that we did and um we did it as a showstopper so it was in the chiro design week and we wanted to um try out if we do some kind of an immersive or an interactive display how will people react so it was like a focus group or a pilot study that we did and what we did was very simple we had um just print print outs of the shirts designed by uh the design students and uh from our side we created a very simple augmented reality application so that when you scan the design you get to see actually the uh shirts in action you get to see the colors you get to interact with them so it's the beauty of visualizing things and seeing seeing them in different dimensions and um we were actually Amazed by how people stopped how people reacted and how people um actually liked what we did and um this was one of the things that uh helped us and motivated us to start this collaboration to build uh on top of it a lot of other uh even more engaging in more interactive experiences now I would like to present a video presentation of our first digital fashion Bachelor collection at guu so okay no theine youf was immediately enthusiastic about digital fashion when I meet her for the first time during her Bachelor project I was able to support her in developing a digital fashion collection she created 12 looks inspired by the four elements water Wind Fire and Earth Lan created the sculptural outfits in CL and on her own initiative Lucine trained herself in plender and imported her garments into that software the staging and rendering was also done in blender and therefore the atmosphere in her video reinforces her design concept and artistic approach the strength of this work is sinking further into moving images than just images of digital fashion namely the staging of digital fashion immediately after oops sorry immediately after her Bachelor presentation noine was published on in the online shop of dress X this publication confirms the design deis and Scatter aesthetic of the side Guist and a wonderful first thing is that um an artistic and detached approach to Conventional analog ways of thinking about fashion is possible but a completely new approach to how digital fashion can and will be consumed so let's take a closer look at our projects at guu we teach workflow oriented and each course is structured to be chronologically meaningful and industrially applicated appable let's begin with the latest semester project which was which was initiated by Professor kalian I would like to take this opportunity to say a big thank to him recognizing his extraordinary commitment and dedication in bringing the educational Partners on board and leading this project this project centered on the development of an old collection using the codes online supervision with the educational Partners took place at regular intervals three projects were realized in which the use of Cl for design development is possible my lady Dior my missor and my muse here too the fashion design department and the faculty of informatics and computer science work together at the end of this semester the whole class was invited to Paris to present their projects to a selected di audience at the beginning of this course I gave the assignment to research dionic styles of Christian Dior and to visualize them in Clone this resed in a Dior pattern archive that is accessible to all students of the course and can be used for further design the focus here was also on understanding the proportions and silhouette so here you can see the iconic bar suit the Juno dress the mixi gown and the mstor the lady Dior stands for Elegance expression and creativity Dior itself has launched a project Dior lady art in which the lady Dior serves as a poetic canvas for artistic exploration we took up this concept and asked the students what would your lady de be and do so I created a s object of the lady di back in clo and made it available to the students as a blank canvas for their design experimentation in addition all students received the print layout in the original Dimensions to produce a real prototype the design process in CL played an important role Abba first sketched over a screenshot of the 3D bag and decided on a design approach during her consultations she then started visualizing the design in clo by exploring the color scheme and materials the image on the right shows the realized prototype and again I gave over to Nada because she was responsible for this project see here I think right now NADA is not on stage okay then I just explain quickly for her so we had these uh virtualized um lady diags and we work together with computer science um faculty and students they created AR lenses filters and lens studio and further on in unity to create um the possibility to virtually try on these bags and make luxury products like a lady dibag accessible for a bigger audience and these filters are published on lens studio and as far as I know NADA Tau me it's um more than 300,000 um users already tried out these filters but maybe she's back yes maybe you can add something n so um actually yes these filters were designed by our undergraduate amazing students from the informatics faculty and we were able to use the output of the CL uh the CL um software in order to create the Snapchat filters and um they had an amazing engagement throughout the exhibition and afterward so we've been uh let's say monitoring how the filters are acting on Snapchat and the numbers are really amazing so uh we've been able to work with the output of Cl and to integrate it through um the Snapchat API sometimes and currently we're using the same output with unity we building our own even virtual wardrobe uh from scratch so in this project the students analyze the M dress the iconic dress is known for the leverage workmanship of hundreds of embroidered silk flowers to honor this craft the approach here was also to express the craftsmanship and possibilities in a digital format at the beginning of this assignment the students chose flowers that they wanted to realize as 3D objects in CL the organic simulation in CLA resulted in great results these objects can be attached to a digital garment using trims and it was important for me to provide the impuls for this method of production so that they are not dependent on downloading 3D objects from external websites and can therefore design their own Creations KY showed as a good example for the application of Trims on the Garment as well as the use of 3D textures to visualize digital embroidery these 3D textures were created in substance sampler and you can see the texture the normal and the displacement map on the sides first has abored her Mysterio interpretation with metal jasmine flowers and youf decided to sew pattern pieces in the shape of flowers on his Mysterio um dress ABBA is an expert at creating and placing textures here she has designed a Myster dress with the concept of an underwater Garden corals are worked into the fishing net that uh make the surface of this garment n has used top stitches to give the Garment the texture of grain grass she then used fur material to depict the fine hairs of the grain for this project the students were asked to design a collection inspired by their M Doria shafik Doria shafik is an Egyptian pioneer intellectual feminist activist editor poet and writer and has been instrumental in advocating for women's rights in Egypt this project was realized in digital and physical garments in yala's design to Word Within she focused on illustrating the complex emotions and inner state that she believes Doria experienced in the last phase of her lives through Simplicity sobriety Poetics and Grace Habiba like doia shafik wants to express her Endeavor to change the stereotypical perception of Egyptian women in the world she chose Alexandria her hometown and one of doria's favorite and inspirational cities to represent the woman of the East an alexandrian lady in developing her collection Habiba referen the paintings of Mahmud site which depict alexandrian women and dresses covered by mes which is the um scarfed wrapped uh fabric around her head keny added um Pearl embroidery on her garment that represent the tears of the Nile and Na's approach is to create contrast to reflect the complexity of Doria shafi's life stages soft Fabrics paired with structured Silhouettes strong colors um mixed with muted tones and I give over to Nada now yeah so this was uh another let's say interactive experience that we designed where the idea is to showcase the uh Digital Collection in a uh in an Interactive setting and this interaction should be as subtle as possible so you don't have to wear a VR set you don't have to change anything you're just passing by the collection and it reacts to you somehow so as a first step what we thought of was to make it react to the hand movements and um one of the aims that I personally like to work on is to make things accessible to everyone so I always opt to choose things that are easily accessible by everyone like for example using simple cameras um versus using more expensive stuff so in this case we've used simple cameras that anyone can purchase anyone can use can even use your Mobile camera and um as we saw in the previous video it was able to actually interpret the hand movements and every movement had a meaning and uh accordingly the scene will react and the reaction would be either to move around this amazing white desert setting where the um amazing designs are showing it could be that to interact with a specific garment to make it disappear you make it move around um and in this case you do that only by moving your hands within the setting that you have and without having to do anything uh extra in this case this was show showcased in uh the exhibition as well and um it was really successful and we had a lot of nice feedback um and we're also doing a lot of extra work to uh what your ining so we have thanks to the amazing team a lot of progress there as well so okay now you have seen kind of like really the latest designs as really the things that have been done just a few months or weeks ago um I'm taking you back to a project that was kind of like one year earlier with uh the same students actually from the fashion design department so you can already see when when we look at the pictures right now what will happen between the approach we had here and the approach then with the project uh PR have shown just lately so what have we done with nothing left but Beauty the focus was to introduce sustainable design strategies Guided by the UN sustainable development goals um first in general and then with the focus on zero waste therefore we took a local uh collaboration with the bishara textile and garment manufacturing group also known as the bishara group um in Egypt there widely known as well as in the Mina region because they have some fashion brands called BTM and Mari Lise that have been very successful uh over Egypt and uh what we did was we received a sponsorship for dead stock using uh using to design the closes and some offcuts we used to do je jewelry you will see that later uh we did the field trip of course to the Garment Factory to collect our offcuts and dead stock and anari kollos one of the designers for the bishara group came to be guest lecturer with us um and the idea was that the students kind of like research theil waste patterns first that have been published and then they were looking for whether they go for analog approach or for digital approach and um in order to realize the garments so they were kind of like at that moment we started to realize that we're going to work with this library and that we're going to build up a library and it was zero waste Library first and the students adapted their designs to kind of like um as they used publish patterns of zero waste and then they adapted them to their concept and what you can see here for example too is that there have been a lot of analog work done as well like the fabric manipulation and the offcut jewelies what was necessary and interesting because the students then repeated the work they've done with the fabric manipulation in analog in the digital re but since this is CL academic month and not analog academic month um now here the work that actually was done in collaboration with frana and you see uh the garments uh in the in the the zero waste pattern and designs from the students but what you can see as well and this is very outstanding and frana pushed for it by presenting it before the staging and this really comes from fr's background as a artistic conceptual fashion designer she put it from the beginning on a lot of effort in that and so the students were asked for this project to do a analog fashion show but a digital fashion shoot here you see parts of this kind of like popup student uh fashion show with the analog garment and before you have seen the Garment that have been done in the digital fashion shoot then and here's a work from habba sad you can see two uh again again uh that she created this uh digital Cape that have been zero waste and you see the analog garment but you can see already too what it really makes if you put it in the digital space and again with the staging so uh for the photo shoot here we can see uh FR tried to show that there's always the figure like a real picture and then next to it is the digital picture with the Avatar so you can see how close uh already the visualization of claw comes to the like a real photo shoot actually and there again the same garment you see what staging does at that point and how important it is to not only teach the digitalization of cloth but also how you in which context you put it and how what you design around what's the lightning what's the Avatar what's the pose and what's the background here for example you can see how the students played with the camera a bit like from which perspective the camera came this is ki's work and here an interesting work as well where s s was inspired by the analog garment because she kind of like ripped the fabric apart in a lot of stripes and then suit all the stripes on a very simple silhouette in order to stay zero waste and she did this actually then in digitus so and this really created a very interesting bulky voluminous uh silhouette so yeah and here again a good example for this kind of like holistic conceptual approach not only concentrating on the pattern because far dealt with uh some stuff regarding her family and sustainability and she created this graphic and the graphic was actually embroidered on the real garment and then embroidered in digital and then used as a background for staging as well and um even before it this nothing left by yoube we wanted to show you like our first steps maybe encouraging I don't know but we thought we share this with you as well um the project was called cultivations and actually it was a project that uh was super adved by Professor Karam Jalan as well and me as a guest lecturer and francisa was too involved into the project as well as the TA maava Ibrahim and of course NADA and the uh faculty of informatics and computer science so what did we do um we went different you know nowadays it's like this you research digital and then you make analog garment this is like still the normality but we decided to kind of let go total analog inspiration we went into a museum the students uh we went into the Egyptian Museum the students there on basis of material culture approaches were asked to to look for Tool a tool to cultivate and then um they kind of like draw and describe the tool and looked for different ways of drawing the tool and dealing with the tool to find actually out what the tool is about because there was nothing written in the museum about it it was in a phase where the the museum was in transformation so it was a real research and investigation of the tool with a very individual perspective and it was outside of stereotyped iconic Egyptian history yes so it was kind of a reconnection and then from this point they started to do a digital design and this design was actually really amazing and very liberal because they were not ask it to do the pattern in real it was something that frner really tried to push them for a digital creation and this was at the end successful because um the chyo design week was for the first time approaching us uh it was a showroom called design 101 and um they were asking for something tangible to show and we were like we have something digital and they were like well we don't want to have something digital wait wait and then frana actually met NADA or I think they knew each other before but she told okay and maybe and then we come back to the famous Holan we talked about before so NADA helped uh jumped in with the whole crew and for the Cairo design week uh we could borrow the the holen and of course I mean it was amazing we got a lot of attention uh for this installation a and it was really really nice for the school and it was so nice for us to have this collaboration for the students to be shown in chairo design week so for all of us it was really a cool adventure and really a a lot of work but a great success as well okay this is almost the the final because um this is our last slide and I want to talk shortly about our vision so I would like to now highlight our vision regard of digital fashion since as an emerging work field we will continue researching and exploring the potential of digital fashion we want to enhance our collaboration between fashion design department and faculty of informatics and computer science and we are strongly interested in building up a local and a global community and Network of digital fashion designers um and therefore encourage young talents focused on the Mina region there's a big need to educate about the possibilities digital fashion has to offer to a wider audience and we want to further conceptualize a holistic digital fashion design approach n do you want to continue with the vision so um another aspect of the let's say Future Vision of things that we want to do together has to do with the integration of AI so AI is currently everywhere it's um it's a buzz word everyone is trying to use it and what we want to do and we what we actually started to do is to use AI to make our uh immersive and interactive experiences better in terms of understanding what the audience is trying to do in terms of understanding uh what interaction they're trying to do and uh we also want to make sure that the experiences that we build are more engaging are more immersive and more effective in terms of making people interact with the garments in a different way maybe H see them differently and play around with them differently as well yeah and uh we hope that we brought you a comprehensive overview of how we digitize fashion education at tiu and we're looking forward to get into communication with you and answer your questions and would like to thank all involved and supporting colleagues and students of the guu German International University and hartv University of applied sciences berin actually Francisco we thank you it was such a pleasure pleasure to to hear the the presentation thank you Dr NADA and Bianca was so insightful and was so complete so um good material that we can Inspire other schools for sure and see the great work that you are working at giu um we have some questions uh what I found super interesting too um people asked um how they can get an invitation to study at the uni I think they need to go to the website and um maybe contact our admission um they will have the the I'm not sure if it's an exchange or if it's a full program so but on the website they they will find all the contacts and all the data so it's guu D.A should I write it in the chat yeah that would be amazing if you could share with us yeah we can put it on the chat so they they know where where to find it great and U the other question that we have here from LA and um it's what program did you use for the AR yeah so we use uh unity and we use voria most of the time sometimes with ar code as well uh so it's different but we code and we design with unity this is our comfort zone yes uh if you could write on the chat as well the name of the AR program so everyone can understand it would be amazing yes thank you thank you yeah um and then um one question that I have for you because it was so amazing to see how um you collaborate fashion design and the computer science department and I can see that it's something so natural at the school because you did the presentation and it was so easy to follow both of you talking about the projects so what I wanted to ask is like what are the learnings um when you are collaborating with two departments that if we think uh 10 years ago they wouldn't probably communicate fashion design in a computer science and now it makes so much sense having both together so I would like to know what are their learnings um and the second questions would be for schools that haven't tried it out yet how would you recommend like how should they start with this collaboration the nice thing about the collaboration was as I said it was a mean to show um output differently and the time type of output that we show with digital fashion is something that is actually tangible to everyone everyone can relate to everyone can play around with and this is something that unfortunately is not always available so sometimes we work on a lot of things and then it's available only for a very limited um let's say audience or it's not something that you can actually see or interact with it Hands-On or firsthand so um this is one thing that I would advise that people would would think of that from now uh one thing that I've learned of course is I've learned a lot from working with the U design Department over the last year I've learned a lot of how um they are um very strong at showing things nicely and this is something that maybe I was I was not very strong at so uh I think that throughout the process we also learn from each other we learn um throughout the tools we learn throughout the communication we learned from the feedback so this is uh my side of of the story yeah what I like about our collaboration is that um we kind of developed the idea like with the students with the class with the staff members and then we communicate we have meetings and then we find Solutions it's just a very nice way to communicate and to find ways and it was always kind of easy to approach I have to say like I I I taught NADA hey we have this idea or we have this idea would that be possible and she was yeah yeah yeah no problem we do that and yeah I mean in the end things happen because you just start and do it and I think this is the mentality that we have that we we just start things and I think this is what you need to achieve that and not just think too much about it but try and error if it works it works and if not you something with it yeah and what I can say what I observed um seeing them both working together what actually really makes me very happy at the moment when I brought frer to this place what is actually possible is I think from program side is it's necessary to make this space and to be brave and to just leave stuff behind like honestly like not stick any longer and and just try out not not make extra space this is something possible as well but kind of like this this braveness to make it to the new normal and when there are talents that are ambitious to um change fashion and to change the curriculums and to to change the ways how we see fashion actually they all need space and that and we as the organizer of the curriculum we we need to have the conversations and make the space and the other thing what was very interesting too was that we used events a lot it was very event driven uh the moments where we thought okay now this really needs to happen or we we need something great I actually recognized that the collaboration with NADA uh is too a thing that comes at a point where we no longer sit in front of our screen but where we want to present in the exhibition Vision digital fashion and then it needs to be interactive it needs to be tangible it needs to be an experience and by focusing on the events um on certain occasions we got somehow some sponsoring at one side and on the other side um we were working towards that and then we've had the um the publication right I mean the the the attention of audiences yeah I find this um an amazing um like suggestion for who's wanting to try it out to have a goal as you said um all of the projects were even driven because then yeah you have a goal and then you create like both um departments fashion design and the computer science will together think about like and have a purpose in mind when creating so I I think this is a a really good um idea for others that want to to start um I have one last question from the audience um from ashika um I'd like to know the process of getting students started on the use of digital fashion like what would be the initial steps I actually started to show them videos and installations and content that brought me to digital fashion so um I mean there's a lot of videos and uh on YouTube that are very interesting and focused on the seam so I start mostly on just showing them content showing them output and then also I really tell them look this is a completely new working field you have great possibilities I bring for example the uh our graduate Lucine yusf um she's published on dress X right after she graduated next to um naming uh fashion designers that are already big in the markets so and this opened the eyes to from the students they were really like wow actually yes I can I can be published very fast as a digital fashion designer um because maybe now it's elaborating but at the moment there's a big need for digital fashion designers and I think the market market is not full so I think they have a very good chance to um have a career in this field and I think this is something very motivating and I think when you explain this to the students and showcase them potential outcomes and even talk about them like what are the the working fields for for using digitality because this is something that is absolutely in the developing and um yeah like a mapping of of this industry that is just now existing yeah and there's there's another fact and I think of course f as humble as she is she totally oversees that I mean of course you need really well Tred digital enthusiasts and this really made a change I think for the University because we have a lot of people um that kind of like self-educating themselves in clo 3D becoming Freelancers and are very important in kind of like carrying out jobs that needs to be done but I really M very much appreciate it that FR has this profound education like several months every day more than eight hours she told me that she kind of got lost in this digital real and that she is becoming this space and of course she's a very enigmatic person and was kind of like sharing this enthusiasm and the experience somehow I think there was a change in that it's because we had trainers before that could do somehow some clo 3D but it's not the same I mean the work she has an answer she knows the workflows she is not intimidated when something goes wrong and then she has all those kind of like references um that really really makes the difference and she can motivate because she loves this digital space herself a lot thank you you nailed it the answer um I'll make it my my words as well as you said I'm knowing the software knowing about 3D and not only about clubw but also everything that involves it right because it is a in the end a 3D program and we need some 3D knowledge as well it's really important so I I make your your words mine um and I also then we'll take this opportunity to to invite the the professors that we have here we offer training for academics um if you if you are interested you can um sign up to our newsletter um I think we can we can share the link to our newslet here and then uh we always have trainings basic trainings Advance trainings you can take part with us it will be um a pleasure so um I think it's it's time now I wanted to thank you so much um for sharing all these information with us Dr NADA francisa and Bianca thank you for coming thank you for being so humble to to share all of this with us uh it's so important uh that that we share and then we we learn with one another thank you for everyone who joined us today um thank you for the questions and one last thing um how can people reach out to you um would you like maybe to put it on the chat the link aine um contact that would be really nice so they can um access you so yes I'll put my link in and I also want to thank everyone for attending thank you for the invitation and for the very nice discussion and the questions I will add here on the chat our next um academic training that will happen at the end of the month if you'd like to join you can just check the the link here on the chat thank you everyone for joining we will see you next week you can join us um at the same time uh to see the University of Hanover of applied science and art that they will share how they've digitized the Garment of a Duke from the 16th century thank you Dr NADA also for sharing your your LinkedIn anyone that's interested you can um check their pages so thank you so much it was a pleasure have a lovely evening everyone thank you so much for having us we have been it was really a pleas pleasure thank you for inviting the giu you very very much it was really really nice to be you on stage I'm glad to hear we are the one that thank you okay so have a nice evening thank you everyone see you next week join us next week bye bye ",

        "Transcript": "hi hi can you hear and see me okay perfectly hi K hi Christian hello hello hello how are you doing good good thank you we are all excited to hear from you we have people from all over the world please write to us where you're coming from yeah hello from India armania Los Angeles welcome everyone to the third session of CLW academic month 2023 it's a pleasure to have you here thank you for coming yes write on the chat or answer to the poll where are you based right now we are just starting our third session the academic month it's happening every Wednesday uh we started two weeks ago in October 18 and it will go until November 15 every Wednesday at 5:30 p.m. so you just have to join us to hear from many universities how they have implemented claw to their curriculum and also about the special projects that they are developing like the one we're going to hear now um which is shape not size before I tell you more about the academic month let me first introduce myself my name is Fernanda um I'm academic lead at CL Europe um I joined CL in 2021 as a 3D designer my background is in fashion design but today my work is to support schools when implementing claw so from licenses to training anything that is needed so if you'd like to um start teaching Claw at your school let us know you can drop us a message if you need help with implementation as well it will be a pleasure to support you so you can see on the screen there is a contact us page you can just drop us a message and we'll get back to you very soon today with me we have Arts University bourou um I will introduce you to them very soon uh and to what we've been talking today uh first of all I wanted to talk to you about what is the purpose of the academic month so our idea is to give this stage to schools um so they can share with us how they've implemented claw we have so many great stories and we think that this needs to be shared so we can learn with one another and also Inspire the ones who are still in the implementation process this is the third edition we started in 2021 so if you are curious about it if you want to know more from other schools how they've implemented claw you can check our YouTube um page we have a playlist at it's there on the on the screen as well it will take you to all the past editions that we have done it's very inspiring I highly recommend you checking this out so we started in October 18 with Institute um we talked about pattern making if you don't know Institute of SEC is well known for their um pattern making classes and they shared with us how they've implemented CLW to these classes we know how important this topic is for the fashion industry and for the Academia so it will be it was recorded it will be on our playlist um very soon we had also last week Erasmus Plus funding three schools design school coding William the coning Academy and University of Luana telling us how they've applied for Erasmus Plus funding um with a 3D fashion education program and how they successfully got the funding so it was like a talk through their application process we know also so many people are willing to um apply so they shared with us how they managed to do it today it's shape not size with Arts University bourou they will also share how they've implemented claw to their fashion curriculum um and Professor Penelope will be sharing with us her research about how um bepoke avatars can improve inclusivity fit and sustainability I can't wait to hear all about it very soon next week an invitation for you to join us next week 5:30 the same time Central Europe time you can register here um we will hear from the German International University from kaido how they've implemented clo from scratch they will also share how they run interdisciplinary projects to motivate students and Foster 3D at the at the school then last the closing the academic month we will have Hanover University showing how they digitized a garment from the 16th century so the Garment that you're seeing now on the screen um it's a 3D of um a closing from a du from the 16th century and they will take us over how they digitized um the the patterns and how they rebu the the the duk's outfit so you see we have many different um types of presentations um join us because then you have the opportunity to ask questions to the speakers we will have a Q&A session at the end so feel free to write on the chat your questions and at the end we will um ask our speakers H last invitation if if you want to present next year on the academic months of 2024 let us know it will be a pleasure to have um have you here just drop us a message and tell that you'd like to participate and share how you've been implementing CL or maybe if you have a special project we can also share it so now um I'd like to introduce you to our speakers we have Penelope Norman she's the course leader of ma digital fashion Innovation at Arts University bourou we have Christian ostovic um he's an alumini from Au and today he's a visiting to tutor at the school and also kaida Gibson alumini as well from Au and she today is a 3D technologist so thank you so much um for accepting our invitation to to share um your research and how Au is implementing claw um Penelope what about introducing yourself and sharing with us um your work absolutely hi everybody thank you Fernanda um and thank you for all your ongoing support with us um using an implementing club which we've been doing for quite a while now um I am just going to share my screen and hopefully you'll be able to see some of our work be with me one moment so uh thank you for joining us today um as Fernand said my name is Penny and I run the ma in digital fashion Innovation here at AU um I'm really lucky in my role at AU as well that I get um time with our Innovation Studio to go out into industry and consult on the implementation of 3D creation and production methodologies um with different brands um but I'll I'll say a little bit more about me and what I do when I come on to kind of talking about uh my research in more depths but to start with I want to introduce you to both the fabulous Kyra and Christian as well so I don't know Christian do you want to introduce yourself yes hello everyone my name is uh Christian uh I am originally from Norway I've been in the UK for 10 years moved to Bournemouth to uh study fashion uh at the Art University of Bournemouth um did mens in the beginning I always been really interested in uh combining uh digital technology and fashion uh and it was a perfect university for me to go to to uh do that Implement that um and then later on uh I started working for them as a uh technician demonstrator in the beginning implementing CL into their curriculum and then um eventually doing my uh Masters in uh digital fashion Innovation uh now today I am working as a digital fashion freelancer as well as working as a visiting for um the University thank you Christian and Kyra hi everyone um I'm Kyra I also um studied fashion at AU um and I kind of picked up my love of digital fashion um from the course and also through being through covid uh kind of get thr in at the deep end um with all the closures and things um and I've not really stopped since then I'm pursuing digital fashion uh after finishing my degree I also ended up back at um Au working in the Innovation studio for a while which I'm sure Penny will pick up on later um and working on Innovation projects um with digital fashion um so that's where I've kind of picked up all of my VR and uh other showroom skills that you'll see later on um and I now work as a 3D technologist great thank you Kyra so um just to sort of start and give you an overview on what it is we do um we pride ourselves here at the University for implementing digital fashion Innovation um right from the moment the students join us um the fashion landscape is changing at exponential rates and I think it's imperative that fashion curriculum acknowledges and Embraces these changes to ensure graduates are equipped to enter the enter the industry um digital fashion is playing a major role in the progression of design and Supply chains but also in how fashion is consumed and um experienced so we find it really important to make sure that our students are going out there ready for the industry that is now emerging they're studying for jobs that don't necessarily exist yet um just to sort of give a quick overview um of how we implemented cl to start with um this sort of explains again and it's it's something we use when we're talking to Industry and talking to the students obviously if you're physically sampling and fitting garments uh whether you be a student or in Industry um you are resampling and refitting a lot you're going backwards and forwards with fit models students you're using lots of fabric when you are creating your samples um um and then your grading system can be without fitting and you produce and you end up with a physical garment what we want our students on the ba to do here is run through a rigorous digital sampling and fit process so they'll still physically produce a sample they don't have to if they don't want to they can completely choose digital fashion as their pathway um and some students have done that in the past with alternative projects and not produce anything but what we pride ourselves on is the fact that the um the way way we use digital fashion the way we use clo is not just for digital fashion artwork it is actually to support um in real life garments um so students will use avatars um in cloes 3D to design to fit to sample then they'll usually produce a final sample um and then they'll have two products at the end of it they'll have a physical garment and a digital garments so they're getting twice as much um for something that is wasting a lot less we find that as a really important um kind of element to the ba so moving on from that we also have our ma in digital fashion Innovation so we were um we were one of the first universities to um integrate a full digital fashion Innovation um Master's course um and a lot of that is based around well it's Masters its research um and we encourage our students to explore and discover through both focused and critical approaches to reflective inquiry and future design practice um the course encourages and supports designers young and old of all different um ages to explore and work with Advanced Digital Technologies to interrogate and to question current fashion practice and challenge the idea of around how a product is is produced is released onto the market um we all know that's something really important and I'll come on and talk a little bit more about that shortly so the phosy of the course this is a lovely image here this is from one of our ba students at fornelius um it's still one of the images which I really enjoy sharing um because I think kind of the elements of the levels of rendering that he got to using close 3D um and then the realization of the Garment I think it's kind of you know what we want to see when we're using digital if we're using digital for real life production is that we want to see that the garments that we are working with digitally are true to life when we create them uh physically and I think this is a great example of this um part of the philosophy of the course and part of of my personal philosophy as well is obviously fashion is recognized as one of the most damaging Industries on the planet um and therefore it's critical um that designers acknowledge and attempt to address um these issues um and we feel that by harnessing digital fashion digital fashion isn't the answer to all things sustainable you know nothing sustainable there's still a carbon footprint from using a computer and rendering a product but we feel that by systematically questioning existing ideal and design methods and bringing in digital fashion Solutions we can become a better industry and that's something that we ask students to look at on the ma course as well here um students can produce any range of uh projects when they come and do the ma um whether that be fully digital digital art or whether they're looking at kind of IRL kind of solutions um the other great thing about our University is that we have our Innovation studio um so it operates as a lab for Creative Technologies and it's a place for startup and Regional Enterprise um and it's a great hub for industry industry engagement as well so within that we have 3D printing we have VR and all of these lovely other technologies that we can link in with our CL 3D um work that we do here um so students the the image on the far right there one of our students on the ma was big into gaming um and actually was creating outfits that both the Avatar could wear in the gaming world but then could also be 3D printed as um as kind of sculptures to have around around the house and accessories which is super exciting um so just a little bit kind of about what you know what what I feel and what we feel at Arts University Bournemouth is really important um is to give students the skills that they need to bridge the gap between the digital and the physical so students should be offered the opportunity to graduate with an understanding of the different realities shaping the industry extended reality is Revolution izing how fashion is consumed and experienced both digitally and in real life and Au fashion Innovation curriculum is designed to offer students the opportunity to work between these different realities while constantly questioning the economical ethical and ecological impact of their work so it's something where students can come and they can use CL 3D in collaboration with augmented reality uh virtual reality mixed reality um so it's something we really Pride on and the work that you see in the background there is work by Alan Kelly who is who has done the ma with us and I think fernander is organizing something fabulous with him to Showcase some of his work in the near future um so again another element of things that we look at on Au is demand driven and bespoke experiences this is um a website created by Michael Johnson who is one of our ma students um looking at producing on demand um you know but also a bespoke element we have bespoke opportunities in most areas of our life nowadays and we want it in our fashion experiences as well so again it's something that it's really important that students consider um say having a mixed reality and a bespoke offering is again something that's super important so the idea here was that the garments could be customized and then they would be made with um made on demand um augmented reality in web 3 again another area that where Klo is supporting us to stay ahead of the game um in our curriculum this is some work by Alex Petru um and again kind of just you know pushing the boundaries um obviously he was looking more into kind of web three and blockchain um and you know that augmented reality virtual try on Virtual fit so again something that we'd love to love to get involved with here and then just finally to sort of round up everything that we we kind of offer and use close 3D for here is um virtual reality so VR showrooms is something that we've been integrating into our curriculum um with our students from their second year on the ba when we're doing live projects um a lot of Brands now want to partner with us for live projects because obviously we we can offer them the opportunity for sort of risk-free testing um lots of people like a bit of risk-free testing and you know it's great for our students because then they get that amazing collaboration with industry and they're able to you know try all of this um again this is from Ruth tavin's um ba collection so she actually created all of these garments in real life um as well as um creating a virtual world for them to exist so little bit of background on kind of what we do here and what we feel we do very well here with the support of Cl um and then I'm going to talk to you a little bit more about my research so as academics working um in universities we uh we we love to research and we love to find the time to research um and say something that I've been looking at is the sizing systems standardizing of sizing what's working what's not working how can we integrate digital to support with that so a little bit about me um and kind of some of the brands I've either collaborated through with um live projects or in the past um I worked for a brand called Anna Schultz for a long time celebrating um shape not size plus-sized bodies curves um that was something that was really important to me and then working at tble and Assa as well where I was able to kind of look more detailed into thepoke um digital patterns for thepoke but it kind of brought me to a place where I was getting to a stage within the industry where I I wanted to implement changes um I wanted my industry to be more more sustainable and inclusive I wanted to adopt better practice with the digital um but as many of you who work in the industry know there's not always that time for that R&D and that kind of you know testing trying new things which is what brought me to the Arts University Bournemouth um and it's one of the lovely things about being an academic in this space is that you do get the opportunity to test and then you get platforms like this where I can talk to all of you about kind of implementing new ways of working so sh not size uh the project addresses issues around fitting and how problems highlighted in traditional approaches to sizing can be addressed through the implementation of virtual fitting and prototyping more specifically This research focuses on the use of digital avatars and body scanning to improve the fit process and Challenge and enhance the existing sizing system implemented through most companies and Brands um This research was all conducted in consult in consultation with several Brands um that are at the Forefront of digital fashion Innovation from different Market sectors so ethos uh my industry career was based around inclusion of diverse body shape and fashion and it's hugely important to me that fashion is inclusive no matter what your size or shape an individual should have access to well-fitting garments that have a positive effect on mental health and confidence it's imperative that production and design are sustainable fashion is one of the worst Industries for its wasteful and damaging practices and we're not going to be able to abolish fast fashion that that's not going to happen especially in the current climate um and with the kind of attention span of us um Our Generations younger Generations we want everything quickly but what we can do is we can help the industry adopt better working methodologies to improve the processes that they are using to create fast fashion um and I do believe that by adopting digital methodologies alongside the traditional methods Brands can can make an impact in the industry um on the environment in a positive way so just to discuss quickly some of the engagement and contributors in this project um industry Consultants I worked with Sarah mole who was representing a High Street brand Tammy Bruce and Charlotte drewell who were um representing a supermarket brand Ian Archer as a creative director and educational consultant and Caitlyn Martin and Lucy goodier for a luxury Heritage UK British B brand um and then my collaboration with my colleagues um Kyra who's on the call with us today who's going to be talking about the virtual reality showrooms that we created um Jordan Cutler who supported with the VR experience as well and then of course Christian who was full support of all aspects clo 3D um so when we're carrying out research there's always a problem and we're trying to fix a problem so the motivation for the work was to use digital fashion in Technologies to address two overarching theme inclusivity of diverse body shapes in fashion and the need to adopt a more sustainable approach to the pop to the production and sampling practices um you know we have an everwing mass production model fueling Mass consumerism um and garments and clothing have become a throwaway commodity um so we need to work out what we're going to do with sorting out the problem of amassing tons of dead stock Etc um and I truly believe that programs like close weed can support us to be better practitioners so qualitative assumptions dead stock is accumulating at alarming rates um we we should all be aware of that producing digital garments will reduce oversaturation if we're not producing sample upon sample in real Fabrics we are going to lessen dead stock um actioning change in the sampling process not just talking about it actioning it can positively impact the sustainability of a garment um and I believe there's a place for a virtual Avatar Library addressing body diversity um within Brands product life cycles to reduce over sampling so a sustainable approach statement of a problem I apologize this image is a little blurry um green washing and dead stock why5 pound fashion is destined for landfill we know we should know everybody should know know if you don't know you do know now if you are paying a very small price for a garment it will not have been produced ethically or with any form of sustainability in mind it is just not possible and I think it's something to be really aware of um the phrase climate change sounds really rather passive and gentle when what's what I think we're talking about is a catastrophe for Humanity okay and I know that's quite a big statement Fernando I'm sure you'll love it that I'm going to say clo can stop us in our kind of approach for catastrophe for Humanity but 80% of environmental impacts can be influenced at the design stage so if we are using better technology and we are using better practices at the design stage we can really start to undo some of the damage that we've been doing um we have a responsibility as designers and consumers of fashion to adopt Greener practices um and not to support green washing so the other statement of the problem is thinking about inclusivity and diversity of body shapes um from an industry perspective speaking to Sarah mole from The High Street um here's a couple of quotes So I I spoke to a lot of people throughout this research and I've just pulled out a few quotes here that kind of support the other element of the of the problem so she said for a product development team and particularly for a patent Custer seeing each subsequent sample round on the same design of the same fit model is crucial if you're tweaking the fit of a garment and making changes to the p and it's impossible to tell if your changes were correct when you see the next sample on a completely new person and that's one of the issues we' we Face we haven't necessarily got the same fit models coming in every time because they're not available we fluctuate so again she's gone on to say I've struggled in the past to book older fit models who might be more representative of the customer we're aiming for and whose body shape might vary somewhat for someone of the same dress size um who's in their 20s or 30s if we can start to see a range of avatars freely available who represent a wide range of Ages and ethnicities I think we'll learn a lot about the way we should be grading patterns maybe in Futures brand will even change what sizes they want to offer in store I think that's a really interesting point I think kind of when we think about the sizing system we think about size 12 size 14 size but really what does that mean what does that mean to the consumer what does that mean to the person what is it mean in terms of measurements because I have to say as I will be showing you later on I've body scanned a lot of people and I've got what the ticket says they should be and the the measurements aren't matching up with how they identify so there are things that we need to be working on and things that we need to change and then you've got again the consumer perspective what about us what about the consumers as well what does the public know and understand about the process of garment production um and how this impact impacts on the fit you know if I step away from the world that I'm in um at all market levels it's clear that although there's little understanding of the production process um and the negative impact it maybe has on the Garment one thing is really really clear consumers are not happy um poor poorly fitting garments and the lack of body inclusivity in the creation of garments um and you're seeing it being publicly scrutinized on Tik Tok all the time I have a few examples here this quote I think this one always I'm so fast in Primark in general too but especially in Primark you know people are actually taking to the media say look this isn't making me feel good the way that you're sizing your garments isn't making me feel good we can go on Tik Tok all the time we can see people in news articles they go and buy a pair of size 12 trousers even from the same store and they don't fit them again all of these are the same size trousers somebody put that on Tik Tok there um they're clearly not the same size so I think what we could can kind of gather from the things that I've really tried to quickly go through is the fact that um as a brand if you sample and you have a bad fit you're going to cancel your garment or it's going to end up as dead stock um if it's a good fit you're going to produce it great that's nice and easy as a consumer if you purchase it and it's a bad fit you're going to return it again dead stock if you purchase it and it's good fit you're going to keep it keep and produce it's a cycle that we like it's something we want to try kind of work on so again some takeaways we we can understand dead stocks accumulating actioning change needs to happen producing digital garments will reduce oversaturation of product and consumers want clothes that fit so it would be dangerous for the industry to stand still and so I've spoken to a number of people in the industry again so Charlotte Treadwell who I interviewed in 2022 representing a supermarket digital patent and production manager although there is room for improvement with the accuracy of digital fitting technology I definitely see the benefits of digital fitting I can fit the product instantly after creating the pattern allowing me to review and fit portions of the Garment of a on a body form we can see a lot more variety in our models using a digital platform than we can feasibly see in real life again coming back to this brand and consumer if you provide a good fit as a brand you're going to make sales you're going to have repeat customers you're going to make a profit as a consumer you find a brand that fits you well you make the purchase you repeat the purchase brand loyalty and profit they go great hand inand good fitting garments lead to profit and brand loyalty bad fit doesn't sell doesn't buy ends up as dead stock so brings me on just to kind of give you an overview of why I'm doing what I'm doing um to my prototype Avatar Library so my main focus was to get real women into a body scanner and to look at their body shapes not their sizes their shapes I do have their data I do have their sizes but what I was interested in was their shapes I was interested in how they perceived themselves how they identified as a UK High Street size 12 so I put out a call for women saying do you identify and do you buy a UK Street size 12 if so would you like to be part of my project um and that's basically where it all started just for due diligence everybody scanned a body consent form and gave me the permission to use their um biometric data for gdpr this is really important so anybody going into any of this um thinking about kind of body scanning or anything that includes holding data it's really important to make sure that you follow due Ence and ethical procedures um so my test scan and my conversion here we go we're going to get on to using some clone now the bit you've probably been waiting for so what I was doing is I was using the SI stream uh body scanner to scan the women and then I was bringing them into close 3D to create their avatars so I could fit the garments and see see how the avatars worked um to start with it was quite a lengthy process so I would have to start by selecting a stock Avatar and then I would need to change the stance of my body scaned data um to change the stance of the stock Avatar to the body scan data um I'd then have to go in after manipulating The Stance um and then use the biometric data to manipulate the Avatar to the measurements of the body scan this was quite a time consuming process at the time um and it was I found that it was important to start start with the measurements from the top down because as soon as you moved one measurement something else moved and in fact the one of the biggest issues I had was the rise and shape of the Avatar's Boton the only available option um with the hip is the hips on the Apex and when increasing her bottom it also added millimeters to her hips and tummy so that that was kind of causing a few issues um so I was able to do that but it wasn't a quick process um and I was thinking about how can I create this more accurately luckily the lovely people at CL bought out the autoc converts um with their update so this obviously made a massive difference in the way I was able to kind of use my data um so yeah I went from having to do all of that work to being able to press one little button um which was really great so you open the file you wish to convert from the raw data um and then you can that you know it's sufficient for what we need at this stage of the project all I had to do was select the gender skin type check rigging only select where to save the file and convert and then I've got a I'm sure some of you have probably used this in the past but then we've got a lovely little video here of the conversion process um I won't go all the way through this because you can have a play with it yourself and see but it gives you a lovely at the end of it which is great there's a few things I learned along the way um a pre-scanning questionnaire um was important to do to start with um I'd like to use a wider range of Ages um the words that participants use to describe themselves became quite important in the research um and I would say that the visuals created um the women they did they did identify with those so there's a few things that I did wrong along the way as well um when you're body scanning make sure your participant has their hair up as you can see there her hair was down that was no good at all also uh scanning the scanner that we use has handles you hold on to the hand handles um if you don't then let go of the handles and point your fingers down they autoc convert will foreshorten your arms to the point of the Fist that you've made from holding the handles so you will end up getting shorter hands so there was a lot of things to consider that when we went through um so then I have my participants so I chose seven participants in the end Nam them after the day of the weeks just because it seems something appropriate to do with seven participants um I got them to describe themselves as well I thought that was really interesting because that sort of data can be shared with Brands what people actually think so they all say they're a size 12 but the words they use to describe themselves are all really dis different tall average height short curvy athletic Broad and we're expecting one size to to fit all of these women um so again that was uh I used myself I obviously had to use myself to do this you have to lead by example if you're asking people to kind of join you in something um and two of my lovely students who took part in the project as well that were happy for me to share their details so then I had my body scan data and I used clo 3D to autoc convert them um and the next thing was to get them dressed so again using CL 3D and basic blocks I started to dress them now you can see straight away I've dressed the one on the left I've moved that garment in close 3D over to the one on the right it's not going to work you can see already that we've got issues with the fitting close great for the fact that I can use the fit Maps I was able to use the pressure map so I was really able to start analyzing the data on all these women who would be picking up the same garment in a shop if they were going to a store so again looking at the lengths you know if you've got one fit model in a room you're not you can't see all of this data this is what's so great about doing this with clo 3D you're not going to see all of this data I'm not going to spend ages with all of it on the screen um but you can see the pressure Maps the fit Maps um button strain anybody that's ever worn a shirt probably has male or female we still have that pressure point across the chest so again looking at how the button strain is going to be on different shapes and different sizes length really important as well um I was lucky enough to work with um a supermarket brand that provided me a jumpsuit that they had put into production it had been through their fitting process and then I was able to take that through my fitting process as well so they provided me with the patterns and all of their graded measurements which I'm not sure how much she's supposed to share but there we go I'll go pass that quickly um and then I put the um garment onto the mannequin in black it didn't look very good because couldn't really see what I was doing so obviously changed everything around sewed it together on CL and then I was able to start looking at kind of making sure the elastic was right tightness and starting to look at the fit of the Garment um jumpsuits are always a really good one if you're working with fit because they're the hardest things to fit because you have to fit every part of them to every part of the body um again great with with clo to be able to kind of pull different pieces off the body have a look around see how the Garment is fitting in different areas again tweaking the rigging a little bit just to make sure um the avatars are stood up nice and straight um and then I think this is one of my favorite images kind of taking the jumpsuit uh on the image on the right off of the toall model and putting it on the short model um I think that pretty much sums up in one image there how standard sizing is not going to be the fix for the issues we have around making sure that we're inclusive in our fit um so again some images there of the final garment I think kind of sometimes taking the bodies away you can really highlight kind of the the fit the pressure points so all of this data is available for us to analyze if we're using clo 3D um and then using clo 3D in line with the body scanner look at all that look at all that lovely data if you get excited about data um and measure me ments as I do this is very very exciting and close 3D can communicate with all of this data when you're body scanning which is great so each of the models had their biometric data their scan and then the final model just to highlight as well um on the data I won't go into too much detail with it because it gets a little bit technical but just for example looking at kind of some of the UK sizing charts um we can see the measurements here M&S River Island lipy um the averages so the average bust 36.5 where we can see Mondays 39.5 Tuesdays 38 Wednesdays 40 40.3 30 so in fact all of their busts were bigger than the industry average is saying they should be at their size and in fact that was the pretty much all of the measurements actually came out bigger than what the industry is saying the average for that size is so I have got the answers to everything but what I wanted to do with this project was highlight a way that we could maybe start working in a different way with it there are some limitations I found it very difficult when I got up to the largest sizes so I worked with plus-size brand anah schelz who sent me size 18 and size 22 mannequins close close fine Clos size 18 stop mannequin fitted the size 18 model really well but then on the body scanning process there were real issues when I then went to the autocon convert it did very strange things to different parts of the body when the body shape was getting bigger and it didn't recognize what was happening with the body uh when it came to the size 22 both the body scan and the measurements became unstable due to the infrared scanning of the body and how CL recognized piece the the information that was obviously a little bit too big for what it was understanding it would be um so again basically the findings for the project was um well-fitting garments are going to uh reduce waste customers want better fitting garments um and Brands could use scanned avatars to both increase the improve the way they're fitting but also to um address kind of you know communication with customers if somebody can see an avatar that looks similar to them and then they can try the Garment online on that Avatar it's hopefully going to reduce returns um and now I'm just going to pass over to Kyra who's going to talk to us a little bit about how we then presented the project um so I worked with Kyra and we took this data and this information and we put it into a VR showroom so Kyra over to you hi everyone thank you Penny um so as Penny mentioned earlier we had an innovation Studio at Arts University Bournemouth um and I spent some time working on the integration of new digital Technologies into digital fashion workflows um but with a strong focus on Virtual showrooms so looking at VR and AR Technologies and how this could be achieved uh The Innovation Studio has a body scanner but it also has VR capabilities in a VRC as well uh so I wanted to create a smooth pipeline for creating virtual showroom environments to Showcase virtual garments but also visually demonstrate research like what penny has created here um so it's quite nice to see all the research put into a visual representation um so uh all the research that Penny had conducted um has gone into this showroom environment and inside this virtual space uh so after all the body scans were taken um and processed through Co through CL sorry um we started to create the virtual environment as so you can see here some of the uh production process of the environment um so I started to 3D model some of the pieces uh in 3D modeling software so here we're using Cinema 4D but you could be using any other things like blender there's plenty of options out there um and once we created this environment uh the aim was to view the final outcome in VR uh Penny's concept was to create a kind of virtual fitting room so all of these little pods would represent or be for each of the models uh so we created all these little pods which would be the fitting rooms within the space um and then created additional assets such as the little screens you'll see um and some of the other components and some of those were actually created in CL so you can create 3D objects in CL as well as as we know um and then we started to take these virtual um pieces these 3D models uh into uh other softwares um so there's again plenty out there you've got Unreal Engine Unity but here we went with um unreal and twin motion um so we started to bring through all the pieces of the set into the T motion space um and begin the texturing process uh this is where we started to notice a few of the problematic kind of components to the process so a few issues with texturing along the way and also if there's any other little problems with your 3D modeling they may be highlighted here when you start to do your texturing so you might have to go back and make a few little tweaks along the way um and once all the pieces are in here you can see the showroom start to come together uh so this was when the initial texturing was done but just before we started to add uh some of the final things like the avatars and the garments into the space uh so now you'll see the populated 3D environment um so what's really nice with using to motion um and these other softwares is that we can create a space which can have renders um taken out of the software so you could use the images to Showcase your work um we can also do walkthrough videos so we created a walkthrough video um from the environment as well um but it also can be viewed in VR so it's quite an accessible way to showcase the research um we had a popup at the university the little stand where Penny had her work on display um with a VR headset but also she's able to share this research and this environment with people uh online or in presentations like this through the images that have been rendered um but also the walkthrough videos as well so you'll just see a few images here I think we've got a few slides of them of some of the final outcomes yeah and then I think the next is the actual walks room of the showroom that you're talking about which I hope everyone's going to be be able to hear this virtual reality experience is designed to highlight the possibilities and improvements that can be integrated into inclusive fashion design and production methodologies space you are now in is the Prototype of a virtual Avatar library that is being developed using the data collected from body scans of real women these Avatar libraries would be available to Industry to utilize in the fit process from design through to sampling and production allowing Brands to make informed changes to garments and to fit different styles on different body shapes working virtually has many advantages it's reactive reduces waste and saves money you can see from this I do like a totem I have one in the background here well in this room you will see seven Avatar fit models wearing the same outfit these avatars are developed from the body scans of seven size 12 participants the jumpsuit they're all wearing has been provided by UK High Street brand as you can see from looking around the space the jumpsuit fits these women different differently this highlights the inadequacy of the current approach to size and fit adopted by industry the space is created to be an engaging visual representation of the issues faced around fit and sizing issues that also impact severely on the sustainability and waste you will see on the wall in front of the avatars a large poster this poster shows the jumpsuit on seven size D models in clo 3D fashion specific design software where the fit maps are being being used to highlight the fit the colors represented on the fit of the Garment red highlights areas of tightness and blue shows a neutral effect on the fabric this system can be used by a brand to see if there are any consistent fish issues on a range of different body shapes within a size bracket before a physical sample is produced the outcome of this project can be experienced both through the immersive virtual reality experience and also by view viewing the video recorded of the virtual showroom so yeah the work Kyra did here is absolutely amazing on kind of bringing it live and I think that's kind of one of the lovely things um about where we are at the Arts University of Bournemouth we have such great opportunity for collaboration being sort of one campus with everybody Under One Roof and we'll talk a little bit at the end just about sort of are what next stages but um we're currently currently getting very excited with some work with VFX at the moment moment as well that we have on campus so and yeah just my opportunity again to thank both Christian and Kyra for their supporting in this project as well and uh I believe I'm now going to be passing over to Christian who's going to talk to you um briefly about body scanning and bespoke pattern making because obviously in that work we've talked about body scanning we've talked about patterns that already exist but what Christian's been doing is actually using body scanning to create um um parametric and data patterns so Christian over to you thank you yes um so as Penny mentioned um I have been working with the body scanner in a quite different or quite similar way but uh with different outcomes so um as well as working on the ma and ba course uh for the last six years I also have been running uh evening courses with my uh friend Jill um we have done different types of evening courses but one of them is um clothes making so we have um anyone can sign up for these kind of 10 week courses evening courses uh at a and as part of that I get all these um uh people uh into the body scanner I scan them all um and then if you yeah thank you uh so I just start by um getting their um obj files the object files of them starting off similar to what penny has been doing by converting them all into a claw avatars um and I also take their measurements um and then I have been uh using the recipe of the uh Viner alage uh books I have adapted it kind like work with cl but I have so my background comes from more um kind of like physical patent cutting traditional patent cutting so I've been um very um trying to adapt the tral into clo so starting from scratch uh and and creating the blocks from um from a sheet of paper uh and then using the um the um the recipe from theit Al books to uh create the the blogs basically uh I've been working so throughout the three years that I've done this I've almost uh done made maybe uh almost a 100 B spoke um hip bodies blocks for uh men women and um and um they DS everything to from um size um six up to size 28 30 you have had a lot of different things and and of course along the way uh there will be challenges but I can um promise you that if you want to get really good at uh practicing your fits you should try to uh um make um 100 pairs of bespoke blocks for different um people because I'll tell you the um they are all very different but with the help of Cl um I would not not be able um to do that because with the uh fitting purposes and the um the virtual fit um elements but also just kind of like how everything um is has become more um speedy and once it's done you can print it out and the success rate so um after I have created these blocks uh all the women got a paper copy and then they uh make them up and then obviously they they convert them into other garments eventually uh but they have these blocks forever that is based on their their uh measurements and not their size so um it's just using implementing uh the body scanner to kind of create uh a body um a basb block based on their measurements not their um size and what size they uh think they go within what was quite funny though is that a lot of the women or men wanted to kind like know what size they were in but obviously this the sofm tell you what kind of size you would sit within so so it was quite easy question or answer to just say you know what this is it's your size like it's uh and I think it's defitely um part of how um how things can be implemented for for the future as well um with the way the the blocks um are created based on their measurement uh and then yeah so it's you can see kind of the process that I've gone through with all these uh different uh people I have body scanned testing in different fabrics and uh trying trying different uh strain laps and different fitting maps to to make it work and then uh doing minor adjustments on CL before I um print them out and give them to our um yeah the participants in the evening courses so yeah this is kind of like the example but um I think like the probably the biggest issue or the biggest problem is that like um I've based a uh based it on a a recipe that is meant for like a around the size 10 to 12 um woman or or man and obviously sometimes your body are just completely different and I think that kind of has been a different kind fit fit issue but um that's all Al where CL has been um most of use as well because then I can try it to do the virtual fit on on the um before I print them out but yeah great thank you Christian and yeah all these lucky people that come along to your evening classes here at AU as well and go away with their bespoke blocks it's a it's a lovely bespoke service um so yeah I guess kind of the from us iess guess maybe just some clo closing thoughts of Christian i' ask you first you know what do you think is next I mean that's part of kind of the the point of innovation and being at the University and sort of you know what what do you think next I think it's always I've always been a tri in kind of combining the traditional physical way of doing things as well as digital I would um I would question the fact of anything being digital 100% always it's I always think when I may produce my things digitally I always kind like keep in mind that this will be come and made physically as well one day so making sure that the patterns work and using my patent knowledge in in my 3D um work has always been been good I think uh looking at what might be next I think definitely um introducing AI can can be um beneficial to to the course and see how what the nii can can do um not be scared of it and but uh implementing it in the correct way I think especially within um working with um algorithms within uh sizing and and um popoke uh blocks uh I think that kind of will be definitely beneficial um because it will give um a viewer or a lot more realistic um outcome and hopefully less um waste but yeah not sure if I answered that question but think yeah I mean there's a lot of new technology and and things coming out isn't it but um I think it's just next really is the way that we make it accessible to everyone um you've got like the body scanner now which is great and we're starting to use that in ways and you're starting to see these kind of screens appear where you can see a garment over the top of somebody but if there's ways we can start to integrate maybe the body scans with a virtual garment that actually is simulated on the body kind of getting that technology there so people in their shopping experience can see that rather than just an overlaid image of how it looks rather than how it fits I think that's probably going to be some of the the next steps yeah i' completely agree with you there I think kind of augmented reality is is definitely something that the brands are sort of adopting um and I think it's something that's going to be moving forward and I think again Christine said I mean ai's been you know ai's been around for ages we can't be scared of it we've all got Siri we've got Alexa you know we've got autoc convert um but I think kind of honing and using Ai and I think it's really important that if um you know if there's any other fellow colleagues academics that are online I think kind of you know making sure that our students can sort of you know be involved in it have a conversation about it think about how they can utilize it to support better practice in the industry I think is I think is really important and I think we need to we need to embrace it um as practitioners to support this support our students so we're going to be a million times better that us with it anyway um but yeah and I think kind of the other thing I mean for me next as well it's fabric digitization I know the the great updates come out with cl um linking Ai and kind of fabric digitization and I think kind of really sort of focusing on fabric testing and fabric digitization is kind of something that I'm very much kind of looking forward to doing over the next sort of 12 months as well so yeah thank you I hope I hope I hope we we're interesting as adding to that I think it would be really interesting to see uh and it would be cool if CL could ever Implement uh virtual reality into the actual um software and kind like do real time virtual reality of the of the governments that would be really really cool to um be really part of of the fitting process and see yeah no for sure I'm sure we have um new things coming yeah yes uh so well it was fantastic thank you so much for the presentation I think we all learned a lot uh there was so many um details about it and it was nice how you Shar the process um the learnings the challenges and all that um I'm sure it's a it's a presentation that we will have to watch again and see in detail again um to to to get even more information we have a lot of questions and and also compliments many people loved it they already wrote in the chat uh saying that it was a great research um and thank you for sharing um everything with us uh we have some questions I I'll start by the question it's Luci and Trudy I think you have the same one what kind kind of scanner did you use for the project Penny um SI Stream So the the scanner was a SI stream scanner that works on infrared so it takes lots of kind of I mean the same as kind of playing Just Dance in your living room with your uh with the PlayStation um so it it was not one of the most advanced scanners um we were looking if we could kind of start rigging it up with some cameras with our VFX Department as well to get kind of more realistic um but it yeah SI stream takes good uh body data it takes a number of scans as it scans the body and then kind of gives you the the averages for those so yeah yeah and I know that some people use phones to scan the body have you tested it would you recommend or not yeah so there's an app called me360 um which I think can be really useful if um people are I was talking to um the the founder of um the fidal um just yesterday at the new codes in um London and I think kind of you know when you're creating bespoke garments if people are creating kind of digital fashion art but they want to turn it into a bespoke item I think the data that you're going to get from um me360 or other kind of phone scanning that's fine I mean that's kind of where we're going we're going to have you know the we're going to be able to create a a whole sort of bespoke library of clothing on our phones um and and I think kind of you know we're just waiting for a time when we can all have our biometric data on a QR code and go online and be able to buy garments that fit with that um but yeah I think kind of using the me360 app using anything you can is is great if you're experimenting with it and playing with it definitely yes great yeah and um one question here from Jessica have you researched the shape notot size concept through the lens of gendler's unisex Clothing Design so it's something that we have looked at as well um kind of I mean the lovely thing about genderless clothing um especially if you go back to like iyaki body map um it's you know it is kind of that one-sized fits all concept which is great as well um and that's something that I absolutely love I think it's kind of really important that Brands start to thinking start thinking about more of a one-sized fits all but for what I'm looking at with this I almost have to categorize sizing to try and create some algorithms to help the industry with standardization of sizing if we go to kind of one size fits all then obviously we don't have the sizing issue which is great but also we know that one size doesn't fit all so it's a huge area as well to to look at um and I know a lot of Brands you know CA are really great where they look start looking at kind of more sort of streamlining their sizes um and it's you know it's been done in the past um it's still being done now but I don't think there's any sort of really I don't know Christian do you have any thoughts on that I think it's um I think the the thing with this when you take away the sizing as well you are left with with shap measurements and that's kind of like what genderless can be it just depends what measurements your body kind like yeah speaks and I guess that's kind of like where if you just take out the sizing and take out kind of like the men's where and the women's where and and you kind like it's yeah you're left with something that doesn't matter what body you have you just have you base it on the on the shape of your body oh that that's great yeah and now I've been thinking about it when I saw the um the image of all the skinned bodies and how the jumsuit fit each one differently this made me think of H how will Brands um perceive this do you think they will think that they can solve the solution with on demand production so people would insert their measurements and then the Garment is created for them uh or do you think it's more in a sense of like virtual fitting so before you purchase the Garment you can fit on your avatar and see um how it looks um in your point of view which direction do you think it Brands will take um well I think quite a few brands are already kind of looking at showcasing um garments on avatars avatars that you can manipulate to your shape and size you can go on we we all love the attac website where you can go on and you can put in your height and your your body measurements and then you can visually see how that's going to fit on you um I think the industry feels that it's still a little fatty at the moment um we all know we all work in the fashion industry we take a long time to kind of change our ways and work in new ways um I think kind of you know we're already I mean having bespoke biometric data for kind of garments that are tailored to your body is I mean that's really that's quite simple in a process it's you know go to the tailor and get measured well go to the body scanner and get measured you know it's it's not it's not dissimilar it's already happening so I think that is a very easy jump and I think that's something that will be moved to especially at the kind of higher end luxury brands well they're doing it already they're kind of using people's biometric data they're using body scanning and producing kind of garments that's been happening for a while I think kind of having avatars on websites and customers using that way um of communicating and seeing if a garment would fit I'd like to see that happening I think it's going to be a little while longer before it is I think we'll probably go through the uh virtual Tri on and augmented reality before we kind of end up at that space But it's a space I'd like to he is that yeah oh fantastic no again thank you so much uh we learned a lot with you all today uh and for everyone this will be on our YouTube so you can check it again and the presentation again and if anyone wants to reach out to you um how they can contact you pay me KRA and Christian yeah do you want us to put emails in the chat or yeah that would be lovely yes emails or LinkedIn what what do you prefer Dalia is asking um if we think it will be affordable to everyone to have um his own avatar what do you think then have an avatar I I mean I actually when I was at the conference um yesterday and somebody mentioned something that so my daughter who is 12 she already has loads of avatars of of herself like she's got one in Animal Crossing she's got one in Roblox she creates outfits for them all the time um and I think kind of with the sort of marriage between the gaming industry and the fashion industry I I see it as a real sort of a real reality I I agree 100% yes this will happen even more often yeah absolutely great so thank you so much thank you everyone for joining next week we'll be here again with the German International University talking about implementation from scratch and on two weeks we will have real meets digital with Hanover University talking about how they digitized um the Garment from a dukee of the 16th century so click here to register and would be a pleasure to have you in the next upcoming weeks and thank you again so much fenny Kaa Christian it was super inspiring and we learned a lot with you thank you for having us even yeah Fernand thank you for hosting us and thank you for letting us share a little bit about kind of what we're doing we're we're really passionate about digital fashion education um and you know we we want we want to share we don't want to hide it away we want to share and we want everybody doing it because it is going to make an impact um and it's great fun 100% it's so easy to see that you're always um sharing and distributing the the knowledge so yeah it was a huge pleasure thank you so much and so have a nice evening everyone thank you for coming see you next week hope you've enjoyed the session see you thank you byebye bye ",

        "Transcript": "so hi everyone welcome this is the second session of Cl academic month it's a pleasure to have you here thank you for coming it's always so nice to see people from all over the world every week to November 15 every Wednesday at 5:30 p.m. Central Europe time we will be inviting schools to talk about how they've imp implemented claw today your curriculum uh we have so many different um topics I will tell you all about it very soon before that let me just uh introduce myself my name is Fernanda I'm the academic lead at CL Europe I joined CL in 2021 as a 3D designer specialist because my background is in fashion design and my work is to support schools when implementing claw so if you need any support with implementation or if you need need training for the professors or licenses please get in touch you can write to us it will be a pleasure to help you and today with me we have Ali from William deing Academy from the Netherlands christelle arvik um from design school coding from Denmark and also Dr Tanya um from University of lujuana Slovenia they will be telling us how they've joined forces to create a 3D fashion program and apply for Erasmus Plus funding before we start um let me just tell you a bit about the academic month so the idea of the academic month is to give the stage to schools we have so many incredible successful cases how schools implemented close to day your curriculum and we think this needs to be shared we started last week talking about pattern making uh we had Instituto seculi from Italy showcasing how they implement um close to their pattern making classes we know how important this topic is for our um fashion course in the industry this week we will talk about Erasmus Plus funding it's going to be a a bit different session it's more like an interview they will tell us how they've um applied for the funding and also all the process um from the creation of the idea to the application process on next week November 1st we have the Arts University Bourn mouth uh talking about shape not size uh so here we will have the professor Penelope Norman showing her research about how the customization of avatars can improve sustainability inclusivity and fit and they will also talk about how they are implementing Claw at the school next we have November 8th implementation from scratch with the German International University from Cairo they will showcase how they created um the CL classes and how they've applied it to the curriculum they will also share how they've created interdisciplinary um projects with other classes and to Foster 3D and new technologies and last uh on November 15 we have real Ms digital we will hear from Hanover University of Applied Science and Arts how they digitized the Garment from a Duke from the 16th century so the Garment that you're seeing on this image was done in claw um and it was a piece from a museum they will share with us all the process how they digitized and created this garment in club so you see we have many different topics join us every Wednesday from 5:30 p.m. um Central Europe time and if you'd like to present next year in the academic month please let us know will be a pleasure to have you here showing um the work you've been doing um with the software so that's all for now um let's invite to the stage Ali christelle and Dr Tanya christelle why don't you start by introducing yourself and then after we we start with the with the questions thank you very much fanda um yes hi hello everyone it's very exciting to be here and my name is Chris lovic and I am a head of fashion or program manager at design school calling and a teacher I have worked in close 3D since 2018 and implemented make sure it was implemented at the design school calling I'm one of um from the partner of organization of this me US my name is Alia from here I'm from the Netherlands from the Willam duning Academy in rdam and uh I'm a senior lecturer I am actually leading what we call at the Willam theing the stations uh my background is in interactive media and uh if you are curious what's behind me on my back this is work of uh one of the students who is working in the Mi project and I am actually representing a whole team of teachers um so I'm working closely together with Anette who is the head of fashion and with nadina mum who is actually leading the fabric station so um uh yeah that's uh a little bit about me hi my name is t I'm coming from Slovenia from Liana University of Liana uh Department of textile design and Graphics art uh I'm assistant professor teaching digital design my background is also fashion and textile design um I did my masters in uh textile design mainly but now I focus on special digital design focusing on 3D design but I'm quite new in close 3D so uh I'm glad to hear everything about close 3D and try to give that knowledge also to my students that's fantastic tya thank you let's start so what is the Miu project about so uh the Miu uh project is an EU funded project uh and it's between um coling Ved cor Academy in the Netherlands and the University of Lan and Slovenia these three uh fashion universities have gone together with Associated Partners uh from around the world some are um locally found and some are yeah internationally found and they are huge importance to the knowledge we need to have in order to say what what is the state ofthe art where are we at what is the field we're dealing in the um the whole project is about uh they kind of several strands in it and uh what we wanted to do was to make some use for digital tools so it's for Meaningful creative and responsible designed through inclusion diverse and for green transition so every time we implement or want to use uh digital tools um it has to be with either inclusion diversity and agreen transition or all three or two of them in this build go and also it's very much to strengthen European fashion students competences and job possibilities and that's both nationally and internationally so it's to strengthen um we are going to make um nine course modules U where we implement the digital Tools in a fash in a bachor fashion program and we're going to build a library from where it's open source library from where uh both Educators and students can and uh find material to for the Educators to um build or Implement uh into an existing fashion bachelor program or for students to be inspired from other students from uh from this um project here so it's uh this um project runs for three years and um we have just finished the first year we had a presentation of the uh the first development in September and the module um where University of Liana had the lead was about uh virtual prototyping and then if you look at it horizontally you can see that you got prototyping and then University Lana made one course module William did coring Academy did another and design school calling did the third one and it was all about virtual prototyping and how it can be implemented into the schools now we're on the second year and it's this second year it's um body scanning it's about size measurements and shapes so I'm very much looking forward to that presentation next week and um we have the lead at design school calling and then also at the two of universities then going to make their take on this topic and um in order for us to really uh be able to try and test uh the the last one that's about virtual reality ity augmented reality AI uh we all going to start we're going to start developing already here after well in January February we're going to start developing that and there we haveed Coran with the lead and then ul and dkd would also make their take on the same we're going to do it with the pedagogical approaches with focus on progression train the trainer skills knowledge and competences and that means that we build on each so starting out with implementing virtual prototyping then the next step step is that we um know the students now stand on this here and it's going to be the same students going through the three years so now we know exactly what they what they know about V prototyping and now the next is body scanning and once they've done that we build on like that train the trainer is that we make sure that the Educators within each School knows about these new tools and that their skills knowledge and competence um built as uh we go along I'll show you uh just three um examples from uh what we have achieved this year this is from University of Liana this is from Willam Gan and this is from uh design school calling and uh what we have done uh within each University is that we have made some tutorials that uh would be the kind of tutorials we would show or the way we show it in education in our each individual institution it's very important for us also that we bear in mind that it has to fit in into our own University therefore also there might be slight differences in the way we approach it because it's three different cultures so um not just cultures from the national educ but also from the educational cultures um this is where we are at right now as you can see we have year two we have finished our presentation we have started the body scanning and now in February we're going to start the final one and have a presentation uh later from that and there will be this possibilities to sign up through our websites as well um for a newsletter yes and I think I'll just uh start stop sharing this one here um that that's great um fantastic thank you and I think everyone could see already how you organize each work package I believe this is already part of of the application process um um and now my next question is about how the three of you met yeah uh so at this Science school calling uh we have um worked with sustainability for more than 20 years and the researchers constantly tried to find new ways of of making um progress and making it um the education relevant through um sustainable approaches as well and uh so um our our PhD she was saying how why don't we just uh try and make use of the digital tools from that point as well so we reached out to um uh Luana where we the professor Alena fight uh she has previously been a exjam student at design school calling so it's we thought okay we can see if they would be up for it and um and then also when I went to the first um academic uh class in Munich in 18 I that was a whole huge group from William deor and so I knew that they had started at the same time and also um a former colleague of mine at design schol had gone and worked there so we had some contacts some ways in to say would you like to be up for this and and uh both universities seemed very interested um at uh the University of lugana they had not yet started implementing a CL 3D or the equivalent but they have worked very much with a lot of other digital tools and they um were interested in uh in taking part of this and then in Coran we know it's a much bigger institution than we are in at coling so we thought perhaps it be a good group dynamic with big muscles and really you know like the muscles we have and the very um eager muscles they have at lubiana as well to push this forward so we and and all this uh came about uh during the pandemic uh so all our meetings in the beginning were online and we were trying to understand each other you know what's your culture like and you know when you you hear something you know you start getting ideas about what it's like and it's not necessarily the right idea you get but then you just keep talking about um what the different cultures are like in the different uh yeah institutions so um we uh we knew some people already but the big group we did not know at all and we started out online that's fantastic and I love to hear that you also met in one of our academic workshops and for the ones who doesn't know we run many um academic workshops dedicated to professors if anyone is interested it's always good to join our newsletter to know more about it we always have many schools together um learning on how to use glol so yeah I found I found it fantastic to know about it uh let's jump to the next question so what is Erasmus Plus and how to apply it I think many people that are here today wants to to know about this okay so the Erasmus Plus is um I mean there are various um areas within the arasmus plus it can be exchange of uh Educators it can be exchange of uh students and it's all within the EU and uh then it's also what we are doing here that we have a um project we're running together and we there has to be at least three countries present in uh in an Erasmus Plus three countries that uh is within the EU in this case and um and the we applied for what is what they call a key action 2 project where there's a lump some you get a lumps some of money to develop and to develop the uh and it's very much with the focus of Education uh students young people and like that and um and we uh we applied for this um threeyear funding to develop uh educational material sometimes it's uh the project could be also about research instead but in this case we're doing artistic research so we are we are doing and getting knowledge and then that knowledge we put forward uh to um so others can see so everything is open source and we have um done made an application where we tell about what is our goal what is our methods what do we want to get out of it and how do we want to assess what we get out of it so it's a very very thorough process where well described both in um the end goals how to get there but also to assess if um we got where we wanted to get in the first place so and how to apply in the more uh now let me just say one thing as well that you can also because I can see we do also have participants from outside Europe and there are also projects where you collaborate with Partners from outside EU as well just so you know that that is uh done as well and um but otherwise how to apply so uh we had the call uh that so the EU puts out a call and then you have to find the one that's the one you can uh that makes sense for you to apply under and um and then we applied uh together we um set up uh online on platform possibly Google drive or something like that where we could share our our views we had many meetings and then we um uh yeah that so that is how to apply in the shorter sense I think you have a couple of questions more dedicated jump to the next one then about the process what I see with other schools and that's why this question is here is that some schools have a huge Department with many people helping others are smaller and it depends a lot on the professor so I think it would be super nice to understand like how many people were involved in the application process because I know we have three of you representing the schools but we know that in this project there's so many other people involved and if you had a help from a Specialists for for the writing the application we are I mean we are three Partners these three uh higher education institutions you see presented here and each of us have two um two were two in each partner group so six in all and then we had a professional helping us because at design school calling uh we found out that we are very fortunate to have um a professional helping us out with the funding or at least we found out that I I don't think that they have the two other um universities so uh we had somebody who's uh there to do simply help with the applications and it was I don't I mean I can't imagine going through it without somebody telling you now you need to do this and now from knowing from experience what to do because it was quite what the uh The Specialist did for us he did it very palatable sort he was said now you need to write about this here okay and we got together and we wrote and we wrote each indiv individually institution and we got together and talked about what we written so it's a lot of alignment going on all the time and then you know at least I was a naive enough to think yes I've done this and then he would go oh no you need to write about this okay we can do that too and then but he was sort of layering it for us so we didn't have to sort of feel overwhelmed um in in the beginning uh towards the end I must say personally I was like how many more slices of this are you going to get us because it kept coming every time we delivered but so we would write and we would align and then we would write and on methods methodology research state of art what is what is the industry like right now what is out there and so on and so on and and while we're doing this as well we what we did we also had uh before we uh wrote the application we also contacted all the associated partners that we we um we would like to uh work with because we Al wanted to hear input from them to see okay uh what's in the field what's out there for us what how can you help us are you interested at all in helping us that was very important too and then of course uh you might also have to go back and talk to some of your other teachers and what they know and so on but at the actual writing it was like the six of us and the seven theme The Specialist I hope that answered your question yes absolutely yes so you had help from someone from the school that knew kind of the process about timing how long did it take from the the idea from the the concept to you get the the positive answer yes um so from the initial idea uh that started in Autumn 2020 but again with the pandemic and things take time within um education um so from uh from that until we got the positive answer we got that in August of 22 but I would like to tell you also so we had so if I break that up for you I would say that by um by June 2021 we had a positive uh feedback from both uh Luana and from Willam Dean and um and from that on we start started slowly that was just before the summer holiday and that is something we found out we have summer holidays a very different time time of the summer um but uh so that was before the summer holiday and then we we had the whole of the Autumn of 2011 to sort of get to know each other a little bit and online and actually the University of Lana they intended to come and visit the design school calling in October of 21 but again because of the pandemic we have to cancel that but in January 2022 the call came from the EU and uh from that on and then till the deadline was on March 23 so we had two and a half months approximately to to make this application and um it was um it's it was very busy towards the deadline definitely was with a lot of forth and back and aligning and making sure we had covered everything and also uh I and I mean like this could be with everything you you want to develop but in this very field where we we are jumping onto a train that's running and it's sort of taking us places that we had no idea where it could go but uh so so also we had to keep the the uh application quite sort of distinct but also open to see the possibilities that could arise along the way and I mean now just only with the the rise of AI the visual AI has has been like really exponential fast you know we we could not have foreseen that when we started out but we still knew we wanted to work with AI in one way or another so we we kept it sort of tight but open as well I remember you you saying that uh one of the requirements was to have the three universities together right this is an information that I didn't know so I think it's also important to share with the audience that when you apply for Erasmus Plus um it's important to have three three schools it's very important to look into the the different um approaches that can be done within the EU Erasmus Plus uh funding because there are many ways around this and there there's also um possibilities of having companies as partners as well so um the best thing is to really look into what are the possibilities uh if you're company uh how can you then um seek the funding and how is it done because there's not just one way that's very important to say but in in sense that you had to have three Partners we could have had more partners and I would also say that um the partners the difference if I can just take that as well difference between a partner and an Associated partner is that the Money Follows the partner and a a company can also be a partner so um so so that is the main difference in the the being a partner and being associated partner what I have also heard from uh from the Danish body of um of u e EU funding is that it's um it could be a bit fragile only being three from the start now we're very lucky we get on very well we are developing great stuff together but if one University your one partner for whatever reason will have to step out of the program or project you will have to find another one because it has to be free and then another one would have to take over and deliver the things that were already agreed so that's just something to I mean they they think we were sort of a bit living on the edge I think by only being three but we're hopeful really um valuable insights about the process now I've already um added the question what are the the main challenges about the application process process in the project itself I say the main challenges of applying is definitely time it is time consing and um it is it can add to the amount of hours you're doing already by teaching so that is definitely something to be aware of that in this window that's open from in our case the call came early January and then two and a half months months later we had to deliver that you it's good to know that you have got somebody who can actually put aside the time because it does take a long time to uh write it um I don't I don't know if I can say it's a challenge because I think we as I said we are really privil privileged we're doing very well but I would definitely recommend that people go and uh and visit each otherist universities uh when possible again it was during the P pandemic so we had to do it um online and try through um Powerpoints and words to explain each individual universities and now in Spring we went to visit uh University of Luana and um twice um we have been gathered in Denmark and uh in Spring we'll go to uh to Rotterdam to Willi the cor and and um s it's it wasn't a huge challenge but I'll definitely recommend people to um to visit each other as well to understand very well from the beginning yeah yes that's great a or do you do you have anything to add yes I think uh um what Crystal was mentioning indeed the uh you can do great work online and I think we did so um we we found a way to uh share our experiences and have regular meetings and yeah what crystal is saying I think we're we we are able to collaborate very well uh but indeed you know yeah you know all this uh like working online you can do as much so the times when we were uh meeting each other in Lana and in cing it was so it was so great because and then you get so much more work done because there are are these uh little misunderstandings when you are working online you know and uh so it's great to be able to to to to see each other and uh the other thing is I think indeed uh it's very it is very time consuming it takes a lot of time so but I think the power of our application and about our project is that we actually develop education which is needed and which is part of uh so we're working actually on a curriculum so it's very very valuable and uh and and uh yeah that's also what what I wanted to add is that we started from beginning to involve our colleagues so it's me and Nadine working on the text and writing the application but at the same time we were involving uh teachers um uh in the process and that really helps that that there is a uh yeah that they from the beginning uh were supporting uh the project and uh that it's also um yeah valuable for them as well I agree 100% And as you said yeah it is time consuming but everything that we create as time consuming right and I think the end goal is super important um like the muu ask is to create a curriculum for um fashion education in 3D so I I I think the outcome uh will be greater than the time that unfortunately we need to dedicate are there any recommendations and and tips for future applicants when we started we didn't know our languages that I think that was quite an an issue that we had to overcome because we didn't know what we're talking about exactly as Al just said working online is great but sometimes understanding each other online is quite difficult so uh when we aligned our language our terms or uh cultural issues um then it was much easier so uh maybe set at the F at first what exactly would we like to do and communicate the basics between us I think that that would be something that would be very useful at the beginning what we would like to achieve how do we do uh individually at higher institutions and and um maybe if we said this before I don't know what Chrystal aler mean about that maybe we won't spend so much time just talking and so on but it was something new for us in lublana because we didn't know close 3D so that was something that we had to catch upon a little so it was maybe much more difficult for us uh luckily we were able later on uh to uh hire to get another colle a colleague uh who she knows everything about clo 3D and she was really very very useful but before when we U making applications we didn't know much about clo 3D so really Basics communication I think that with good communication uh that we could start better but we just had have to had to set our uh our terms and our U kind of um basic um terms in education how we educate how we are um planning our year how we are planning our curriculum and so on so that would be a tip for the future applicants that's when fantastic and I think it's also super valuable that actually you three were in different stages in the implementation process have University of Lana on their first year Implement I think it it adds so much because it's always important to remember that there are different stages talking about positive impacts um what are the positive impacts of this project to the school itself and no such you the academic community whoever wants to reply oh yeah I I uh would you like to say crystal start and I will add okay good uh yeah I think there are many positive impacts of of this project uh yeah the main thing I think is that um we are able to improve our our our curriculum because in my case in my school there's also there's always limited time in education development because you're yeah busy teaching there's always limited time in preparation that kind of things and this project gives us the possibility to really rethink our education so that's the main positive impact uh so and it also gives us the possibility to uh to professionalize our staff because uh I think yeah they're not only CL but a lot of other digital tools are coming up and um uh we really uh need to uh engage with these tools and uh we have now the possibility uh to do so and by Prof professionalizing ourselves uh we uh of course uh uh give uh students uh the opportunity to to learn these tools and we give them a better um yeah we we give I think we give them uh the tools to uh yeah to uh I would say keep keep PO with the industry what is going on in the IND yeah yeah yeah yeah and um yeah maybe we a part of the project is also that we ask the students what they think about uh the project so maybe I can share the a movie of students actually reflecting on on the project amaz yes uh so I'm trying to uh share my screen with you uh oh sorry yes um yes here it is I discovered within this project which I definitely am going to use in the future is the translation from digital designing to physical and vice versa because a digital fashion is something that is important now and will be even more important in the future um but also is a really useful tool just to design in general and even though I always was a lot more of an analog designer um through this project which is something I never expected to sort of um end up as a conclusion with from this project um but through it I realized how important it is within my designing and how useful it can be what I discovered is that the 3D dimensions on a human body of like clothing can become so interesting as a sculptural um it goes even like Beyond my own capabilities that I have right now in the real world and using an online tool is really helpful with that because I don't have to go out buy fabrics and use all of that to cre try to create this 3D dimension but I can just already start working on it taking stuff out um bits and pieces putting bits and pieces back together and using like smaller details to create a contrast and that's something that I really enjoyed doing and that's also like one of the things that I will really take away from the um that that's amazing to see the students talking about it thank you so much for sharing Al yes um would anyone else like to add uh we can jump to the next question I know I think chriselle I think you had something to add no um let me add here what are the positive impacts of this project the school into the academic Community I I think um I think the positive impact and and I'm more there with what Alia said but also the at least uh it's it does strengthen um it's it strengthened what each school can do but also to the whole academic Community it also puts in place what we uh can do as fashion education so if if you look at um digital tools often or digital fashion is used for only online but we we actually because we are fashion designers we can link the two we have both the physical as also the students say the physical and the digital world we make sure what we we how it's strengthen is that the the fashion academic Community is strengthened through this I think that they can find a platform and other um institutions whether they already use clo 3D or whether they will go ahead and do it can now in this open source see at least examples of how um we are doing it and make use of it and get hopefully back to us and all together we get that much clever and um good at the things we're doing great thank you um T would you like to add anything or should we jump to the next next question which is very similar actually what is the added value to each school I think that we gained a lot of benefits uh through this uh project of course we just U maybe very important things we encourage creativity on different way uh to our students I think that this is very very important not just creativity in the sense of uh digital design but also other ways of uh working on on clothing design or communicating on very different are uh because they had to do and present uh in first in first year of fashion design um that module that that project was which was quite quite intense and uh we really started to use clo 3D this year uh we didn't didn't do this previous years uh we used cat can system for textile design but not for fashion design and that is a really big thing think for us a very good big benefit for our school that we started to use digital tool for fashion design and it's really something new uh for our school so this is um a great opportunity for all students not only to these students um involved in the project but also others in Master's uh degree or doctor degree because they see now how other students how students work with these tools and they would like to try it they would like to develop their things and I think that we make quite a big step in this digitalization in in uh design process and curriculum as well that's great yes thank you yes um crystelle or Audi would you like to add the staff and the students are lifted and and they get to know more about this and and then of course also uh the added value is to show that you can work really you can really as one of the students said as well minimize the waste you're using when you want to be creative and you can test things and you can so it's very much about also the sustainable approaches and how it that as value to each school but very much also lifting both students and and the stuff it's great yeah I think it's important indeed to also emphasize the uh the so we are exploring these digital tools but also in regarding to sustainability inclusive inclusivity and diversity and so it's not only about the tools but it is about how these tools actually uh change the field change the profession of uh of fashion and Beyond uh stretch the the the the field maybe but also really makes us uh rethink uh What uh fashion is about and I think um that that that are all that's that's all in the mix you know so uh I think that is uh um that's really the added value and then indeed to have the time to uh go in into depth into these subjects um uh yeah and all always from this creative approach um and it's great to see that students are able to use these tools creatively you know it's not about the tools it's about their creativity and what they do with it and what kind of impact they have with what they make yeah uh 100% I can't can't agree more we come now to the last question questions then we we will check the chat um the questions that we have so feel free everyone to add if you have more questions we'll have a look at them just after this one uh I think everyone wants to know at what stage is the project now just share my screen so work package so it's called work packages by the EU so that's why we go with it and rather confusingly the second work package we're working on is actually called three but that's because the work package one is the only administrative work that runs through the all the three years so our work package three is about use so where as the virtual prototyping implementation was about me I can just do whatever I want and you it's about there is actually an end user out there and how can we address that it's about body scan inclusion and diversity sustainability uh runs through it all but these are the highlighted um focus areas we have in um in this very work packages so it's all about size and measurements sustainability inclusion and diversity and we had a workshop uh uh just in September everybody got together lots of uh staff came from both um lugana and Rotterdam and we were all together for four days in Denmark where we talked about how do we work with size and shapes and what do we present to our students and this might very well be what we present because it's definitely one of some of the things we have in it at design school calling and we talked about okay what are the companies and what do they look into the sizes and the grading and then uh this is just an example from a previous student at design school college who was like saying why do I have a dress McKing that doesn't looked like a person and she then found somebody somebody to to make her own dress manquin from so those were the things we were talking about is like how can we work towards inclusion and diversity from from a from a point of view with size and shape and uh body scanning and um uh so this is the overall we have the end user in mind we need to understand uh how we can make this production more democratic as well less waste and customization perhaps we these are the ideas we have now when we walk into it and with any creative process we would be the wiser once we have and turned in this phone and found out how we can do it um and yes we will develop the courses in collaboration and we will use some methods and um Theory and um we will use the uh the tools to go with it we went for a body scan of the uh like if you haven't tried it yourself you might have tried it possibly in the airport or something like that it's very fast with the uh this the scan but of course today the uh the the scanning with the lighter on the the newest phones might might work as well for some of the purposes so those are the things we also look into so this was the um the workshop and we had a webinar uh in the middle of the um Workshop because we wanted to show uh where we were at the process and progress we wanted to show it to whoever could see it but also so we had it recorded for ourselves and to share with the teachers who couldn't necessarily come along for the uh the workshop uh I just want to tell you these are the reoccurring elements in every course module we do so there's the trainer trainer so it's training uh trainers in close now in this case in body scanning then me each institution will go to each institution and develop the module that fits with their curriculum their existing curriculum and then uh we get together and we um we uh show what we've done what what thoughts are and then we get feedback and feed forward to each other and once we've done that we develop the the final content and material and we run the course of finally so we actually execute the the course module so the same students that did the first will also have the second and the third and we get feedback from students we get feedback from teachers and for Associated partners and then we finalize what was needed what from the feedback and the feed forward is anything we need to change here and then we have a fun presentation with Partners Associated Partners stakeholders could be you participating here where you see where we're at and what we have achieved at that point so that is where we're at for now we're in the middle of our development and um and uh we'll meet up in November and show what what we have uh yeah where we're at right now and then we'll take you from there but I would also uh like to uh show our website I'm going to say that online thing can you see my screen can you see my web can you see the website good good um right so uh this is um so the project is a work in progress and so is the website very much as well uh one thing is actually one thing I found was quite funny when we wanted to make we wanted a website as soon as we could but we realized we couldn't have a website without content so we had to wait a little bit and once we had the content then now that was our first um prototype you could say of the website and now we found out oh okay things could some things could be better some things could work in a in a different way uh than what they do right now on this website you can uh read about the project you can see about the course models we have made so far and you can see I mean in this case here you see that this is clearable and this is not because this is of course this is going to be done later this uh it's going to be uh up um next year and so is the final one here but what you can do you can see you can go to the uh to the module through up here but also you there and then you can see that University of Lana they had the lead and this is theirs and then we have the B cor and design school calling and it's working progress so if you look at it now and come back to it you will see that things will change back to it the content not change is just the way you navigate so for each each uh university has made a course description that is describing you can say the why are we doing this and then it's also um how we're doing it so there's a plan as well and then there is um and these things can you click opens up and you can download it or print it whatever keep it on keep it digital if you want and you can see exactly all the ideas we had behind each Co course module where it's situated in the curriculum what is the level of the students what did they know when they started this course and so on the same exactly the same here we have for for the William deor Academy with the course desription again exactly the same we have here for the design school calling why are we doing it how are we doing it and and then there will the uh in this case un reflection is of some of the um IND you saw here where have a written student reflection you'll also see once you open this that in this this case all the courses are not of the same length because it had to fit to the existing curriculum so um I'm not mistaken but I think that the University of Liana was a five we course and then the M had eight we course and that disign school calling two weeks course that was part of a nine weeks course in all but all that is you can read about it all then we also have our own um tutorials we made you find uh on YouTube where we have this Channel and uh and it's I mean clo 3 has got so many how do I do a button how do the button hold how all of those things we have not covered we have covered what we will do in class because we don't need to add that vast amount of educational uh tutorials we are adding from the point of our um educ um our course then there's also uh you can the library and then you see we have here the um categories if you only want to see the course descriptions if you lesson PL and so on student projects you get to see all the student here you can go by um you can go by the um individual universities as well and see exactly what you want and click on that was the one that was shown before so I can click on this and say a little bit about it uh here so uh yeah so this is where the uh this is where we are right now uh using the digital tools for to add value uh together with our Associated Partners we uh work on the next level and um you can feel very free to sign up to our news newsletter we don't spam with a lot of newsletters but a newsletter could be like an event or where we at right now so feel free to sign up if you feel like that um yes and I think that was it for the sharing here recommend um signing up to the newsletters because you will always get to know about where um they are at and they always invite for some open sessions which are Super interesting the last one I participated and we have so many people from the Academia from the industry so I think it's very valuable to to sign up for this for the newsletter we have actually one question that it's very similar we have three questions that are very similar actually uh when they are asking if uh if they want to apply for Erasmus Plus do they need to be Associated to an University or can they apply as an individual not an expert on expert at all on all this but I think you do have to be part of a university or part of an organization or part of a company in order to do it but it could be that you could be say joined up to uh to to be part of it um in the sense that you don't apply but you become part of like an Associated partner instead or you could be a partner but you can't I mean as as an individual you don't apply you apply as an organization as far as I am but again I'm not an expert on all the EU ins and outs and if there are no other questions from the audience I think that's it chrisal yes I could be mistified a bit because it can seem like overwhelm in but there are templates to be filled in and it is very much write about your objectives write about methods how are you doing it and and there's I mean that perhaps was sometimes a little bit of a challenge for us because there's there's a limit to how many words you're allowed to write right so it's actually it's it's not like in necessarily if it's not like something you have to write for everyone but you have to write the exact things so there's a template and it can it's it's it is doable but of course if you have somebody to to help you when it's the first time or even better I mean if I can just say as well I think we we are all three universities and I don't mind that I hope that William conic and and University of Lana don't mind me saying this but we all just very happy and got together and did this without ever having tried to do it before so that says something either for our our hopes or how we just throw ourselves into trying something hoping we yes we can do this but of course what you could do also is to hook up with somebody who actually has tried this before and you can learn in a gentle way as well like that so that could also be a way of doing that's fantastic yes thank you uh so I I just can say thank you for today it was such an insightful session thank you for sharing um and also for being humble to share with us and with everyone thank you also for everyone who joined um would you like to add anything maybe how they can find you just say feel free to reach out you know sign up for the newsletter or contact me directly on on email you know it then we'll yeah if there's anything feel free great yes thank you AI what about you thank you thank you for for stay more I know that you have another um another event right now thank you for staying with us I know great to be here and uh yeah uh same as Crystal if you have more questions please contact us and uh yeah we uh we have events where people can participate in so and then you get informed by the newsletter so hope to hear from you great and and Tanya thank you so much uh yes I would like to thank you firstly Fernanda for uh inviting us and our all colleagues uh Crystal and Al for preparing and working on a great project and also to my colleagues in Liana and to the whole community that supports us and that we can really work very well in this digital area in sustainability diversity and inclusion so thank you all exactly no thank you it was it was a huge pleasure see you in the next um Miu session I will be there for sure and hopefully and some people of the audience also uh will join us so have a nice evening everyone thank you again next week remember we'll be here again at 5:30 um p.m. Central Europe time talking about shape not size with the University of Arts Bourn mouth from the UK bye thank you everyone bye bye have a good evening ",
        "Summary": "## Comprehensive Guide to the CL Academic Month Session This guide summarizes the key points from the provided transcript of the CL Academic Month session, which focuses on implementing 3D fashion education through the Erasmus Plus funding program. This guide includes definitions, step-by-step instructions, tips, and tricks. ### Session Overview - **Host**: Fernanda, Academic Lead at CL Europe. - **Participants**: - Ali from Willem de Kooning Academy (Netherlands) - Christelle Arvik from Design School Kolding (Denmark) - Dr. Tanja from University of Ljubljana (Slovenia) - **Focus**: Collaboration on a 3D fashion program and applying for Erasmus Plus funding. ### Key Definitions 1. **Claw**: Refers to a 3D design software used in fashion education. 2. **Erasmus Plus**: A European Union program that supports education, training, youth, and sport in Europe. It includes opportunities for student and staff exchanges as well as funding for collaborative projects. 3. **Work Packages**: Segments of a project that can be managed independently and contribute to the overall project objective. ### Step-by-Step Instructions for Applying to Erasmus Plus 1. **Form a Partnership**: - Collaborate with at least three institutions, preferably from different EU countries. You may include associated partners like companies or research institutions. 2. **Define Your Project**: - Clearly outline your goals, methods, and expected outcomes for the project. Be specific about what you will achieve and how. 3. **Gather Necessary Information**: - Collect data about your partner institutions, their resources, and how they will contribute. 4. **Prepare the Application**: - Use templates provided by the Erasmus Plus program. Ensure you adhere to word limits and formatting requirements. - Address all required sections: objectives, methods, budget, etc. 5. **Submit the Application**: - Ensure that all partners approve the final application before submission. Submit before the deadline specified in the Erasmus Plus call for proposals. 6. **Follow Up**: - After submission, monitor the status of your application. Be prepared to provide additional information if requested. ### Tips and Tricks - **Start Early**: Begin the application process well in advance of the deadline to allow for revisions and feedback. - **Utilize Support**: Consider hiring a professional grant writer or consultant who has experience with Erasmus Plus applications. - **Communicate Regularly**: Establish clear lines of communication among all partners to avoid misunderstandings and ensure alignment. - **Document Everything**: Keep records of meetings, decisions made, and contributions from all partners to streamline the application process. - **Visit Partner Institutions**: When possible, visit partner schools to build relationships and understand their educational culture. - **Focus on Sustainability**: Emphasize sustainable practices in your project as this is a key focus area for many funding bodies. ### Positive Impacts of the Project - **Curriculum Development**: The project allows institutions to rethink and enhance their fashion education curricula with a focus on 3D design. - **Professional Development**: Staff members gain new skills and knowledge about digital tools, which enhances their teaching capabilities. - **Student Engagement**: Students benefit from exposure to innovative design practices, improving their job readiness and adaptability in the industry. - **Sustainability and Inclusivity**: The project promotes sustainable practices and addresses diversity and inclusivity issues within fashion education. ### Current Status of the Project - As of the last update mentioned in the session, the project is actively developing course modules focused on body scanning, measurements, and inclusivity. Workshops and collaborative sessions are ongoing to refine the curriculum. ### Conclusion This session provided valuable insights into implementing a 3D fashion curriculum through collaborative efforts and Erasmus Plus funding. By following the outlined steps and utilizing the tips provided, educational institutions can successfully apply for funding and enhance their fashion programs. For further information, participants were encouraged to sign up for the newsletter to stay updated on future sessions and resources."

        "Transcript": "welcome everyone to the first session of claw academic month 2023 it's a pleasure to have you all here thank you for coming thank you for also telling where you are from you see we have a chat we can see your messages don't hesitate to write to us it's always a pleasure to see them and we will reply to you right away today we are kicking off off the academic month with Institute of CI from Italy I have Ariana and Marco with me today but every Wednesday from today to November 15 at the same time 5:30 p.m. um Central Europe time we will be holding the academic month before I tell you more um about it let me introduce myself my name is Fernanda I'm the academic lead claw Europe I joined claw in 2021 I'm based here in Munich my work is to support schools when implementing claw um I also help with the licenses guide with trainings anything that a school needs for implementation you can count on me don't hesitate to contact us if you're interested in start teaching Claw at your school it will be a pleasure to help you can write to us today with me I have Ariana she's a pattern making um teacher at Institute ofi and I also have Marco who is a student both from Institute C and they will be sharing how high school with such great reputation in pattern making is using claw for classes before we start I just wanted to share with you a bit more about the purpose of this academic month so the idea is that every year we give this stage to the school um to share how they implemented the software we have so many great stories with schools that are doing such different projects with clo and I we think it's important to share this with our community and because by doing this uh each school can learn with each other it's the third edition uh it started in 2021 I encourage you to check the recordings from the past editions you can see this in our YouTube channel um and there we have many schools that already shared how they teach claw how they've implemented claw I highly recommend you checking this today we will have then intitute SEI talking about pattern making how they've successfully implemented to their classes on next Wednesday on the 25 October we will then hear from design school coding and partners how they've applied for Erasmus Plus funding on the week after we will have um Arts University bourou from the UK sharing with us shape not size so this is a research from the professor panelope Norman uh she will share how bespoke avatars can improve fitting inclusivity and sustainability then we have the German international school from kidu they will be sharing implementation from scratch how they designed the course and how they've implemented and clock to their fashion design program and also how they usually do multidisciplinary projects with other classes and lastly the last one is Hanover University in real mids digital they will share on 15th of November um how they digitized the Garment of a Duke from the 16th century now now it's time to bring to the stage Ariana and Marco from Institute ofi uh you can see here their web page on this link so Ariana um it's a pleasure to have you here please now and the mic is yours uh let me introduce myself I'm a Ariana suti cat P making teachers at the iny I've studied fashion design in Poly Technical here in Milan I attended the master woman's were here in is ofi and after and I been teaching cat patter makings for 10 years and in addition to this I'm a pattern maker uh for some Brands and fashion companies in this session I will tell you about these schools and how CL is a study in our courses but uh I introduce the school and a little bit a story uh Carlos SEI founded the school in 1934 in triso with the intentions to spread the sorial cultures and traditional and traditions and at the same time transmit a professional method of how they design and bring to life perfectly designed garments uh over the years the Institute has trained more than 880,000 students isi is a hub of talent in a highly Dynamic contemporary and international environment with 34 different n nationalities attending the courses uh where students can learn the SEC method and a key factor is of successful for tomorrow fashion Market uh the first training program offer um offered are the pattern making ones the the Innovations introduced to this discipline allow for the accurate Creations development and Transformations for any patterns so as tobly marry the histories of secoli with the histories and development of industrial pattern making in 1962 the school started to organize the the first time and Method analyis courses in partnership with the research office is of the most important machineries manufacturers for the clothing industry as well as a few American training school with the primary objective of promoting professional development uh it imparts the knowledge and techniques to manage our workstations a Productions line plan work cycles and calculate times and cost of production Lisa has made it possible to M elements to make a up the profession professions working within fashion brands uh to record the evolutions over time and the changing professional needs um for a pattern maker a knowledge of the manufacturing process of a garments is essential and the numbers of how dedicated to tailoring and prototyping has increased uh large bride classroom and studies equipment with all the machinery and software necessary for acquiring the secondly method the layout of the institutes has been designed to mirror the various stages of Productions that go into the designing and creating collection each part of the process is into own designer space giving the students a taste of what is uh like to work in the different departments which can be found in all of the measure fashion brands uh the prototyp is result as one of the most uh s after professional roles by fashion companies in Italy especially in the Novara area and from here is Cy project uh Novara was born H open a a school of excellence dedicated to training of prototypes and partnership with brands with the aim uh of satisfying the present and future needs for of companies of the sector fash sh sector here you can see the partner companies of the prototyping projects the at the our site and uh now I have a question for you where patter making is for istitute ofy and I explain a little bit what is for us the the paper patterns is the set of paper shapes of the elements that make up a garments at isi we have a develop um a method based on the proportionated size table between Heights and circumferences where is stats and calculations our methods give the correct proportions for making patterns the base is constructed by dividing into sector for example chest waist Hep and buttons and by means of calculations the points to create the various lines of the patterns are found um after that the basis line are checked in length and shape we can also do the same thing with the virtual model from the 2D base but asembly the parts we create the Prototype uh then we move on the editing parts to realize the style ideas by creating cats and changing the width or length measurements of the garments itself now I have a video for you in this video you can see my colleague that analyze a sketch and starting from the base modify uh the Feit about these jackets and uh create uh the reading got cat lines and insert the new label they adding all of the informations at patters like SRA lines all of that we need and he goes to make p pns and um relating on the sketch then checks the line all of the lines puty EAS and put some notches and then construct a colors and and those the test on mannequins and future modify the feeds uh finally the stitching and the entire industrialization parts for make it garments is adding to the garments to the pattern sorry uh lastly uh all internal parts such as a Pockets lining reinforced interfacing are designed let's talk about for a moment the design process that we use in the is uh studing fashion uh in at thisy is a cyclical process it means tackling all the aspect that make up the production process we start with the research we study uh of Trends and consequently the uh conception of the concept and then move on the creative parts of the collections with the study of shapes and volumes fabrics and color Resorts the interre design of the collections with sketches flat patterns and related technical sheets we then move on the patent making and prototyping Parts the development of cat and final the industrializations of the product within the courses is a slightly different way uh all these steps are deal deal with uh now uh let's look specially and specifically at how the courses are structured the first is the three years course our three years course are divided in men's wear and women's wear there is a men's and women's product H the course uh last three years and is in two different languages Italian and English the course was accredited this years as a university course in this course students discovered and study all of the discipline that necessary for the entire production process during the third year we added CL lessons for the virual prototyping Parts the course started from scratch we teach how to use the basic functions create patterns directly in 2D areas and assemble them on the Avatar each students create is or her own customized Avatar in term of both size and appearance we also add to the basic parts uh all the accessories and C customization that can make the garments as real as possible such as a zip a buttons dra uh strings piping and stop Stitch or Graphics we created the outfits and rendering path in a empty spaces or in a stage and finally also the animation the size development and the printing parts of the paper pattern for the plot we have another courses that calls Master courses there is a postgraduated courses uh this course is a one half year specialization course uh the focus on this course is on patter making prototype and cast system there is also fashion design lessons aimed at the um tasis project for the CL lectures parts uh somewhat Less in left syllabus in forward uh compare compared to the three years course but still comprehensive and not last but the Intensive um course in um prototyping uh is a special course uh the partner uh participating in the project in Novara becomes full-fledged protagonist the cooperations Begins for the planning phases to the deductive plan that come from the results of the analysis uh of the Professional Profile uh of the prototyp is currently working in each part partner companies um to continue uh with the selections phase during which each company is involved in the search for the most appropriate profile in addition uh companies um actively contribute to the training make it it even more specific and targeted TR for example we have days of V visiting and Cooperative learning inside the Prototype Department of each partner uh the supply models and materials to each participants for the making of an original prototype with the supervision of a um senior brand prototyp IST and at the end end of the academic course each company guarantees to at least three participants an internship aiming at the possible requirements the partners support The Institute in sec in financing of scholarship for the most deserving students uh for these courses the close Parts is only an introductions it's only for five lessons uh to make a students understand and how to read a patterns and how to create a virtual prototype as they actually do um in class uh the last course is the um online courses uh the um specializing uh courses in in clo uh is a shorter CL uh course that we have is only five weeks is online courses in which we see all the potentials of the software okay uh every uh many garments are designed and created at the of SEI around 8 uh and of course is thesis we have a seven around 10 capsule collections for designer to watch and uh a garments for the Cy fashion show the last video videos for you for the 4th anniversaries of the Cy fashion show here this year H five H seats were selected one for the each kid and in collaboration with some thir year students and prism Tech we created the virtual fashion show for right thank you for your attention H I leave the floor to Marco who will talk about his studies and the projects that he has created with the the claw program hello everyone I'm Marco I'm a student here in Institute of SEI and before for here I studied in an High School focused on it and then I decided to follow my passion for fashion design and choose to come here in SEI and I've done the threeyear course during the the third year we started learning about CL 3D and during lessons we started uh learning and practicing the basic tool on clo then we moved on to adding details like fabric as uh accessories and top stitches and the last part was dedicated to produce an output result which can be uh images video or printable patterns here on the screen you can see my final project for clesson this project was designed to help us uh really understand how we can combine the skills learned during the uh pattern making lesson find a way to combine it with the CL 3D features so everyone um had to choose an illustration from the past year personally I choose uh one from my second year for winter collection and then like everyone I um created the uh 3D model of the outfit drone and for that I started from a base block and then I started um making changes in order to uh have the result that I've drawn on the illustration uh here as you can see we have a um basic dress with darts on the left and then the result of my modification on the right here the we have a video that I prepared for you where I'm showing you how I um um create the image that you see in the previous um slide here as you can see I started by simulating the base garment and then I'm starting uh making changes I started from the front and uh I created a horizontal cut and then closed the breast Dart then I started creating vertical Cuts in order to uh have a different uh um fit then I adjusting some lines after that I decided to make the uh dress longer by moving the hemline and then I'm uh doing the same um modification on the back so as you can see I'm doing horizontal and vertical cuts to have the same visual effect that that I have on the on the front um here as you can see I'm using um some um tool that we have on claw uh that allow me to make changes and um cut and sew at the same time the pieces so right here I'm just as you can see um making the line smoother okay then check I like how it fit then as you can see I'm putting some uh points on the bottom part of in both the front and the back because I wanted to add some panel inside the this Cuts so as you can see uh now I'm creating a new pattern from from zero I'm doing the same thing on the front so I'm creating new pattern for the panel that I'm putting in the uh vertical cuts and I'm doing the same thing that I did in on the back and I'm simulating everything together to see the result in the last part I'm adding Fabrics so I can see the real effect of the final garment because each fac will give um different appearance uh on our look I'm also adding some um personalization like giving a little textures colors Etc so yeah that's the the final result that we have I'm stopping here I was making just little changes after that then I I decided to use clo 3D also for my um disas project and I because uh everyone at uh the end of the three-year course has to um make a thesis uh the thesis is about a collection that we have to design and then we choose three outfit from the collection and we have to create the real garment so I decided for the pattern making process to use claw instead of paper and I as you can see here I have some example on how I took my illustration from the collection and I created the um virtual um model of my design and then I was able also to um print the pattern and then um create the physical um garment here are three example on how I worked and I found it that CL helped me in this um in this step because I was able to um understand better what I'm uh I was doing because I was able to um create the pattern simulate and see if there were anything that I didn't like and make the changes um right on the 2D part and this was was really helpful for me because um I was also able to um be a little bit uh more sustainable um for the environment especially and because I used less paper and less fabric because um for example um my classmate needed to make more real um canvas garment before having the um better result I was able to do the first steps on the 3D model and then I could make less changes in the final canvas garment before making the actual one thank you Marco and Ariana it was amazing I was impressed to see the results of of your work Marco I I will start um with you and I see that you are both a pattern maker and also a designer right I in this school I studied both uh fashion design and pattern making I studied also uh sewing and so yeah um Claw is very you I found it very useful both as a pattern maker and as a designer because as a designer I I'm able to understand better what I'm drawing and especially because here in Institute of SEI we really focus in the um design part not thinking uh just at the um creative idea but also uh creating um illustrations and flats that are as uh um technical as possible so with all the details that we will um use in the pattern making process so making sure to uh draw uh garments that are as possible um the same uh that we will see on the actual garment yeah as um as a pattern maker Claw is useful as I said before because each um change that I make on the 2D part I can immediately see the result on the 3D part and then make uh the adjustment that I need as you saw also in the video I made some little changes in term of shaping line so um this is very is really helpful it's also helpful when um someone is doing a project like line so has to follow the uh collection through all the steps because uh I was also able to understand how to sew the pieces together before actually sewing them with the sewing machine yeah I I remember you told me this when we talked and I found it really interesting because you have um pattern making skills you have sewing skills you are a designer and then I really remember you saying that when you are building the 3D you're already thinking about how you will do the sewing in in real life and I found this really interesting to hear um Ariana thank you for the presentation was so nice to see um the structure of the courses and how you you prepare the classes what I wanted to hear from you is that I I saw that on the ba course they start learning CLW at the third year right and then on the master when they do the the master degree when do they start learning claw uh at Master courses we have a the last semester is the third semester because the course is during one year and a half yeah and we have our semesters um in third semesters for studying clue and we have more than 15 lessons H we're doing lessons in class and we have a uh a lot of um video that I recording for the students we doing a lesson in the class that I explain and students trying and improve their flow garments or ones and respect at the third year course uh we uh see and learn all of the functions we have a less time to doing uh the the exercise they don't have the exam for example or specific projects like Marco uh but uh they have the possibility to create their own um Tes Parts like Marco every student has this possibility yeah no um that's great and I I I see here are some questions um like and comments as well Shen um is saying that student students need to learn the craft of making and also the relation between physical and digital it's completely different 100% um Sean and and I think that's one of the reasons why some schools starts with cl not right on the first years and as C they start on the on the third year um yes we start CL uh the last year H because at the first years and the seconds we prefer to teach the students how to doing patterns by paper and at the second years we use other cat systems because we have a lot of cat system in and we divided the courses in the first second and the last year and I think that using cat system and close system uh after to learn how to create a real patterns best way to use the programs because we we knows before everything about patterns darts uh checking lines and then we can apply with programs because we have a little problems learn pattern makings and how to use the programs we have two different informations and the the people or student has a little problem to mix everything and then we decided to divide in steps uh this processing MH yeah and fantastic there there is one more a technical question let's see um maybe to you or to Marco um I just from Marella um I just would like to ask um how you manage all facings fusings and inner details of the jacket uh I can I answer the same yeah okay uh okay for the jackets uh we starting at the uh external fabrics and creating a basic patterns we um assemble the the patterns at the avatars and then uh put some interfacing and structures under uh the base one the base parts then uh I prefer to divide the lining and all of the um the fuse bow and then apply at the second time uh obviously depends if you need a garments is the first trying Canvas OR is for the final um website results depends how many ties do you need at these carment but we trying to do our best and put everything that find in your real garments because then uh at final results we can um make it a marker a print layout for the plotters that we plot all of our patterns directly at the clo we put small ones notches everything that we need for the industrialization Parts obviously and then make it print layouts and plot them to paper yeah yeah yeah exactly and I think it's it's also important to remember that Claw is done for the fashion industry we have a sister company which is Marvelous Designer marvelous is um dedicated to the film industry so of course there um the tech the TCH pack seam allowance this is not taken in consideration but for cl this is very important so we can add seam allowances which is super important The Notches you can see the print layout uh so I have a question from ANA she she's asking and I think we've already answered hopefully um how we can explain to pattern makers that clo not only for designers I've come across many pattern makers who don't see the idea um of making patterns with this tool so yeah as I mentioned we have the both sides we have the 3D and the 2D window and it's they are equally important it always depends um in the user right you can use glow to design you can use glow to for doing pattern making and we had a chance today to see Marco doing the pattern um with all the required details um that that was needed um and let's see if we have um more questions that we haven't um repli to yet um yeah there is one here good work C it's a great job yeah nice thank you for the all nice nice messages um yeah and one thing that I also um uh remember Ariana when we talked uh is that you gave the example of our students that I think that she draw a um some trousers in the wrong proportion and then he ended up was a 10 meter yes yes sometimes I I few days ago we talking about the students and programs and I say that sometimes my students H has a problem with the uh measurements at the programs because it's a not so easy understand the proportions about our patterns in a programs or computers and then made an example that one students constructed a trouser that is 10 m longer but in our program in our computers is only 30 cm is okay I can see everything is a proportional but okay but you have 10 meters trousers okay you can do everything yes you can do everything but um you can create your your patterns directly in in clo or any other CAD systems but pay attention at the measurements and units yes yes sometimes and but not only one times happen that yeah fantastic yeah and this this probably would not happen with chloride we have the in the 2D for example we have the this the Avatar in a one to one measure so if you do a huge pattern you see that there's something wrong yeah and the same things happen when you changing some measurements about the Avatar and you make some made to measure a and wants to doing patterns on that and you immediately understand that if your uh garment is not fit very well because when we doing something so thiny so slim at a bodies that has a a biggest circumferences we can understand immediately if your garments not okay uh pends at Fabrics you can changeing Fabrics at your library and put a wool or um Jersey a different Jersey or elastic garments elastic Fabrics you can see immediately the difference between these garment that garments with a different Fabrics yeah fantastic okay so yes um ah that's a good one what advice would you give for those that are teaching claw I suggest to take a lot of patience a lot of passions and uh for example in my lessons I divided all of the lessons in a different topics uh I made an examp an easy example I divided for example the first Parts in a navigation selections how to move in a 3D Parts because probably the students use other graphic programs but they they has only 2D Dimensions okay and moving in a 3D Parts is not so easy for the students at the first time and at the first month and I divided another lessons in how to construct patterns how to modify the patterns or for example uh a different lessons to uh using accessory button zip and top Stitch or piping and binding okay I prefer to divide it in a little topics uh because if we ex explain a lot of times student forgot everything there's a shorters and um shorter explanations the best ways to teach something for me obviously I made a mini videos for every uh every tools at at CL I don't know if Marco like it yeah yeah it's I I agree with Ariana because um while learning how to use a program is really important to do baby steps and not do everything in the first lesson so do things slowly helps to understand really how to use the program and then another important part is practice so another important thing that um we did uh is practice practice a lot have some basic exercise for the first lessons and this is one of the best things because as always with practice comes everything so you will be um more um confident with the program yeah now 100% that that's also how I started um when I learned uh when I learned claw I thought it was easier to start with the patterns that I had ready and also with product that I already knew so I would take pictures of my paper patterns and build the 3D and then I would compare uh with my real um garment and it was amazing because it was the same and then I could use it uh the the piece to see the construction so I think this is also a great tip to to how to start if you already um work with fash and you already have some patterns then you just have to try the 3D it will not be so hard I think that's it for today thank you so much for joining thank you Ariana and Marco for sharing um for sharing your knowledge with us and your experience uh thank you too everyone that listened to us yes um and yeah so for the ones that are watching us I invite you to join us next Wednesday where we will talk about um erasmos plus funding uh we will give you some tips on how to apply and all the other sessions keep tuned on our um social media we will always be posting the the new sessions there so have a nice evening evening and Mar again bye bye bye bye ",

        "Transcript": "we have an update for our AI graphic generator this is really exciting now there are three main styles for this new AI graphic generator the first one is embroidery then we have patch and finally pop art so let's see how we get to this so what you're going to do is go to your graphic tab in your object browser there will be a magic wand you can click on that and then the popup for AI graphic generator beta will show up you can also get this through selecting a graphic and in the basic parameters there will be a magic wand there that you can select now you'll have have content type in your popup here there's a drop down and you can say style and then you'll be able to select between embroidery patch or pop art know those three types we showed you earlier or you could say none and then you won't have the defined style and cl will just like generate something you can then have a transparent background you can turn that on or off and then we have our text prompt section here where you can write in what you're imagining here is where you'll see your future graphic and then you can pop out the history and see all of the different graphics and everything that you've generated in the past in this file which is really cool within this AI graphic generator it does support all of the languages that clo provides however it is highly suggested to use English we find that it just is more accurate so here I'm going to type in my text prompt here I'm going to start to type in my prompt now you can type in as much as you'd like and of course be as descriptive as you want to be but just remember that you want to just use like simple descriptive words not full sentences and and if you want to emphasize anything you can put parentheses around them so that CL can focus on that you'll then hit generate and then it will start to generate what's also cool is you can minimize this window so you can do other things in CL and there will be a little verbage that tells you there'll be like a prompt that tells you that your graphic is ready and you'll have the cutest little graphic here and I can hit apply and as you can see it shows up in your object browser so cool and now I can just drag and drop that onto my workspace here and you can edit and adjust your graphic just as you normally would with any graphic using your edit graphic tool so cool and easy I can maximize this window again and I can generate another graphic so here I'm going to do the style option and I'm going to pick embroidery and since I'm picking embroidery I'm going to hit I have a transparent background and now I can type in a new prompt and if I add in a period then it will separate it and again you can emphasize anything with the parentheses if you want to I'll then hit generate and here I'm going to select this graphic in the object browser and hit apply and you'll see that then it'll update that graphic in your 3D window and in your object browser to this new one I can then generate again and I can keep going through until I get the graphic that I'm most happy with I also can do the pin so this will pin my prompter like the style that I like here and then I can keep generating and if you don't have an idea of what to write you can always just hit random generate and then you can just go through different random generation options and clo will like write something for you we've also updated our Avatar so partnering with Nova we now can update our Avatar's facial features so not only are you able to transform the face so so that it looks like a human but it will also adjust the facial mesh structure using AI generated facial images or prompts to create that as you can see here this is using a prompt and this is using an image file pretty amazing so let's get into how this actually works you can find this in either the Avatar dropdown Auto convert to face this is a beta feature we're just testing it out looking for um ideas and everything but everyone can use this you can also access this through selecting the Avatar and there will be a magic wand underneath the body styling and the window will come up now you have an option between prompt an image which you can select so this is the prompt and here we have the image they look a little bit different as you can see let's go back to the prompt so with the prompt what do you have so here are your options right now you can select gender we really only have female and you can also select age and ethnicity so as I said before we only have female as an option for gender for age we have quite a few options 10 years old all the way to 80 pretty great and then we have a few different ethnicities to choose from we hope to increase this list but this is what we've started with then you have your text prompt works the same as all of our other AI generations and then you have the image of the face from that prompt you also have the history that you can expand or minimize now let's go to image so for image again you can select the gender we only have females as of now and then what you can do is upload so then you upload a JPEG now please know this always works best with a clean background and good lighting lighting will change how the face looks so let's go to prompt and actually create a prompt here so now I'm going to select my age cuz I'm going to pick female my ethnicity and now I'm going to write in my prompt again be as detailed as you want the more descriptive words the better the more you can think of the better and also don't forget with our languages we support all of the clo provided languages but it is always more accurate to use English I can then select generate and if I wanted to minimize this window I could and here I've got my first phas now I could say convert and now as you see my Avatar's face has changed of course I can use my um random generation option and I can generate a image through that as well just know straight on is always better and again lighting will affect how the face looks and also like the tone of the skin and everything this feature is still in Pilot and how this works may change in the future due to the feedback we gain from all of you so know that this is still in work and we hope that it can keep on being improved and used for all of you we've made some updates to the linked editing now the official new tool of linked editing was released in a previous version but now we've made some updates to it so first instead of having to select every single line to see your linking you can now go to the toggle menu and you'll be able to show and hide all linking so you'll be able to know what's Linked In what's not a lot easier and quicker another update we've made is we've brought the rightclick unlink back in the editing tools and also in the sewing tool as well so you can just quickly have either your edit pattern tool to and select the line and right click and unlink you can do it in your edit sewing tool and you can do it in the edit link tool so all those you can unlink and Link quickly and easily the other update we've made is with   scaling and groups so here we have uh the hole and the pattern and they're linked together now when I scale this both will be scaled together because everything's linked I know great feature and we've made it watch this so if you adjust it like here it will also adjust the movements as well so it'll make it so that the hole is looking exactly the same as the cutout and everything and another really amazing update we did to help keep Precision there is the Precision boxes now work with linked editing so you can select something rightclick get that Precision box and be able to edit very precisely within CL with the linked editing it's really great and we're really happy about it and as you can see still here everything that you adjust adjusts together which really makes editing easier so we've made some updates in this patch version on selections for patterns so first let me bring in a file and I'm going to bring in this project what you'll see here in this project is there's a lot of internal lines and a lot of pattern outlines broken up now here I want to just select those three internal lines a lot of times this happens you select them but then you have to deselect those segment lines and everything well we've made an update now holding down control you can make just specific selections so instead of having to have everything within that Marquee box if you hold down control the things within the Marquee box will be selected so this is how you can get even more precise selections within CL really cool really amazing this also will work with our transform pattern tool which is even cooler so it's right now working with our edit pattern tool and if I switch over to the transform pattern tool I can again hold down control and the piece pieces inside of the Marquee box will be completely selected really amazing right again making it so selecting with and glow is even more accurate so let's talk about 2D pattern angles you ever want to know what the angle is of the corner that you're using well now in CL you'll be able to see just that here I'm going to bring in my file and now all I have to do is go to my edit pattern tool click on the points or lines or whichever and I'll then be able to see my corner my angles so you can also go to your toggle 2D toggle menu and show all lines and then you'll be able to see your angle measurements here and by just selecting the line you'll be able to see the angles as well we've updated our notches so you see here how you put a notch in your corner of the pattern there's a notch on the each side and you're kind of like well that's not exactly what I wanted right now you have the option of making it so that it is directly in the corner or on those two sides it's all on whatever you want all you have to do is go to your edit Notch and here I can select the Notch and I'll have this new Option with Notch placement and I can have it it centered or extend and I'm going to pick Center and now that I have centered it now will be exactly the same of what I have in the pattern here in my seam allowance pretty great right we have also updated our seam allowance here so originally you couldn't add seam allowance to a whole now you you can so here I created this hole in this pattern I'll go to my steam allowance tool and I'll just apply it to my pattern in my hole right here really easy so back in the beginning if you created a dxf pattern in another software far away from the center CL would show that and it would not automatically Center that dxf pattern now to help speed up workflows when you import a dxf like I'm about to now CL will automatically Center it inside your workspace so that you don't have to reenter anything now when I go to show grading you'll see that all of my grading lines are colored we've always had this but if I go into print layout one of the previous updates was I could then also see all my grading in different colors a great update that we were really happy to give what we've done here is we've made it so you actually have control over the colors you want as you can see in the grading tab in the object browser you can see all of the different colors and you can select them and change them out so they can be colorized to your standards and what your brand or vendor or factory or company or whoever wants those different sizes to be allowing for color coding within cloud we have made some updates to our fur settings with en Clow now you have five extra maps for fur which is really exciting now as you know the only way to check fur is to go into the render window so first I'm going to add some fur to this fabric and then go to my render window and go to interactive now as you see in the past there used to be something that just said base Maps but now that's been changed to maps and here is where you can see the additional maps for your fur we have now curl gravity bend Bend Direction and initial Direction what we can now do is add different maps to each one of these sections which I'll do here adding these extra Maps has now made it so that your fur can look even more realistic another great add-on that this has done is it's made it so that you can use substance files that have fur with in CL as well now that we have added in these additional Maps so now the fur can look more realistic for production and your workflows so we have made an amazing update where you now can do a 360 Panorama render this is going to be really great for our close set virtual showroom that we have so here brought in an obj showroom it's got four walls and everything which will be able to render out a little bit more realistically what I'm going to do is now go into my render window and in my camera properties here you'll see lens and there's default but if I do a dropdown I'll then be able to select Panorama render only now as you've seen the field of views change from 50 to 15 to 60 and also everything's in a mesh this is just to help cloes stay a little bit Speedy but if you go into the render window and you did interactive render you'll be able to see it what I'm now going to do is hit play making sure that my image and everything is up to the closet standards and guides and then I can go into closet and say virtual showroom add a space and I can choose the file that I just created so here I have it and I can open now I can bring in that space and I'll have my own personal 360 room showroom to put everything in you know how in CL you can get anti-aliasing in the image where like there's a lot of wavy lines well using image filter you can start to improve that so that there's less anti-aliasing within your render image ",

        "Transcript": "Introduction and Purpose Hello, everyone and welcome to the tutorial of EVERYWEAR. EVERYWEAR is the feature that connects creators' digital outfits to all avatars and digital spaces. \nCreators can easily optimize outfits designed in CLO and Marvelous Designer to suit digital spaces such as games, , metaverse, and entertainment through EVERYWEAR.\nThrough this tutorial, we will learn the process of utilizing EVERYWEAR for fitting Outfits, mesh optimization, rigging, UV packing, and texture baking. Getting Started with EVERYWEAR Click on the icon in the top right corner to open EVERYWEAR and \nWhen you run EVERYWEAR, you will notice the window showing up on the top right corner of the 2D window. Furthermore, you can check the polygon count of both garments and avatars in the bottom left corner of the 3D window.\nEVERYWEAR is structured with two major tabs: Garments and Materials.\nWithin the Garment Tab, users can perform the ‘Polygon optimization’ and ‘Rigging.’\nMeanwhile, the Material Tab offers features like ‘UV packing,’ ‘Texture Baking,’ and ‘Material.’ Polygon Optimization Considering the different mesh limits and capacities supported by each platform, it is crucial to optimize the Poly count of the outfit according to the desired platform. You can achieve the optimization in the Garment Tab by modifying the polygon count for your target platform.\n \nThe polygon count displayed on the right side of the ‘Garment’ in the EVERYWEAR window indicates the current mesh count of the outfit, including buttons and accessories. To see the polygon count of the current avatar, simply navigate to the ‘Avatar’ located beneath the ‘Garment.’ \nFurthermore, you can check the polygon count of the patterns and trims separately at the bottom left of the 3D window. To optimize the polygon count of the outfit, enter your target polygon count in the blank space, next to the current polygon count. Then click the ‘optimize’ button. This will adjust the outfit's polygons to align with the target polygon count you specified. Individual optimization for trims is also possible, especially when the trim or button are high-poly. For individual Trim optimization, select the Button or Trim that you used in the Object Browser. After selection, input your target polygon count in the Face Count under the LOD menu in the Property Editor. This will optimize the trim's polygons to align with your specified count.\nYou can also use trim billboarding to minimize the trim mesh count. \nSimply enter the number 2 in the Face Count or select 'trim billboarding' from the dropdown menu. The trim will be converted into an image. Please open the completed outfit project after simulation and production. We are going to use EVERYWEAR's Polygon Optimization to adjust the total polygon count of the outfit. For this tutorial, we will set the target polygon count of the outfit to 12,000. Rigging\n \nRigging is part of a 3D process of creating a skeleton structure out of joints/bones for the 3D model, which allows users to animate. \nEVERYWEAR's rigging merges the outfit with the avatar's joints, allowing them to move together. \nThis rigging process also involves weight painting, which determines how much each part of the outfit is influenced by the movement of the avatar’s joints. \nThis rigging process involves setting up and creating the controllable structure for the movement of the avatar and the outfit.\nCLO and Marvelous Designer excel in creating highly detailed and realistic clothing animations through specialized garment simulations. However, due to the large data sizes resulting from simulation-based clothing animations, they are impractical for use in games. In the gaming industry, a different optimization approach, known as rigging, is utilized to synchronize the movement of the outfit and avatar. EVERYWEAR's rigging is designed to synchronize the movements of the garment and avatar for optimal performance.\nEVERYWEAR’s ‘Rigging’ puts the clothing based on the rigging information of the avatar.\nThe avatar should have joints in a human-like form, and Rigging only works when the avatar is in an ‘A’ or ‘T’ pose. By Clicking \"Rigging-Apply\" in the Garment tab, you can automatically rig the outfit and can see the Update and Brush tools revealed.  \nOnce the Auto Rigging is complete, you'll notice that weights are applied to the outfit. This means that when you change poses, the outfit will move along with the avatar  This means that when you change poses, the outfit will move along with the avatar If you choose \"Yes,\" the simulation will run but all the rigging information will be deleted at the same time if you choose\nno the simulation will not proceed and the rigging information will be retained.\nIf you click the \"Update\" button, the outfit will be rigged again based on the current state. When clicking the Brush tool, the EVERYWEAR window will close briefly, and the Brush tool will show up at the top right corner of the 3D window.\nIn this step, we will use the Weight Brush to modify weight. This 'weight painting' distributes the weight values to ensure that the rigged outfit moves seamlessly with the avatar's motions. Weight painting adjusts how much influence each joint has on the surrounding vertices. It ensures that movements appear natural and fluid. Although EVERYWEAR automatically distributes weights referring to the avatar, it is essential to check for any areas where the outfit may penetrate or not conform accurately to the avatar's motion. If necessary, please make weight adjustments. The Weight Brush offers three blend modes: Add, Subtract, and Smooth. \nYou can switch between blend modes by pressing the Control Tab key.\nAdd increases the weight, Subtract decreases the weight, and Smooth brush averages the weights of vertices with those of neighboring vertices, effectively smoothing out the weight distribution.\nYou can adjust the Strength, Size, Focal, and Depth of the brush in the Brush Properties. Hold alt and square brackets, you can adjust the Strength that determines the intensity of the brush. Hold square brackets, you can adjust brush size. Focal determines the intensity difference between the brush's center and edges, while Depth signifies the depth of the brush's influence. \nClick the ‘Reset' button to reset the brush properties to their default values. Press the ‘Exit' button to close the brush tool and return to the EVERYWEAR window. Let's see how to modify the weight with the Weight Brush. Hold Control and click on a joint, which allows you to inspect the weights associated with the joint in the 3D view. The colors are represented in order of Red, Green, and Blue. The red areas indicate a higher weight distribution, while the blue areas indicate a lower weight distribution. The regions without color have a weight value of 0.\nYou can use these brushes to add, subtract, or smooth weight values. Furthermore, you can also apply brushes in the 2D Pattern window. Manually move the joints in X-ray joint mode by pressing Shift X or apply preset poses to check any areas that penetrate or do not follow along with the avatar's motion correctly. \nIf there are areas requiring adjustment, please fix the incorrect weights by changing Blend mode and brush properties. When you notice a specific vertex significantly differs from its surroundings, you can use the \"Hammering\" function to automatically align it with surrounding values. \nWhile holding Shift, the cursor changes from a brush shape to a red dot, allowing recognition of vertices. Keep holding down Shift and lick on the spiked vertex to apply “Hammering.” This feature is very useful to address spiked vertices or specific areas such as armpits, the bottom of pants, sleeves, and other regions that may be affected by unwanted joints. When you want to target only specific areas during weight adjustment, the ‘Joint Lock’ feature comes in handy. This feature is very helpful not only in resolving unintended joint influences but also in achieving precise weight adjustments for a complex outfit. \nSimply hold down Alt and click on a joint to Lock it. Once the Joint is locked, it will be highlighted in red. If you want to Lock all joints at once, hold Alt and right-click on any joint. To unlock a joint, hold down Alt and click on the locked joint. If you want to unlock all joints at once, hold Alt and right-click on any joint. Now, let's explore the Sculpt Brush. Press control and apostrophe key, and you will be able to switch between different brush modes.\nIf you notice that your outfit has holes or overlaps, the Sculpt Brush can help you adjust its shape. The Sculpt Brush offers two blend modes: Grab and Smooth. You can toggle between these modes simply by pressing the Control Tab. In Grab mode, you can effectively move the surface of the garment that may be penetrating the avatar or adjust layers that overlap. Use the Grab Brush by clicking and dragging over the surface; the selected area will move in response to your mouse movements. \nImportantly, the weight will remain unaffected during this process. \nSmooth mode is handy when you need to even out the garment surface or soften sharp edges. To apply this, click and drag over the desired area, and the surface will be smoothed to blend with its surroundings. Just like the Weight Brush, you have the flexibility to adjust the Strength, Size, Focal, and Depth of the Sculpt Brush according to your preferences. Please address any incorrect regions in the outfit by changing the avatar poses. Utilize the Weight Brush and Sculpt Brush we've covered to correct any issues. Once the rigging process is complete, press the 'Exit' button to return to the EVERYWEAR window.\n \nUV Packing Let's navigate to the Material tab. Navigating to the Material tab will switch you to UV editor mode. \nUV Packing is the feature that automatically lays out UVs without overlapping, allowing you to organize many UVs at once.\nUV Packing is essential to optimize texture resolution and not waste UV space. First, Let's go to EVERYWEAR's UV Packing and set the UV image size, and Seam size that determines the spacing value between UV shells. Click \"Pack UVs\" to  close the EVERYWEAR window and see the detailed settings of UV packing. In the UV packing window, you can configure and apply related options. The Packing Ratio represents the allowable error in height and width ratio for automatically placing UVs. The default value is set to 95, and you can fine-tune it within the range of 80 to 100. A value closer to 100 aims to position UVs as close to a perfect square as possible, though it may increase the packing time. Enabling Rotation allows for the rotation of UVs while 'Enabling fix scale Ratio' maintains the ratio between UVs while adjusting their overall size.\nWhen 0 to 1 is selected in the UV Area, the selected UVs are positioned on tile 0,0. Alternatively, using 'Selected Tile' allows you to place the selected UVs on the specified tile.\nClick the ‘Reset’ button to reset all option settings. Click the ‘Apply’ button to pack the UVs according to the specified options.\nAfter configuring the options, click ‘Apply’ to pack the entire UV. If you need to utilize multiple UV tiles based on the garment and purpose, you can select the desired pattern in the UV editor and click Apply for individual packing.\nonce the UV packing is complete,  press the ‘Exit’ button to return to the EVERYWEAR window. Texture Baking\n \nTexture baking is the feature that generates maps to represent the details of a high-poly model on an optimized model. \nThe use of low-poly models and ‘Texture Baking’ is essential because the low-poly models have smaller data sizes than the high-poly models, providing an advantage in optimization. This is particularly beneficial since game engines, AR, and other platforms often face challenges when calculating high-poly models.\nBy using EVERYWEAR's Texture baking, without creating a separate high-poly model, only a low-poly model is needed to generate normal maps and ambient occlusion maps. \nA normal map is a type of texture map commonly used in real-time rendering for games and other interactive platforms to represent high-resolution surface details on a low-resolution model without increasing polygon counts.\n An Ambient occlusion map is a grayscale texture used in rendering to replicate indirect shadows by tracing rays from each surface on a 3D model. \nDarker areas represent less illuminated regions, while brighter areas indicate well-lit surfaces. This Texture map enhances realism by approximating self-shadowing and imitating the effects of indirect light from the environment.\nIn the EVERYWEAR’s Texture Baking window, \ncheck Detail Normal map and Ambient Occlusion map. The Ray sample count for the AO map is the number of rays sampled per pixel. A higher count yields higher-quality results but increases processing time Click the ‘Apply’ button to generate the maps. Click on the preview to check the baked map in the 3D window.\nYou can adjust the intensity of the  normal map using the slider. The default is 100, and you can set it between 0 and a maximum of 200. Click the trash can icon to delete the map. Material\n \nYou can copy or create new materials in the Material List and simply apply them to the selected patterns. Initially, materials are generated based on the number of UV tiles, and you can right-click on a material in the list to rename or delete it.\nClick the 'Add' button to create a new material. \nClick the 'Copy' button to duplicate the selected material. Click the 'Assign' button to apply the generated material to patterns  The 'Delete' button enables you to remove a material.\nPlease note that the 'Delete' button only works when the material is not assigned to any patterns. Upload & Save\n \nAfter completing all the tasks, we will now proceed to upload the file.\nClick the Upload button at the bottom of the EVERYWEAR window. The Options window will appear, and the default settings are as follows. If you have specific preferences, adjust the options and click OK. \nYou will be directed to the Connect upload webpage. Once the 3D viewer conversion is complete on the item page, click the FBX Download button to download the garment FBX file. You can also check the converted garment in the EVERYWEAR tab on your Connect Portfolio page. \nYou can download the ZPRJ and FBX files from the item's menu button. If the Upload conditions are not valid, the following Alert items will be displayed. Save as ZPRJ\n \nOnce all your tasks are complete, please close the EVERYWEAR window.\n When you save the project in ZPRJ format, the ZPRJ will store all the adjustments and details made within the EVERYWEAR.

Click on the icon in the top right corner of your interface to open EVERYWEAR. 2. Upon launching, the EVERYWEAR window will appear in the top right corner of the 2D window. ### Checking Polygon Count - The polygon count for garments and avatars can be viewed at the bottom left corner of the 3D window. - The EVERYWEAR interface has two main tabs: **Garments** and **Materials**. ## Garments Tab ### Polygon Optimization - **Purpose**: Optimize the polygon count for the target platform. - **Instructions**: 1. In the Garment tab, check the polygon count displayed. 2. Input your target polygon count next to the current count. 3. Click the **Optimize** button to adjust the outfit's polygons. - **Individual Trim Optimization**: 1. Select the trim or button in the Object Browser. 2. Input the target polygon count in the **Face Count** under the LOD menu in the Property Editor. - **Trim Billboarding**: - To minimize trim mesh count, select 'trim billboarding' from the dropdown or enter '2' in the Face Count. ### Rigging - **Purpose**: Create a skeleton structure for the 3D model, allowing for animation. - **Instructions**: 1. Ensure the avatar is in an 'A' or 'T' pose. 2. Click **Rigging-Apply** in the Garment tab to automatically rig the outfit. 3. After auto rigging, use the Update and Brush tools for adjustments. - **Weight Painting**: - To ensure natural movement, check and modify weight distributions using the Weight Brush. - Use the following blend modes: - **Add**: Increases weight. - **Subtract**: Decreases weight. - **Smooth**: Averages weights of neighboring vertices. - **Brush Properties**: - Adjust **Strength**, **Size**, **Focal**, and **Depth**. - Use **Reset** to return to default brush properties and **Exit** to close the brush tool. ### Weight Inspection and Adjustment - Hold Control and click on a joint to inspect associated weights. - Use the **Hammering** function to align spiked vertices (hold Shift and click on the vertex). - **Joint Lock**: Hold Alt and click to lock/unlock joints for precise weight adjustments. ### Sculpt Brush - **Switching Brush Modes**: Press Control and Apostrophe key to toggle between brush modes. - **Blend Modes**: Use **Grab** to move garment surfaces and **Smooth** to even out surface areas. ## Material Tab ### UV Packing - **Purpose**: Automatically arrange UVs without overlap for efficient texture resolution. - **Instructions**: 1. Navigate to the Material tab to enter UV editor mode. 2. Set the UV image size and seam size. 3. Click **Pack UVs** to access detailed UV packing settings. - **Settings**: - Adjust **Packing Ratio**, enable **Rotation**, and **Fix Scale Ratio** as needed. - Click **Apply** after configuring options to pack UVs. ### Texture Baking - **Purpose**: Generate maps to represent high-poly details on a low-poly model. - **Instructions**: 1. Enable **Detail Normal map** and **Ambient Occlusion map** in the Texture Baking window. 2. Set the **Ray sample count** for the AO map. 3. Click **Apply** to generate the maps and check previews. ### Material Management - **Creating and Assigning Materials**: - Use the Material List to copy, create, or delete materials. - Click **Add** to create new materials and **Assign** to apply them to selected patterns. ## Upload & Save ### Uploading the File - After completing all tasks, click the **Upload** button. - Adjust default options in the Options window as necessary and click **OK**. - After conversion, download the FBX file from the item page. ### Saving as ZPRJ - Close the EVERYWEAR window after all tasks are complete. - Save the project in ZPRJ format to store all adjustments and details made in EVERYWEAR. ## Tips and Tricks - **Regularly Check Polygon Counts**: Keep an eye on the polygon counts, especially when optimizing for different platforms. - **Test Rigging Regularly**: Regularly test the rigging with different poses to ensure the outfit behaves correctly. - **Utilize Preview Features**: Always use the preview options to check your UV mapping and texture baking results. - **Experiment with Brush Settings**: Don't hesitate to experiment with brush settings for weight and sculpting to achieve the best fit. - **Save Frequently**: Save your progress frequently to prevent loss of work.
