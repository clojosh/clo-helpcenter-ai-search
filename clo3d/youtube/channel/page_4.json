        "Transcript": "hi all you clovers so my name is Phoebe and today I'm going to show you this really great feature it's custom measurements for graphics so it's going to let you have like custom measurements for where Graphics are placed within your pattern so it's really great if you need to get that information out and tell like whoever you're sharing this file with like exactly where to put that graphic on your garment and everything so really excited to show this to you let's Jump On In and have some fun while we learn okay so I've got a pretty cool soccer or football uniform over here right with some snazzy graphics and let's just think about this for a second so you put all your graphics on your Shir you love the placement they are great but you're kind of like m H how do I get like this information to my people right to all the people that need to know this right now P can't do it for you because you can't stop in the middle of a pattern so what we have done and let's switch to our 2D window is with your edit graphic tool over here you can select your graphic right click and there's this new new Option over here called custom measurements you can select that and then you can like place a point anywhere on a pattern segment like pattern outline anywhere anywhere that the graphic will that will hit the graphic and you can just click I'm going to do High Point shoulder and then you know exactly that placement so this is 6.8 29 I know it's hard to see but trust me and then also I can do the same I can right click again custom measurement I can like go down here right figure out through here just where it's at from this armhole armhole or I could do from this one this one seems a little bit more this one makes a little bit more sense I can do right from the bottom and then I'll set let's do this like one or two more times let's do the back so again with the back I can write click custom measurement I can do like Center back right click custom measurement an inch from armhole great now all of this information is down below in the property editor right cool and I can also select down here and I'm going to say like from Center back and then this one one inch armhole great all right here so I'll know exactly where it is you can you have a few options on how you want to export this out so you could go to file snapshot 2D window and you can like of course get like your pattern out lines you can show additional information right and get all all the 2D measurements you can uncheck the other things if you wanted you could also um have like a transparent background you know you have a lot of options you can also check on graphic lines so that you see like the bounding box around the graphic all of that stuff you have all these options so you can use all like this 2D snapshot to like get this information out which is really great cuz then you can put this on your pitch sheet or anything and you can see like see it's right here you can also this information will also be found if you go to file export and then you go to the techpack Jason file so that's great in the future you will be able to do the closet it will be in our closet tag pack and we'll also have it in our PRM just like not today but in the future yes and another thing I just want you all to know is that it reads it from from the bounding box of your graphic so right now that's like right up against this graphic so that's great but if it's a little bit farther away like how this circle is like here you see that it goes to the outline right not like to the center or um to the graphics Edge it goes to like the image box I know that same here with the connect but yeah we great it's going to help you like get your graphic measurements a little bit faster and easier hopefully and yeah hope you enjoy it thank you all so much for watching I hope you enjoyed the video and I hope you guys learned something fun and are excited to like put tons of graphics on garments and like get all those measurements and all of that if you have any further questions like let's just use that comment section below and we have so many CL three designers to help you out and their answer and get back to you also if you want to learn more or just like keep learning or anything like that keep on our YouTube channel there's so many great like videos and information for you and all of that so thanks so much again for watching and have fun building ",
        "Summary": "# Comprehensive Guide to Custom Measurements for Graphics in Clover ## Introduction This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to use the custom measurements feature for graphics in Clover. This feature allows you to specify exact placements for graphics on garments, making it easier to communicate with others who need to know these details. ## What You Will Need - Access to Clover software - A design or pattern with graphics already placed - Basic understanding of navigating Clover’s interface ## Step-by-Step Instructions ### Step 1: Open Your Project 1. Launch Clover and open your project containing the garment pattern and graphics. ### Step 2: Access the 2D Window 1. Switch to the **2D window** where you can view your pattern and graphics clearly. ### Step 3: Select Your Graphic 1. Use the **edit graphic tool** to select the graphic you want to measure. ### Step 4: Adding Custom Measurements 1. **Right-click** on the selected graphic. 2. Choose the **Custom Measurements** option from the context menu. 3. Click on the area of the pattern where you want to measure from. 4. **Place a point** (e.g., High Point Shoulder). 5. Note the measurement displayed (e.g., 6.829). 6. Repeat the process for other points: - Measure from the **armhole**. - Measure from the **center back**. - Specify distances (e.g., 1 inch from armhole). ### Step 5: Review Measurements 1. All measurements will display in the **Property Editor** below, allowing you to keep track of each measurement easily. ### Step 6: Exporting Information 1. **Export the 2D window snapshot**: - Go to **File** > **Snapshot 2D Window**. - Choose options for what to include in the snapshot (e.g., pattern outlines, additional information, transparent background). - Check or uncheck options like **graphic lines** to show the bounding box around graphics as needed. 2. Alternatively, you can export the information as a **Techpack JSON file**: - Go to **File** > **Export** > **Techpack JSON file**. ### Step 7: Future Options 1. Be aware that future updates will allow this information to be included in the **closet tech pack** and **PRM (Product Resource Management)**. ## Definitions - **Bounding Box**: The rectangular area that encompasses the graphic, which is used to determine the placement measurements. - **Techpack**: A document that contains all necessary information to produce a garment, including measurements, materials, and graphics. - **Snapshot**: A static image of the current state of the 2D window, capturing all visible elements. ## Tips and Tricks - **Use Clear Naming**: When adding custom measurements, use clear and concise naming for each measurement to avoid confusion. - **Double-check Measurements**: Always double-check your measurements before exporting to ensure accuracy. - **Utilize Comments**: If collaborating, use comments to explain any complex placements or measurements for clarity. - **Keep Learning**: Subscribe to Clover’s YouTube channel for ongoing tutorials and updates on new features. ## Conclusion By following these steps, you can efficiently utilize the custom measurements feature in Clover to enhance your garment design process. This tool will streamline communication about graphic placements and help ensure that your designs are accurately executed. For any further questions, feel free to reach out in the comments section or check out additional resources on Clover’s platform. Happy designing!"

        "Transcript": "hi all you clovers uh so my name is Phoebe and I'm going to show you the update that we did to modular specifically how we optimized it so that there's now only one modular library and what that means for all the old modular blocks and how it all work along with some updates we've done to our settings for modular so I know you're as excited as I am so let's Jump On In and have some fun while we learn let's talk about modular so as a lot of you might know we've optimized our modular Library 2 one so that you don't have to like figure out which one is it in it's only in one now so you can go to modular library and then you can get kids men women we already have some blocks for you you can also like bring in and create your own all of that there's a whole tutorial in-depth modular that goes through everything about it then this is how we've updated modular a bit and let's go through it with the optimized modular Library so I'm bringing in a file that actually uses the old modular Library files and I'm going to drop this in what happens you may ask well this pop-up window comes up and it's basically telling you that CL acknowledges that this file is from an older modular library and that it was modular it's still going to be modular and it's going to be loaded automatically like that okay don't be fooled though all right that that means it's going to be magically in your modular Library no you know why cuz how will we know where to put it right like what if you brought in a pair of pants and we just like automatically put it in shirts like no so you still have to put it in where you would want to find it in your modular library but close like we got you we got it like it's going to load perfectly but you've got to figure out where you want it saved so I'm going to hit okay and look at that great and everything shirt perfect now here's another fun fact if I go into settings user settings and in other right I can go to to this modular library and I can pick where I want my default folder to be so I can go to this open and when I go to save this I can do like oh it should save in my like desktop testing modular great right so like that's where my modulars will automatically go to be saved which is great for like huge companies or individual people or anywhere where you're like I just want them all saved in one space now they can be so I have this shirt and it's modular but I still need to then say like okay file save as style right and then I can go to men's women's or kids or I can add my own and you see how like it automatically went to my testing modular folder because that's what I'm telling CL this a new folder whatever select and then category add okay and then I'm going to select this style add look at that I don't know I'm not being very creative right now now block and what I can do is I can add some I can open you know the drill but I'm going to hit add front body okay back body okay sleeves collar C do I have a hem no I'm all good all right great now I'm going to go to FR front body like that enter okay back body select that enter okay sleeves enter okay collar enter Dynamite cuffs and and of course I can have like an image or anything that I want if I did create new and okay all set please check your taglines I think everything's wonderful I did such an amazing job and okay great now I go to my modular library in my practice button button it's all there also if I go into my desktop and I go to my testing modular so here's my desktop testing modular practice button down shirts here we go so it'll all go wherever it's supposed to go and all of that and now it'll be all saved but that's that's the workflow here guys pretty good you just have to pick where you want it all saved but it will all still load the old ones in and yeah and you yeah if you have any questions about it like comment section thank you thank you all so much for watching if you have any more questions about modular or how it works please use the comments below and also if you want to know more about modular and you're like now I've got to know it all check out that in-depth modular library and mode uh video that's also me so you have to listen to me again sorry um but yeah and thanks so much for watching and continue to use our YouTube channel it's got so many great videos thanks again ",
        "Summary": "# Comprehensive Guide to the Optimized Modular Library **Introduction** In this guide, we'll go over the recent updates to the Modular Library as presented by Phoebe. The primary focus will be on the optimization of the library, the handling of old modular blocks, and updates to the settings. This guide will provide step-by-step instructions, definitions, and helpful tips to navigate and utilize the new features effectively. ### 1. Overview of the Modular Library **Definition:** The Modular Library is a collection of modular blocks used to create clothing designs. The recent optimization simplifies the process by consolidating all modular components into a single library. ### 2. Key Updates - **Single Modular Library:** - Previously, users had to navigate between multiple modular libraries. Now, there is only one consolidated library for all modular components including kids, men, and women’s clothing blocks. - **Compatibility with Old Files:** - Users can still upload files from the old modular library. When an old file is uploaded, a pop-up will inform you that it is from an older library but will still be compatible and load correctly. ### 3. Step-by-Step Instructions #### A. Accessing the Modular Library 1. **Open the Modular Library:** - Navigate to the Modular Library section in your software. 2. **Explore Categories:** - You can find blocks categorized under Kids, Men, and Women. #### B. Importing Old Modular Files 1. **Import the File:** - Drag and drop the file from the old modular library into the new library interface. 2. **Respond to the Pop-Up:** - A pop-up will appear stating that the file is from an older library. Click \"Okay\" to proceed. 3. **Select the Appropriate Category:** - Manually choose the category (e.g., shirts, pants) where you want the imported item to be saved in the new library. #### C. Setting Default Save Location 1. **Access User Settings:** - Go to the settings menu and select \"User Settings.\" 2. **Navigate to Modular Library Settings:** - Find the section labeled \"Other\" and locate the Modular Library option. 3. **Choose Default Folder:** - Click on \"Open\" and select your preferred folder (e.g., Desktop > Testing Modular) where files will be saved by default. #### D. Saving New Designs 1. **Create a New Design:** - After importing or creating a new modular component (e.g., shirt), select \"File\" and then \"Save As.\" 2. **Select Category:** - Choose the category (Men’s, Women’s, Kids) or add your own custom category. 3. **Add Style and Components:** - Specify the style and add any components (e.g., front body, back body, sleeves). 4. **Review and Save:** - Ensure all elements are in place and click \"Save.\" Your design will be stored in the designated folder. ### 4. Tips and Tricks - **Organizing Your Library:** - Regularly categorize and label your modular components to avoid confusion later. - **Using the Default Save Location:** - Setting a default save location is especially beneficial for larger companies or individuals working on multiple projects, ensuring all files are in one place. - **Refer to Tutorials:** - For a deeper understanding, refer to the in-depth modular tutorial available in the library. - **Engage with the Community:** - If you have questions, use the comments section of tutorial videos for assistance. Engaging with others can provide additional insights and tips. ### Conclusion The optimized Modular Library significantly enhances user experience by consolidating resources and maintaining compatibility with existing files. Following the steps outlined in this guide will help you navigate the updates efficiently. For further inquiries, don't hesitate to explore additional resources or engage in community discussions. Enjoy your creative journey with the Modular Library!"

        "Transcript": "hello and welcome to our new skillup workshop for the CL life sync plugin for Unreal Engine 5 in this Workshop you will get a quick introduction of Unreal Engine about its features and functionalities as well as we going to Showcase a workflow for our plin what actually is Andre Lon for everyone who never heard about it anion was developed by epic games in 1998 as a video games Graphics engine later epic games decided to Market their realtime graphic engines so other developers can use it as well in April 2022 the latest version of iral engine 5 was developed with big improvements for 3D visualization this is why the software is now also used in other Industries like the automotive sector virtual production for movie industry product visualization or augmented reality and virtual reality as well as for mobile applications but what's the benefit for the fashion indistry to use this software where conventional render engines require a long time to generate these photo realistic images Andre engion 5 comes to shine with the latest development called Lumen you it's possible to create stunning photo realistic images in uh real time Global elimination raid racing included as you can imagine it will be way faster to create animations of multiple colorways with the same level of detail which you have in Clow on top Android engine can be used to create any kind of environment for your garments epic games has a huge Content Library called quixel bridge where you can find different 3D assets or materials ready to use it also comes with a direct integration for metahuman avatars which looks super realistic and this is the reason why we came up with the Clow life sync plugin for Unreal Engine you can Bridge the project between Clow and Unreal Engine just with a few clicks it's super easy to use and guarantee you that your garments look the exact same it's always subdivided between you can send the garments the Avatar and all kind of Animation without going the manual way from of exporting obj fbx or almic files and readjusting the material Properties or fixing the orientation or scale where can you get it and how do you install it the latest plugin can be found uh on our CL website on connect just go there and download the plug-in and extract the folder the integration on clide is already part of it with close 7.3 there's no further installation needed for Clow once you've downloaded the file you have to extract it I did this already so here I got my extracted folder and you copy the folder inside like here you can see all the content you copy this folder with copy paste inside program files epic games Android engine the latest version it has to be at least 5.3 or newer engine plugins market place and here you can see I've already copied this one inside please do the same another thing is we need the substance plugin as well to make our shaders work properly in this case you have to start the epic games launcher go to Marketplace search for substance here it is substance 3D for Unreal Engine and download and install to your current engine I've already done this so this is why I get this message after this is done you can now start the andreal engine you can see plenty of presets some of them are for video games other ones more for the movie and video industry architecture and automotive and product design so if you want to start from scratch I recommend you to go with the automotive product design and then here's the plank one it has a camera already and some basic light in our case I already have one project file prepared called scaleup which I'm going to open instead for when your project file is opened then you have to do a few changes so first of all at the top right corner you can find the settings if you click on it we want to make sure that the cl Live Sync plugin is properly installed and also activated same goes for the substance plugin so click on settings then plugins search for CL and make sure that you have a check here next to Clow life sync if this is not the case it will always ask you to restart don't do it now because we have a few more changes to do next look for substance substance for u5 already installed and activated this is fine and we can close the window also we need to do a few changes for our actual projects unrelated to the plugin click on settings at the top right corner once again and open the project settings there's plenty of different project settings which you can adjust so this is why we simply look for rhi and here we can see we are currently running with direct X11 by default this should be direct X12 so please make sure to downgrade to direct X11 just to make sure you are not facing any crashes or freezes also look for Trend lency and there should be one checkbox which says enable support for order independent transparency on translucent surfaces you want to make sure that this one is activated as well so you can see any kind of transparency of your Fabrics properly again it says here at the top bottom corner that any changes requires a restart so now it's time to click on restart now and wait for a bit until the project file opens up again now the plugin is ready to use you can find it at window and at the very bottom glow life sync editor it has a 3D viport and two columns on the left and right if you want you can undock this window by click and holding the left Mouse button and dock it next to your map so here I have a environment level and you can always undock it you can also exchange the position so you have it more on the left and here's the map and you can always easily switch through instead of having a second window now it's important that CL is running in the background I do have already a project file open here this futuristic sci-fi outfit which I want to bring into Unreal Engine from pattern tool or simply press contrl h a scroll down in your property editor under miscellaneous and there you can find the mesh type by default this one is set to Triangle but you can convert the polygons into quats as well this will reduce the phase count and vertex count a lot without keeping all the details of your wrinkles and folds now since this is done you can theoretically save this project file and then go back to UNR lenion all you need to do now is Click onto the live sync button here on the top left corner it will give you a warning make sure that the simulation is turned off so please double check if you accidentally simulated make sure that you're in the simulation mode neither in the UV editor mode or in the animation mode and also make sure that you're not accidentally recording some kind of Animation in the background so no misunderstanding animations are perfectly fine to import but don't record any animation meanwhile because otherwise it won't work confirm with okay and press the F key this one will Center it out and zoom in if you now press alt on your keyboard plus the left Mouse button you can rotate around if you press and hold alt plus the right Mouse button you can zoom in and if you press and hold the middle Mouse button including alt you can move up and down so this is basically a very good way to navigate around you can see all the details have been and materials and fabrics have been already loaded I can also see I get some nice transparency there's some kind of mesh fabric I can see what's below and now there's a few steps how we can proceed now there's a few options on how we can further proceed at this step the Fess split between garment and Avatar you always have to choose which one you want to import for garment you can click onto the safe selected objects icon and choose either static mesh if you only want the geometry or geometry cache geometry cache will include the animation as well for Avatar you can also save static mesh and the skeletal mesh which will include the rig so if you have any further animation sequences these ones can be easily applied to your skeletal mesh of your avatar let's proceed with the Garment and choose geometry cache because there's some nice animation also it's preparing the mesh now so instead of exporting an a file waiting until the alambic is exported everything is has will be done in the background give it some time it's quite a long animation once the mesh has been generated a new window will pop up where you can Define uh where you want to save this geometry cache let's choose the my content folder you can click on the triangle to open it up and there's another subfolder called Clow garments below you can give it a different name I'm going to stay with geometry cache and I click on Save now it's actually saving the file e all right it's finished now let's bring this garment into our scene I click at the top tab where it says environment and I'm going to open up the content drawer the content drawer can be found at the bottom left corner you can also press control and the space bar we have to navigate inside the same folder where we saved our geometry cache it was in my content Clow garments and here you go here you can find the geometry cache I'm going to quickly press and hold the right Mouse button to adjust my viewp a bit open up the content drawer again and drag and drop my file in into the scene and that's it exporting the files from CL and importing them in and engine manually would take much more time especially when it comes to adjusting the materials and texture for Andre Engine 5 but by using the plugin you already get everything the textures and rotation and the scale correctly set up every geometry Cache can with material instances if you go inside the geometri cach folder here you can find plenty of material instances each one for each fabric with material instances it's way easier to adjust the material properties like the normal map intensity the color and so on usually this would be a super complex notary which is not very easy if you're new to Android Engine 5 but with material instances it's just a matter of a few clicks so let's take a look I'm going to zoom in by the way you can also navigate by press and holding the right Mouse button and use W S A and D or and Q and E like in a video game and then you can see I'm kind of missing the intensity of my my um leather texture here the normal map intensity this is where I'm going to go to my content drawer open up this leather material here and I'm going to undock it so I can see directly here in 3D scroll down until you see the normal map here you can see it already and look for the normal map intensity it's super low so increase it until it looks more realistic and here we go we have a better normal map I'm going to close this window and I'm going to do the same maybe here for the second met um metallic material I'm going to undock it scroll down and increase here the normal map intensity Maybe to 10 and now I can see the structure showing up properly changing colors is also possible I'm going to open up the material instance for my tarp and dock it look for the base color it's here click inside the color field and then you can easily change the color and give it a different tint so maybe let's make something dark red something like this confirm with okay and we have a new colorway created just like in glow it's possible to set up a studio light system I can see I do have some lights already placed here let a spherical light there's a rectangle light and let me zoom out a bit more there's another rectangle light and a spotlight or you can also make a more natural light like in a natural environment if you want to hide these icons you can press G on your keyboard then the icons will be gone and you can take a look without any graphics it's also possible to create a complete environment with the help of quixel prdge open up your content draw again and click on ADD and say add quixel Bridge quixel content when you open up quixel Bridge the first time you might have to log in with your epic games login credential once again but once you Lo in you can search over 14,000 different assets which are categorized in 3D assets 3D plants surfaces decals and Imperfections so for example if you search for rock you can find a mixture of rock materials and rock 3D objects but if you go to the category surfaces and search for rock again you only get to see the rock materials if you decide to download one of those selected there you can Define the quality click on download and once it's downloaded you can click on ADD and add it to your content drawer I don't have to do this because I already have my content inside my content drawer downloaded and imported whenever you download a new content this Mega scans folder will be created under 3D assets you can find this Forest Rock in my case double click and there you can find all the necessary assets so we have a material instance again the static mesh itself and the textures if you can't see the icons all you need to do is you need to select all five of those and drag and drop by holding the left Mouse click a tiny bit and then you can see the thumbnails properly you want to grab the uh static mesh and drag and drop it into your current scene and here we go we have a rock you can do this multiple times somehow like this or you can also press and hold the ALT key and use the arrow of your Gizmo to create a duplicate if you press space you can easily switch between different types of Gizmo like rotation scale and positioning I'm going to make another duplicate and if you do a right Mouse click onto these 3D static mesh you can also access the transform functionalities in the rightclick menu and for example mirror it on the x-axis maybe something like this maybe a bit more to the front to the bottom somehow like this so This Could Be My Rock environment I do like it and maybe I now want to add a few more things at the top bar you can change from selection mode also to foliage mode with foliage it's super easy to create different kind of trees plants with downloaded assets from your quixel bridge for example I do have in my mega scans folder already a subfolder called 3D plans here we go these static mesh assets will be recognized already as foliage all I need to do is I need to select the ones which I want to play maybe those three you can also Mark them by press and holding shift and do some changes for example you can have a variation in the scale here and then I need to brush them over the surface maybe the scale of your sphere is quite big and looks like this make sure the brush size of your sphere is set to a lower value like one 100 and then you simply brush along the area where you want to place some plants maybe the last one I don't like maybe one more here here we go afterwards I go back from foliage mode into my selection mode that's it the camera animation is now up to you give it a try create something amazing uh there's quite a few tutorials out there where you can learn everything about camera animation and its properties and also about the sequencer which you need to create a camera animation at the top bar you can also find the play button if you click this button you're actually running your level now and you can also see your garment in motion isn't this amazing let's talk about metum met human is epic games new Avatar Creator simply go to meta human. unrealengine.com and choose your Unreal Engine version so 5.3 it's completely browser based and easy to use you can work with pre-made metahuman avatars and customize them so I'm going to click on start meter human Creator and and once everything is loaded I'm ready to create my own unique meta human Avatar click on Create and choose one of the presets which you want to start with and at the bottom you can create the character you can change anything regarding the facial look you can choose between um 18 different body shapes from small average and Tall the important thing is that you don't apply any clothing because you want to later apply the Garment in Clow once you're happy all the changes will be automatically saved and linked to your quixel Bridge it can be downloaded the same way as we just did for the 3D assets at the quixel bridge the rocks for example going back to Unreal Engine I have another map another level prepared I open my content draw go to maps and open up the studio it will ask me if I want to save the current changes in this level including this um garment I say save selected and then the studio level will be loaded just for you as a repetition so if you want to add this meta human I have my meta human already here imported but you might need to do it on your own click on ADD open the quixel content the quixel bridge again and here you can find the metahumans under my metahumans this is where you should see your current newly created metahumans I'm going back to my studio I closed the bridge and you can Dr and drop the meter human into your scene file make sure that the location of the meter human is set to 0 0 so you select it and null it out and then create a new level sequence there's multiple ways how to import the meter human now into Clow the easiest I'm going to show you here we can see this icon you can create a new level sequence I have a subfolder already created I recommend you to keep your folder structure nice and tidy and I call this one meter human level sequence and I click on Save I select the Met human it will be also automatic selected in my outliner and I drag and drop it from the outliner into my sequencer here you can see the full Ricks and handle there's the body below and here's the control rig you can set a key frame at zero move forward maybe 30 frames as a transition and then animate the a pose into a more relaxed pose so for example I'm going to zoom in I click on this handle and I'm going to rotate this arm and that arm down by 20 de this one as well by 10 and maybe a few degrees back 20 degrees to the back something like this you can do the same for the feed as well but I think this one looks quite good and then you have to scroll to the top again to see the control rig and create once again next to the control rig another key frame at frame 30 if you scrub back and forth you can see you now have a key frame animation going from the a pose into the relaxed pose so it's up to you which pose you're going to create afterwards right click onto the body and say create linked animation sequence we always do need an animation sequence in order to export the uh metahuman Avatar Into CL you can leave the folder path where it is confirm with okay you can leave the settings to its default and you say export to animation sequence after this is done at the bottom right corner you can see the animation quence has been created click on open and then you have the animation and a new window and also you notice we have the live sync button once again before we're going to export this one I'm quickly going to create a new project so I'm click on file new project I want something empty now then I go back to Unreal click onto the live sync button say skeletal mesh leave the settings as they are and then select export you can see our Avatar has been properly imported into glow it doesn't come with any textures it's completely white because we only need it for the traping purpose we later going want to render it again in unreal let's quickly apply some garment I simply going to choose this basic female t-shirt adjust its position simulate change the mesh uh mesh type to quats maybe reduce the particle distance and apply a new fabric to this one let's go with cotton canvas and maybe change the color to something more interesting like green and simulate if you go to the the animation modee you can see the animation is also included to your avatar so if you want you can record the animation now so it comes with the animation in our case we already have done a geometry cache like we already imported animation let's go for a static mesh this time so go back into the simulation mode make sure the SIM simulation is turned off back to Unreal go to the life sync editor I have this TP already open if it's closed then simply go to your level here that's the Live Sync editor and click on update that's it the Garment and the avatar has been loaded I'm going to click onto the Garment save it as a static mesh choose my content CL gments the name static mesh is fine and confirm with okay afterwards I'm going to leave the sequencer you can close it here open the content drawer go to my content clog garment static mesh it's actually here under glow garments there's the static mesh drag and drop it into your scene to match the position you simply have to apply the same location coordinates which were 0 0 0 and now she's wearing the Garment since we still have some time let's do something more complicated and apply an idle animation onto our metahuman open the content drawer and go to your meter humans folder inside there I can find my current meta human I do a rightmost click inside the content draer under animation I go to the bottom where it says retargeting and I create a ik retargeter I can call it I retargeter MH don't use any space and open this one at the right side this is where the interesting thing is happening you always need a source for an animation so the source for animation could be any kind of other animated avatar from Unreal Engine by default Unreal Engine comes with these mannequin avatars if you don't have those avatars inside your content drawer yet you can simply open the content drawer say add and then add feature and content pack and use the third person content pack then you get this Avatar including its animation imported so you can also use meter human to run around like this this one is already done so I can click here use the ik mannequin oops it's quite big that's the male one so maybe I can search for Quinn Quinn is the female one so this is my source Rick and the source Smash and then I want to apply it to my meter human so I choose the meter human ik meter human and here we go this is what I want I can offset it not on the top maybe here to the side so I can see them next to each other and then I can choose between all these different animations in my asset browser which are already applied to this Quinn character so we have this idle animation here quite in the center double click and now you can see our met human is doing the exact same once this one is selected with a double click you can click on export selected animation to animation sequence so let's choose our meta human folder I have an animation folder here created and I say export here we go you can go back to your level the studio level select your meter human down here where it says body inside the detail you can change the animation mode from Custom to animation asset and then apply a different animation maybe the idle animation which we've just created here we go now our metahuman is idling but my t-shirt of course doesn't fit anymore so I need to delete this one so maybe I need to create a new one um double click onto the is animation which just has been saved since this is the um animation sequence window I can now once again click onto the live sync button save a skeletal mesh and click on export then I go back to Glow you can see the animation has been loaded I only need to quickly adjust my drape so something like this I will do the Now quickly looks good so far then I go to my animation window simulate my animation okay I think that's enough go back to unreal the Liv sync editor tab click on update oh this one won't work good that I have this warning on because I have to leave the animation sequence I have to go back to simulation and then I can confirm with okay so you can see it's quite easy it's always the same process and super intuitive so thank you for joining um I hope this session gave you an idea of the power of unre engion 5 in combination with cl life sync plugin please take a closer look at what you can do with meuman and its official edit official website for the next 5 to 10 minutes we will try to answer any question questions you have regarding UNR lenion or CL also please let us know in the chat or through the survey which other topics you are interested in for our next skillup Workshop ",

        "Transcript": "hey all you clovers my name is Phoebe and I'm going to show you this really great feature it's Trace as internal shapes for graphics it's really fun and great and we can go through it it's going to be really eye openening so let's Jump On In have some fun while we learn okay let's talk about the edit graphic tool tracing so I'm going to go to my edit Gra graic tool over here see so cute and here I'm going to select this graphic CL you know in case you guys forget which software we're using CL and then what I can do is rightclick once I've right clicked I'm going to have this option right Trace as internal shape this is where the magic happens I can then select trace's internal shape look at over here in the 3D window how like it's outlined around because that's the internal shape that's just been created I can then select my graphic move this away if I want and it's a little bit hard to see but it's right here my internal shape if I go to my edit pattern tool I can then see it a little bit better in red I'll also show it over here in my 3D window the red internal shape so pretty cool right you're probably like oh oh my gosh that is really cool like but what can I do with it what can't you do with it there's so many things you can do with this now you can use this for like creating OST or like re or like patch Graphics or anything like that so it's really cool because I can then just select these internal lines right right click clone as pattern with sewing it's cloned what you might have also noticed is is this so what I'm also going to do here is I'm going to select this right click copy then paste right into here and then I can rightclick and convert to Ho you might be like phoe that didn't do anything it did I just have a shape inside look at that then I'm just going to quickly sell this great and to save my computer a little bit I'm just going to right click and superimpose over and I've created a really cool and easy patch I can also then of course because now they're pattern pieces lower this down to like a five particle distance and simulate and what's really cool is let me just delete this graphic is now since all of this is a pattern just add this I can now like change out this fabric I can make it any color I want um I can also like do any type so I could say like this is shiny um I could make it a velvet you know you can really do a lot of things now to this also if you wanted to you could then decide to like right click and cut right and then you could cut literally this all out and delete these and then it could be but just make sure you cut and sew this to this and delete these so that then they like it acts as it it's like truly a part of the it's not sitting on top it could be like sitting below or like a little bit indented in more so if I do that I can then simulate and you see how that's like inside I forgot to S the oh oh no I forgot to sew the Oh okay that's all the jokes for today I promise I can also now see why this is so weird all right nice sometimes you just need to do the extra mile I could then like okay look at this I could then select this stuff and I could make this like a thicker rendering make this a bit thicker and then it would make it look like this is indented in like that's kind of cool so you like can really do a lot of different things it's really up to you like I can make this plastic right I could like add pressure to this you might be like why would you do that but you could add pressure so that it pushes in slightly right so that it like goes in and then you have like another extra like you know the extra o you could then add like top stitching right there's so many things you can do to this like make your graphics look more realistic and cooler and all of that it's like out there here is something you might not be like oh I can do that and that is you could also use this when it comes to production as well so if I go into let me just open up my other file right before we go into other techniques in which you can use this I just want to also show you what will happen if you had a graphic with a white background or other backgrounds and how that will work so let me bring in some graphics so here if I bring in this graphic which has a PNG background everything's groovy I can rightclick say traces internal shape and it'll all work great as we all know right now if I bring in a patch that has a white background I can again right click Trace as internal shape and CH will know that with the white background that probably means it's not supposed to be there and it will just trace the shapes that aren't white now if it was a different color background like pink or purple or like I don't know something else K would not recognize that and it will Trace that color so it is only for white backgrounds that CL acknowledges like oh this is probably like a background it's probably not meant and it won't trace it but if it isn't white it will not do that so white it will not white it won't let's jump into how you can use this kind of technique with things outside of just your regular graphic creation way so here I have my other file and what I did is there was an all over print right of this anchor and then I created a separate like single graphic for that what you can then do is Select that let me just so now I'm going to put place this on my shirt actually plac it pretty damn close and then I can rightclick and say like okay this is like how I always want my Graphics to line up like I always want the anchor to be centered just like this every time so then I can right click traces internal shape cool and then I can do the same for this right click Trace as internal shape then I can just go through delete all these graphics and when I go into print layout you'll see that then I can use the this internal shape now to help align my patterns to my print layout so that it always lines up where I want it to be which is really cool right like that's like really really helpful makes it so life can work a lot faster and it you can always be like aligned aligned aligned aligned aligned but yeah so there's a lot of different ways to use this tool which is really really fun but the concept's always the same right so it's always going to be edit graphic tool select your graphic let me bring it in select the graphic right click Trace those internal shape hey everyone thank you so much for watching the video I hope you enjoyed it and I hope that you can't wait to add in graphics as in a cool new way and all of that we really hope that you enjoyed this feature as much as we did making it for you all and if you have any questions use the comment section below there's always a 3D designer there to help you all and if you want to learn more and if you want to keep learning about CL and everything check out this channel the CL YouTube channel there's so many great videos to learn and to watch about thanks again ",
        "Summary": "# Comprehensive Guide to the \"Trace as Internal Shape\" Feature in CL Software ## Introduction This guide will provide step-by-step instructions, definitions, and tips for using the \"Trace as Internal Shape\" feature in the CL software, as demonstrated by Phoebe. This feature allows users to create internal shapes based on graphics, which can enhance the design process and provide creative options for garment design. ## What is \"Trace as Internal Shape\"? \"Trace as Internal Shape\" is a feature that allows users to convert graphics into internal shapes within the CL software. This can be useful for creating patterns, patches, and for aligning graphics on garments accurately. ## Step-by-Step Instructions ### Step 1: Access the Edit Graphic Tool 1. **Open CL Software**: Launch the CL software on your computer. 2. **Select the Edit Graphic Tool**: Locate and click on the \"Edit Graphic\" tool icon (referred to as \"gra graic tool\" in the transcript). ### Step 2: Choose Your Graphic 1. **Select a Graphic**: Click on the graphic you wish to trace. Ensure that you are working with a suitable graphic (preferably with a white background for optimal results). ### Step 3: Right-Click to Trace 1. **Right-Click on the Selected Graphic**: This will open a context menu. 2. **Select \"Trace as Internal Shape\"**: Click on this option. You will see an outline in the 3D window indicating the internal shape created. ### Step 4: Viewing the Internal Shape 1. **Move the Original Graphic**: If needed, you can move the original graphic to see the newly created internal shape more clearly. 2. **Switch to Edit Pattern Tool**: Select the \"Edit Pattern\" tool. The internal shape will appear in red, making it easier to visualize. ### Step 5: Utilizing the Internal Shape 1. **Clone Internal Shape**: Right-click on the internal shape and select \"Clone as Pattern with Sewing\" to create a new pattern piece. 2. **Copy and Paste**: You can also copy the internal shape and paste it into a new area within the design. ### Step 6: Converting to Ho (Hollow) 1. **Right-Click and Select \"Convert to Ho\"**: This converts the internal shape into a hollow shape, allowing you to create unique design elements. ### Step 7: Adjusting and Saving 1. **Superimpose the Shape**: Right-click and choose \"Superimpose Over\" to effectively save your design. 2. **Adjust Particle Distance**: Lower the particle distance for finer detail in your design. 3. **Simulate**: Use the simulation feature to visualize how the design appears in 3D. ### Step 8: Changing Fabrics and Colors 1. **Change Fabric Properties**: Select the internal shape and change its fabric type, color, or texture (e.g., shiny, velvet). 2. **Add Pressure**: Apply pressure to create effects such as indentations in the fabric. ### Step 9: Final Touches 1. **Add Top Stitching**: Enhance your design by adding features like top stitching to make it look more realistic. 2. **Align Graphics for Production**: Use the internal shape to help align your patterns accurately in print layout. ## Tips and Tricks - **Use Graphics with White Backgrounds**: This feature works best with graphics that have white backgrounds, as the software identifies non-white areas as part of the graphic. - **Experiment with Different Designs**: Don’t hesitate to experiment with various graphics to see what designs you can create. - **Utilize Multiple Patterns**: You can create multiple internal shapes from different graphics and combine them for complex designs. - **Regularly Save Your Work**: To avoid losing any progress, ensure you save your work frequently. ## Conclusion The \"Trace as Internal Shape\" feature in CL software is a powerful tool for designers looking to enhance their graphics and streamline their design processes. By following this guide, you can effectively utilize this feature to create unique and professional designs.

Ensure you do not select the tape or teeth, as this will not activate the two-way zipper options. ### Step 2: Access the Property Editor 1. **Open Property Editor**: Look for the property editor panel on your screen, usually located on the side or bottom. 2. **Find the Type Option**: Within the property editor, locate the 'Type' option. ### Step 3: Change to Two-Way Zipper 1. **Choose Two-Way**: Click on the dropdown menu next to 'Type' and select 'Two-Way'. 2. **Select Configuration**: You will see options for zipper configurations: - **Bottom to Bottom**: Both sliders will be at the bottom end of the zipper. - **Head to Head**: Both sliders will be at the top end, ideal for bags. ### Step 4: Customize Your Zipper 1. **Edit Sliders**: You can individually edit each slider, changing their styles or colors as needed. 2. **Adjust Gauge**: If necessary, adjust the gauge (the size of the zipper) to fit your design. 3. **Simulate Functionality**: Test the functionality of your zipper by attempting to unzip it within the software. ### Step 5: Test Zipper Functionality 1. **Unzip**: Click and drag the puller to unzip the zipper. You should be able to open the zipper from either end. 2. **Visualize Contents**: Imagine or visualize what could be stored inside (keys, wallet, etc.) and ensure your design allows for easy access. ### Step 6: Revert to One-Way Zipper (if needed) 1. **Select the Zipper**: Click on the zipper slider again to access the property editor. 2. **Change Back to One-Way**: In the 'Type' dropdown, select 'One Way' to revert the zipper back to a traditional single-direction zipper. ## Tips and Tricks - **Experiment with Styles**: Try different slider and puller styles to see what works best for your design. - **Use Realistic Testing**: If your software allows it, simulate zipping and unzipping to ensure the design works as intended. - **Stay Organized**: Keep your layers organized in the design software for easier adjustments and edits later. - **Seek Feedback**: If you're unsure about your design, ask for feedback from others to find areas for improvement. - **Watch Tutorials**: For more complex designs, consider watching additional tutorials on the platform for more in-depth guidance. ## Conclusion With this guide, you should be able to confidently use the two-way zipper feature in your design software. This functionality can enhance your bag and garment designs, providing added utility and style.

        "Transcript": "hi everyone my name is Mariam and today I'm going to show you some tricks on how to make a lettuce effect in clo through   D I have a jersey dress and I want to add a lettuce effect on the necklines and hem then I want to imitate seam allowances that are turned to the outside also with a lettuce effect there are three ways to achieve this first method is to use the elastic tool with the edit pattern tool shortcut Z you can select the edge where you want to apply the effect and then go to the property editor on the right under selected line you can check the elastic box the ratio of the elastic is by default set to 80 so the line would be shortened by 20% instead of 80 I will set the ratio 2 to 100 I would leave the strength at 10 and now when I simulate you will see how the neckline gets those waves I'm activating the mesh view so I can show you another great tool that you can use here even though the part iCal distance of this pattern piece is set to six my neckline isn't smooth enough yet to make it smoother and more curly I have now the option of adding sharing by checking the sharing box right below elastic now you can see that this two made the particles surrounding this line smaller and when I simulate you can see that it looks much better now to finish up I'm going to add a four needle overlock Stitch that I got from the CL Library make sure the top Stitch is added on both back and front so it looks realistic for this you select the top Stitch and scroll way down in the property editor under configuration face you can find the settings for this I'm hiding the Avatar so you can see the back side the second way to make a letters effect is to use the spiral tool first I use the edit pattern tool to select the line and see its length in the property editor then I go to my 2D2 bar and select the spiral tool by clicking the left Mouse button a window pops up and I can type in my desired measurements depending on the length of your line you might need to try out a few different numbers before you get it right but thanks to the preview we can see the end result already the numbers will change slightly after you enter them as the spiral is built proportionally now I have my spiral and I can add it to my hemline as an additional seam allowance I use the free sewing tool to sew the patterns together and superimpose Sid so the pattern p piece goes directly where it belongs sometimes you have to superimpose side two times to get the direction right additionally I can change the particle distance of the Spiral petum piece to three and we see it's a nice lettuce hem with larger waves now again adding the overlock stitch for a more realistic look for imitating the seam allowances that are turned to the outside I have already added internal lines to my patterns that I can use to sew the seam allowances on I'm checking the length of the line then I'm making a spiral pattern and use the freewing tool to attach the spiral to the front lastly I add the top Stitch and simulate again the last method is a combination of the first two and it's my preferred one for what I want to achieve for this dress after making a spiral and adding it to the ham and internal lines I am selecting the outer edge of the Spiral and adding negative elastic to it here you can see how the different methods look like and depending on what you need you can adjust them or or combine them I hope this tutorial was helpful and you learn something new today if you have any questions leave a comment below and subscribe to our Channel as we have many new tutorials coming up soon   ",
        "Summary": "Sure! Below is a comprehensive guide based on the provided transcript, including step-by-step instructions, definitions, and useful tips and tricks for creating a lettuce effect in Clo3D. --- # Comprehensive Guide to Creating Lettuce Effects in Clo3D ## Introduction In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a lettuce effect on necklines and hems using Clo3D (a 3D garment visualization tool). There are three main methods to achieve this effect: using the elastic tool, the spiral tool, and a combination of both. --- ## Definitions - **Lettuce Effect**: A wavy, ruffled edge often seen in knit fabrics, resembling the edges of lettuce leaves. - **Elastic Tool**: A feature in Clo3D that allows you to apply elastic properties to pattern edges, causing them to contract. - **Spiral Tool**: A tool that generates spiral patterns, which can simulate wavy edges. - **Sewing Tool**: A tool that allows you to sew pattern pieces together. - **Particle Distance**: Refers to the density of mesh particles in Clo3D; smaller values yield finer details. --- ## Step-by-Step Instructions ### Method 1: Using the Elastic Tool 1. **Select the Edge**: - Use the Edit Pattern Tool (shortcut: Z) to select the edge of the neckline or hem where you want to apply the lettuce effect. 2. **Open Property Editor**: - Navigate to the Property Editor on the right side of the screen. 3. **Apply Elastic**: - Under the \"Selected Line\" section, check the \"Elastic\" box. - Set the Elastic Ratio to 100% (this means the line will not be shortened). - Leave the Strength at 10. 4. **Simulate**: - Click the simulate button to observe how the neckline develops waves. 5. **Smoothing the Effect**: - Activate Mesh View to get a better visual. - Check the \"Shearing\" box (below the Elastic option) to make particle sizes smaller for a smoother, curlier effect. - Simulate again to see the improved look. 6. **Add Overlock Stitch**: - Go to the CL Library and select a four-needle overlock stitch. - Ensure the top stitch is added to both the back and front for realism. --- ### Method 2: Using the Spiral Tool 1. **Select the Edge**: - Again, use the Edit Pattern Tool to select the line of your hem. 2. **Access the Spiral Tool**: - In the 2D toolbar, select the Spiral Tool by clicking the left mouse button. - A window will pop up; enter your desired measurements. 3. **Adjust Spiral Settings**: - Experiment with different measurements as needed; the preview will help you visualize changes. - Once satisfied, you'll have a spiral pattern. 4. **Sew the Spiral**: - Use the Free Sewing Tool to sew the spiral pattern to the hemline, ensuring it aligns correctly. You may need to superimpose it twice. 5. **Adjust Particle Distance**: - Set the Particle Distance of the spiral pattern piece to 3 for larger waves. - Simulate to observe the lettuce hem effect. 6. **Add Overlock Stitch**: - Just like in Method 1, add the overlock stitch for a realistic finish. --- ### Method 3: Combination of Both 1. **Create a Spiral**: - Follow the steps from Method 2 to create and sew the spiral pattern to the hem and internal lines. 2. **Apply Negative Elastic**: - Select the outer edge of the spiral. - In the Property Editor, apply a negative elastic setting to this edge. 3. **Simulate**: - Simulate the garment to see how the combined effects create a desirable lettuce finish. 4. **Final Adjustments**: - Review all settings and make any necessary adjustments to achieve your desired look. --- ## Tips and Tricks - **Experiment**: Don’t hesitate to try different ratios and particle distances to see how they affect the final look. - **Use Mesh View**: Activating Mesh View can help you get a clearer picture of how the fabric behaves. - **Layering Effects**: Combining methods often yields the best results, allowing for more customization. - **Realism**: Adding stitches like the overlock stitch can greatly enhance the realism of your garment. --- ## Conclusion This guide provides a detailed overview of creating a lettuce effect in Clo3D, which will enhance the visual appeal of your designs. If you have any questions or would like to see more tutorials, please leave comments or subscribe to the channel for future updates! Happy designing! --- Feel free to customize the guide further based on your specific needs!"

        "Transcript": "hi everyone my name is Phoebe and today I'm going to walk you through our knitwear feature so we're really excited about this feature it's going to get you more visual knitting than ever before it's going to look so much more realistic it's going to be really great so let's dive on in and learn all on how we can edit the knitting create the knitting and all of that so let's have some fun while we learn all right knitwear are we ready so I don't know if you all know but we've added this like knitwear feature to CL that's really really cool let's first start by like showing you all of the stitches we have as presets and like how you can use them and do all of that so here we have kind of a little bit of a layout and what we're going to do is we're going to add stitches to each one so the first one here is our garter so so I'm going to select my fabric here as you see and if I go to my property editor I can then go to type right down here below and I'm going to select knitwear right the knitwear is really really important so I'm going to select knitwear you'll see that garter is the first option here and what I'm going to do is zoom in and here here is my garter Stitch nice right so I have some options once I have my gter Stitch and I can edit it around but let's just first see all of the stitches so this is my garter next we have stock net so again I'm going to go to type knitwear and then under stitching I'm going to switch to stock net nice next we have reverse stock net again select fabric knitwear under type and then stitching reverse stock nut so it's this simple to switch around to different like stitches and everything it's all within the Stitch it's this drop down and then you can switch between these different Stitch presets that we have for you right now you're only only able to use these presets we are working on getting you more and also seeing how we can make it so that you can even create your own presets and all of that it is all in the work so don't you worry okay so now I have all these stitches here what I'm going to do is simulate now here's something you should know when you simulate right so I'm going to simulate not much is going to really change that's because the fabric property is still the same all that's being changed right now is the visual so I can select all of these here and I can change it to a like a knit property right so I can change it to like cut and so rib here and then simulate and then it will start to change but changing to this visual will not actually change the Fabric's properties it all visual so what do I mean by that you might ask well great question let's look at the garer and St stock net side by side right now these two both of these Fabrics are using this new visual technique which actually changes your mesh let's just change garter back to fabric map and again I can simulate it's going to stay exactly the same the visual that's being changed is the mesh itself so if I actually let me turn off simulation if I go here and I show mesh you see already that this mesh is very different right from this you can't even really even see this mesh that's because this mesh is completely shaped in a different way than what our normal meshes are it's actually like 3D and dimensional and really tight and all of that so the mesh is actually completely shaped differently here that's why if you change the fabric properties that will then change the draping but the visual aspect of this is changing quite a bit not the physical just know this FYI now I know what some of you might ask you might ask okay but like then if I select my patterns does me changing out the particle distance change it like it did in the old way cuz when you would select this if I then selected this and changed my partical distance and hit simulate like it would change does it do the same thing yeah this will still change right because this is not the knit but it will not actually the particle distance for this stuff will not actually change that much because it's already a completely different mesh and it's already a smaller particle distance and all of that that's why it's so important if you are going to do a lot of editing quickly to hide the show knitwear option so you want to actually hide the knitwear so once you do that then all your mesh will go back to that flat mesh once you hit show knitware it will then go back to the three-dimensional mesh that's actually really really hard to see because it's so tiny and everything that is just some background and mesh when we get to the Garment we'll uh look at it even more but here now I have all my stitches all laid out and everything what can I do with these well you can do quite a bit first off so happy you asked thank you um so what can you do with these stitches well you can do a lot there's all of these options down below after you go to stitching there's gauge ply amount yarn thickness generating seams and then seam length seam curvature for the generating seams the ply normal map ply colors and then also you could add in a texture if you wanted and you could change add in like an overall color you can adjust your roughness all of that so quite a bit to adjust Even in our first round for the knitwear let's talk about what each section means right so Gage for anyone of you who's not like a Knitter or like I don't know who doesn't own a knitting machine or or like doesn't like knit at home by hand whatever the gauge is more like s's PR meaning it's really important for machines and all of that a lot of the time you you don't really do a lot with Gauge when you're doing like hand hand knitting like you do know right like because you have to know the needle and like how many stitches do make up your inch but um there are like set gauges on knitting machines and I know most of you already know this and you're like yeah Phoebe we know you don't need to teach me about knitting but let me just teach you about glow so we have this gauge option the lower your gauge the less stitches you'll have per inch making it so like you could create really open knits kind of like this right now let's go to the stock if you have a higher gauge that means you have a lot more stitches per inch which means you're going to create really really tight stitches especially if you have a a thicker yarn so this gauge has a lot to do with yarn thickness too so if you want to like make it really nice and match it up well always make sure if you're going to change your gauge to also change your yarn thickness so the higher I go up with this gauge right the lower I should go down with my yarn thickness so I can go down to like 75 and that will make it look nice I could go down to 0.5 too that will make it look really nice and all of that and I can keep highering this up and all of that and I could then do 0.25 right the same can be said when I want to go big with this garter Stitch here so if I want to have go like really low in my gauge I could also go really high with my thickness so I could say two right that's like a nice thickness I could go up even higher say like four and then I've got like this really chunky knit almost we could do with like blankets or like pillows I don't know like the fun chunky knitting that you sometimes do so you can really play around with the yarn thickness and the gauge but play around with them together because when you pair them together then you're going to get better results and everything but also you've seen like sometimes it's really fun and we can do this with the for stock netting here like it's also nice when you do a really low gauge and you can sometimes just like see through it and everything or if you like want more like open kind of like almost a lace laish look like a very open kind of knit look that you might go for so it's really nice the gauge and seam length now underneath gauge we have this thing called PL ply them out ply them out now okay again I know a lot of you already know this you're like FEI I don't need a lesson in knitting but some of you might okay so let's just do it real quick ply amount ply amount is kind of like think of ends the amount of ends you have in one in one yarn so as we all know or some of us know or now all of us will know most Yarns have like multiple Yarns within it because you're twisting it because that makes the yarn even stronger so what we're saying here is how many pies are in that yarn so most Yarns have at least two the really really chunky Yarns might not or if you're like knitting from roving then yeah you just have one ply but and that's like a whole another thing but for apply amounts you we now have one all the way to six I'm going to say four right now because that's a little bit more standard but the ply amounts mean how many times it's going to be wrapped around if I zoom in really tight here you can kind of start to see like these Grays that like are twisting around that are really nice so that's like how many PR if I change this out a bit to one you see like there's less of that versus the four when there's more and all of that so what do you pair the ply amount with well what's really nice is you can you can actually pair this with your colors which is really cool so let's say for seed actually I only have like one and then I change my color to I don't know let's say this then it's going to be completely uniformed all one color easy right cuz that's just my one F now let's go to moss moss let's say there's three right also GNA my   gug there let's say there's three now what I can do is go to my colors so now I have more of like a multiple colored all these different colored Plies and everything that like more kind of I'm this is giving me a Halloween five I don't know why but it is we could also do like let's say four and you want more wait so with three let's go to rip one by one and let's say we have the four you could also do something that has like more subtle right so you could apply and then apply my a little bit more subtle changes you can even go back here and go back to this one um this one right and then this gives like nice depth and range but not too different so there's a lot of ways in which you can play around with this ply to make it kind of look like how you want what's also really nice is we can go to the rib 2 by two is you can do all of these changes so I can say like I want to tighter gauge 75 um four here so let's go to Blue so I have all of this here now and what I can also do is I can go and play around with my roughness so I can adjust this a bit and this will also adjust with the light so if I want it I can turn this off so if I want this to be a little bit rougher less um reflection coming in I can adjust that I can also create more um reflection intensity or lower that right and I can play around my roughness to see like how shiny I want it right like this is very shiny because the roughness is low or I can increase it to make it a little bit matter and like rougher which is also really nice you also have the option of here with this uh rib 4x4 is you can also BR like just do one color completely over so if you didn't want to go through like oh like let me do pies you can just have one like and then that also can give you a nice like effect another thing you can do though is you could bring in a texture if you wanted to so here I can open up and and so you can also add in like textures and then it can also be seen in your print in your like knit which is also really cool so like you can start to add like if you wanted kind of like a knitted print you could do that too and you can also see how then that's like part of the knit as well which is really really nice so those are some like textural and like image and color and sizing and yarn and all of that kind of changes we also have this option for generating seams so I left this one for last because this one's a little bit hard to wrap your head around so you can have this on or off off it like Cuts all the edges clean as if you're doing a cut and sew so that's PR nice because if you're doing like a cut and sew then yeah you should have the edges clean off and then you can just like sew it together and the Hem should be like behind and inside the Garment however if you're doing something more of like a fully fashioned then maybe you want to check generate seams right here on and that will then extend these out and allow you to play around like that so if I rotate here to the side you can see this a little bit better so so right now I have generate seams on I have a pretty high curvature and a low seam length what happens is if I lower this curvature then that means like this curve goes straighter it's easier to just show you so I'm going to lower this and you see how now the curve starts to get straighter and straighter less curved back see I can also then lengthen these right so that it goes longer but the big change is always the curvature so the lower the curvature goes like the more it's going to go out but also then that makes it so that the length could get higher because the curvature is going out more if you lowered down the length back to like zero though it won't matter what your curvature is because you don't have any length in your um scene so if you go all the way down with your curvature it goes really far out like this so this is like if you really don't want any curve or anything that's a zero one and that's very extreme but then you can have your line length really really low if you wanted if you were like oh let's just do one this shouldn't really have any right so if it shouldn't have any curve then there you go but most of the time I think you would want to have a lot of a curve because most of the time it's getting tucked in or it's getting curved behind so for this one let's just go through with everything that we've learned right so with these two let's go through everything that we've learned so here like a for this one one final thing so you've probably all been noticing that there's this like ply normal map just so you all see what it looks like it looks like basically a ball of yarn this is how it's getting that like wrapping around look almost to it it's not adding any Dimension no Dimension is being added because the mesh is now three-dimensional yeah and there you have it a bunch of knit options that are all really really cool and that you can play around with so let's quickly jump actually to a garment and play around with it so okay so here I've got a project file and I've got this cute little shirt here and what I'm going to do is add in some of these stitches that we have just gone over so now I have a garment that uses all of these different types of knits applied really quickly and easily because you can of course save these and also if you're playing around with the different types so here if I went back to Silk satin and then I went back to knit it would save that stuff out which is all really really nice and I can also show you a little bit again if I go to the mesh you're start to see a little bit better on her just what I'm talking about so you can kind of see how this mesh is in the shape of a knit so it's very very different from these meshes right because this mesh is in the shape of a knit so that's why it's a very very different which is why it's really really important to hide knitwear if you're trying to work really fast or if you're trying to do a lot of colorways it's just going to make your life so much easier than if you have show it wear on the whole time and then you're trying to edit so like please remember to use the like hide show knitwear when you're about to edit things or adjust things or anything like that so here are some of great render examples of using the knitwear tool thank you all so much for watching I hope you enjoyed everything and that you're excited to start knitting if you have any questions use the comment section below if you want to learn more check out our YouTube channel there's so many great videos to learn from and so many things to learn about within our CL software and close set all in our YouTube channel and thanks so much for watching I hope you enjoyed ",
        "Summary": "# Comprehensive Guide to the Knitwear Feature in CL Software ## Introduction Welcome to the comprehensive guide on the new knitwear feature in CL software. This feature enhances the visual realism of knitting designs, allowing users to create and edit knitting patterns with ease. In this guide, we'll cover all aspects of the knitwear feature, including step-by-step instructions, definitions, tips, and tricks. ## Overview of Knitwear Feature The knitwear feature in CL allows you to visualize knitting styles such as garter, stockinette, and reverse stockinette. It provides a more realistic representation of knitting patterns and the ability to manipulate various elements of the knit design, such as stitches, yarn thickness, and texture. ## Step-by-Step Instructions ### 1. Accessing the Knitwear Feature - Open your CL software and load your project. - Select the fabric you want to edit. ### 2. Selecting Stitches - Go to the **Property Editor** panel. - Under the **Type** section, select **Knitwear**. - From the **Stitching** dropdown, choose from the available stitch presets: - **Garter** - **Stockinette** - **Reverse Stockinette** ### 3. Editing Stitches - After selecting a stitch, zoom in to view the details. - You can simulate the changes by clicking on the **Simulate** button. Note that the visual changes are purely aesthetic and do not affect the fabric properties. ### 4. Understanding Fabric Properties - Changing the fabric type will alter the draping and physical properties. To see these changes: - Toggle between showing and hiding knitwear (use the **Show Knitwear** option). - When hidden, the mesh will appear flat; when shown, it will display the three-dimensional knit structure. ### 5. Adjusting Gauge and Yarn Thickness - **Gauge**: Represents the number of stitches per inch. - Lower gauge = open knits (fewer stitches) - Higher gauge = tight knits (more stitches) - **Yarn Thickness**: Adjust the thickness according to the gauge for the best results. - For lower gauge, increase yarn thickness. - For higher gauge, decrease yarn thickness. ### 6. Adjusting Other Knitwear Properties - **Ply Amount**: Refers to the number of strands twisted together in the yarn. - Range: 1 to 6 (e.g., 1 for single-ply, 4 for standard). - **Roughness**: Controls the texture's appearance. - Lower roughness = shinier finish. - Higher roughness = matte finish. ### 7. Generating Seams - Toggle the **Generate Seams** option. - With seams generated, you can adjust seam length and curvature. - **Curvature**: Lower values create straighter seams; higher values create more pronounced curves. - **Length**: Adjust to determine how long the seam extends. ### 8. Adding Textures and Colors - You can add textures to your knit: - Import a texture file to apply it within your knit. - Change the overall color by selecting a color from the color picker. ### 9. Finalizing Your Design - Once your design is complete, ensure to simulate again to check the final look. - Save your project to keep the changes. ## Definitions - **Garter Stitch**: A type of knitting where every row is knitted, creating a textured fabric. - **Stockinette Stitch**: Alternates between knit and purl rows, resulting in a smooth side and a bumpy side. - **Reverse Stockinette**: Similar to stockinette but with the purl side facing out. - **Gauge**: The number of stitches per inch in knitting. - **Ply**: The number of individual strands twisted together to form a yarn. ## Tips and Tricks - **Hide Knitwear**: Use the hide option to work more efficiently when making adjustments to your design. - **Experiment with Combinations**: Play with different combinations of gauge, yarn thickness, and ply to find unique textures and styles. - **Utilize the Community**: Engage with online communities or forums to share your designs and gain insights from other users. ## Conclusion The new knitwear feature in CL software opens up a world of possibilities for designing knit garments with a high level of detail and realism. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can effectively utilize this feature to enhance your creative projects. For further learning, check out tutorials and additional resources available on the CL YouTube channel. Happy knitting!"
