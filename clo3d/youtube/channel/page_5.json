        "Transcript": "Introduction and Purpose Hello, everyone! Do you want to play in VRChat wearing \ngarments you've personally designed? Create unique avatars with \nyour own special designs! It's easy with EveryWear. In this video, we'll learn how to convert garments from CLO or Marvelous designer into \nVRChat garments using EveryWear. VRChat is a metaverse platform that \nallows users to create 3D avatars, interact with other users, and engage in \nvarious real-life experiences and games. In this tutorial, we'll learn how to \ncreate VRChat garments using EveryWear, Vroid Studio, Blender, and Unity. Before we dive into making VRChat garments, if you haven't gone through the \nbasic tutorial of EveryWear, we recommend you to learn the fundamentals \nfirst before proceeding with this tutorial. Please refer to the link provided \nat the top or in the description. VRChat Rules Guide To create items in VRChat, there are \ncertain rules you need to follow. The production rules are separated \nbased on PC and Android platforms. For PC, the mesh limit is 70,000, with \na recommended mesh count of 32,000. The maximum number of materials is \n32, with a recommended count of 4. In this tutorial, we will focus on creating \navatars and garments based on the PC version. You may find more detailed \nguidelines at the provided link. Creating an Avatar in Vroid Studio Now, let's create an avatar \nfor VRChat using Vroid Studio. Vroid Studio is a free avatar \ncreation tool provided by Pixiv, allowing easy customization of Vroid avatars. Please access the link provided at the \ntop to download and install Vroid Studio. Once installation is complete \nand Vroid Studio is opened, click \"Create New\" and choose the \ndesired gender for your avatar. To dress your avatar in the created garments, \nyou'll need an avatar without clothes. To remove default clothing, click \non the \"Outfit\" tab at the top, and delete the clothing from \nthe top and bottom menus. If you wish to wear specific shoes and socks, \nplease select and equip them accordingly. You can customize your avatar's face and hairstyle \nunder the \"Face\" and \"Hairstyle\" tabs at the top. Be cautious not to make your avatar \nexcessively large or elaborate, as it may increase the polygon count. Save the created avatar for \nfuture use or modifications. Click on the menu button at the top right, then \nclick \"Save as\" to save the file in Vroid format. Once your avatar is fully configured, export it.\nClick on the icon at the top right, then select \"Export as VRM.\"\nA window will open for setting export options. Set \"Reduce Polygons\" for the body to 34, and \"Reduce Materials\" for materials to 2. Then, click the \"Export\" button. When the VRM Settings window \nappears, fill in the information, select VRM 0.0, enter the \nTitle and Creator details, and click the \"Export\" button at the bottom. Please specify the saving \npath to save the .vrm file. Avatar Format Conversion in Blender Blender Installation Please download the file from the \nlink above to install Blender. For this tutorial, we will use Blender 3.0.1. Installing the Cats plugin To utilize Vroid avatars \nfor 3D garments in Blender, you need to convert the file format. We'll \nutilize the Cats plugin, as it's necessary for this format conversion process.\nPlease go to the link provided at the top to download the plugin and follow \nthe guide to install it in Blender. Go to the top menu - Edit - Preferences - Add-ons, click the Install button, \nand open the downloaded file. Check the installed Cats Blender \nPlugin to activate its features. VRM to FBX Conversion Once the plugin is installed, click on the \nnewly added Cats tab on the right side. Select Import Model - VRM, and choose the avatar \nfile in .vrm format that you want to import. In the Import window, select the option \n\"Extract texture images into the folder\" on the right side to import. Click on the icon next to \"Fix \nModel\" in the Cats add-on, select the same options as shown on the \nscreen, then click OK and Fix Model. Once the Fix Model f process is completed, \nswitch to pose mode to test if the model has been corrected without any issues. If everything looks fine, exit the pose mode and click on Export Model. Click \n\"Continue to Export\" in the warning dialog and save it as an FBX file.\nWe'll import this FBX file as an avatar into CLO and then dress the outfit on it. Once you've finished creating the outfit, you'll likely want to save the avatar file \nprocessed with 'Fix Model' in Blender format. This will be necessary for both the outfit \nand avatar organization processes later on. Garment Conversion in EveryWear Now, let's create VRChat garments using EveryWear \nin the following order: Auto Fitting, Rigging, UV Packing, Texture Baking, and Upload.\nEveryWear offers the same functionalities within CLO and Marvelous Designer, so it's \nrecommended to use your preferred software. Downloading Garments from CONNECT The garments for the tutorial \nare available on CONNECT. Click on the link at the top to access CONNECT. Add the garments to your cart, proceed with the purchase, and then download the files. Open the downloaded garment file in CLO, and import the FBX avatar file from Blender. Auto Fitting If the avatar's size has been changed in Vroid \nStudio and the garments no longer fit properly, we recommend using the Auto Fitting feature. Auto Fitting automatically adjusts and fits \npatterns to match the size of the avatar. For a detailed tutorial on Auto \nFitting, please refer to the link above. The garments provided by CONNECT \nare fitted to the default size, so we will skip the auto fitting process \nand directly dress the outfit in avatar. Rigging Now, let's open EveryWear and proceed \nwith polygon optimization and rigging. As the first step, let's optimize \nthe polygons based on the Poly Count standards required by VRChat.\nThe polygon count for a single garment, including the avatar, should not exceed 70,000.\nPlease adjust the mesh count accordingly, keeping some room for flexibility.\nEnter the numbers and click \"Optimize.\" Once optimization is done, \nsimulate the garment again. Next, click on \"Apply\" for \nRigging to start Auto Rigging. Once Rigging is complete, click on the \nBrush icon to open the Brush window. Use the Weight Brush to make \nadjustments to the weights. Before getting into weight modification, change the pose and identify areas \nwhere you need to adjust weights. Adjust the blend mode and properties of \nthe brush while making modifications. Use the Sculpt Brush to smooth \nout surfaces or refine shapes. Once rigging adjustments are done, press \nthe Exit button to close the Brush window. UV Packing / Texture Baking Now the rigging is complete, let's switch to the Material tab in the \nEveryWear window to work on the textures. Before packing UVs, you \nneed to set the image size. Choose your desired image size in the options. Please avoid selecting too large \nsizes due to texture size limitations. Once Image and Seam Size configurations \nare done, click the Pack UVs button. Set the Packing Ratio value, \nchoose other options if necessary, and then press the Apply button to pack. Once UV packing is complete, click the \nClose button to return to the Material tab. After checking the maps you want to generate \nin Texture Baking, press the Apply button. We will keep the default settings. Once baking is complete, you can check the generated \nNormal Map and Ambient Occlusion Map. After Texture Baking is complete, \na corresponding number of materials will be generated in the Material List \nbelow, based on the number of UV tiles. If you wish to have different materials for each \npart in Unity, please separate the materials. However, for this tutorial, we will not separate \nthe material and will proceed using one material. Upload When the garment creation is finished, click the \nUpload button to open the Export options window. Since we only need the garment, \nplease do not select the avatar. Choose the necessary textures \nfrom the options below. Click OK to upload to CONNECT. Access CONNECT and download the FBX file. When you open the zip file, you will find the \nFBX file along with the texture map files. Organizing Custom Model in Blender To upload items to VRChat, Integration of the avatar and garment, deletion of \nhidden parts of the body mesh. Since EveryWear doesn't \ncurrently provide these features, we'll proceed with these tasks in Blender. Import FBX, Fix Model Open the Blender file of the avatar that you \nsaved in the previous format conversion process. In the top menu bar, click File - Import - FBX to \nopen the garment FBX file downloaded from CONNECT. Keep the file settings on the right \nunchanged and import it as is. Delete the Collection in the \nScene Collection on the top right. On the top right in the Scene Collection, you \ncan see that the avatar is imported as Armature, and the garment is imported as Armature.001. Select the Armature.001 under Null and, \nwhile holding down Shift, drag it downward. Since the Transform of Armature.001 \nhas changed, select Armature.001, then change the Scale to 0.01 and Rotation \nX to 0 in the Transform on the bottom right. Delete the unnecessary NULL at the bottom. Select Armature.001, set the options as shown \nin the image, and proceed with Fix Model. Delete Body Mesh We'll remove the hidden body mesh \nthat is covered by the garment. Select the Body, switch to Edit \nmode either by clicking on Edit mode in the top left or pressing the Tab key. If you want to select both sides at once, \npress Alt+Z to switch to X-ray mode. Then, drag to select the parts \nof the body you want to delete. Afterward, choose Delete - Vertices to remove \nthe mesh. Adjust the Viewport mode if necessary. Merge Avatar If deleting the hidden body mesh is complete, \nlet's merge the avatar and garment into one. Select the Armature (Avatar) first, and Ctrl \nselect (ctrl+select) Armature.001 (Garment). Then, in the Cats add-on - Custom Model Creation, choose the options as shown in the \nimage, and click Merge Armature. This will combine the two bones into one. If the avatar and garment are merged, let's \ncheck for any errors by adjusting the pose. Select the bone, then change to Pose \nmode either by switching to it in the upper right corner or by pressing Ctrl+Tab. Choose the bone you want to move and check if both \nthe avatar and garment move smoothly when rotated. Eye tracking and lipsync for the avatar \ncan also be configured in the Cats add-on. You can set up eye tracking in the Eye \nTracking tab and lipsync in the Visemes tab. Export FBX When all the tasks are completed in Blender, export it in FBX format. Click on the \n'Export Model' at the top of the Cats add-on. Specify the file name and path, change \nthe Path Mode on the right to 'Copy', and click 'Export FBX' to save. Custom Model Setup in Unity In Unity, we'll proceed with avatar settings, shader configurations, format \nchanges, and VRChat upload tasks. Install To install Unity, please refer to the official \nVRChat guide link at the top and install Unity Hub along with the recommended \nversion, 2022.3.6. (As of March 2024) Unity Hub download link VRChat \n- Unity version guide link To set up VRChat avatars in Unity, you need to \ninstall the Creator Companion provided by VRChat. Please visit the link at the \ntop, download, and install it. Once the installation is complete, choose 'Create New Project' and \nselect 'Unity 2022 Avatar Project.' Set the project name and storage location, then \nclick the 'Create Project' button at the bottom. In the next step, click 'Open \nproject' to open the project. If the installation is successful, you will \nsee the VRChat SDK tab in the top toolbar. Importing and setting Now, let's import the custom model file. In the bottom Asset window, right-click - \nCreate - Folder to create a 'Model' folder. Drag and drop the FBX file exported from \nBlender into the folder you just created. If you drag and drop the FBX \nfile from the Asset window to the Hierarchy window in the top left, \nthe avatar will appear in the Scene. If the avatar isn't visible in the Scene, press 'F' to focus on the avatar \nand adjust its visibility. Select the 'Model.fbx' in the Asset window, then click on the 'Rig' tab in \nthe top right Inspector window. Change the 'Animation type' to \n'Humanoid' and click the 'Apply' button. Click the 'Configure' button to check for any \nissues if it is activated, then click 'Done.' Material & Shader Now, let's proceed to set up the Shader. Select the 'Model.fbx' file \nin the bottom Asset window, then click on the 'Materials' tab \nin the top right Inspector window. Choose 'Extract Textures...' and select \nthe same folder to load the textures. If a notification appears, click 'Fix Now.' Follow the same steps for \n'Extract Materials' below. This will generate Materials, and they \nwill automatically be applied to the model. Next, let's make adjustments \nto the texture and material settings for the transparent parts of the avatar. Select the imported texture image, activate 'Alpha is Transparency' in the right \nInspector window, and click 'Apply' below. Choose the generated Materials, then change the 'Rendering Mode' to \n'Cutout' in the right Inspector window. We will be using the Poyomi toon shader as it \nis the preferred shader among VRChat users. Please download it from the provided link. Once you've downloaded the file, simply \ndrag and drop it into the Asset folder. Go back to the Model folder, select the Material, and in the Inspector window, change \nthe Shader to the Poiyomi toon shader. After the change, in the Rendering \nmenu, set Cull to 'Off' to enable double-sided rendering of the garment. You can adjust other detailed properties in the \nInspector window to create the desired material. Avatar Descriptor To upload an avatar to VRChat, Avatar \nDescriptor configuration is essential. Select 'model.fbx' from the \nHierarchy on the top left, then click 'Add component' on the \nright to add a VRC Avatar Descriptor. Click 'Edit' in the View to adjust \nthe viewpoint through the gizmo, ensuring it fits between the eyes. Once adjustments are complete, \nclick the 'Return' button. You can also set up Lip Sync and Eye Look here. If you select \"Auto Detect,\" it will \nautomatically recognize Lip Sync, and when Lip Sync is enabled, the avatar's mouth will synchronize with the user's speech \nwhen using the microphone in the VRChat. Enabling the 'Eye Look' allows users to blink \ntheir eyes or move their pupils within VRChat. To set up Eye Look, click 'Enable' and apply the same values as shown in the \nimage for both Eyes and Eyelids. Uploading and Playing to VRChat VRChat upload Alright, we've completed all \nthe necessary setups in Unity. Now, let's open the SDK window to \ninput avatar information and run necessary validation checks \nfor uploading to VRChat. Navigate to the VRChat SDK tab at the top of \nthe menu, and click on 'Show Control Panel.' Once the VRChat SDK window appears, please log in. Confirm that the desired avatar is properly \nselected in the 'Selected Avatar' section. Enter the necessary information \nin the 'Avatar Info' section. You can set the visibility to \nPrivate or Public under 'Visibility.' In the 'Thumbnail' tab, you can \ninsert a custom thumbnail you've created or capture an image from Unity's Scene. Set it to your preferred thumbnail. In the 'Validation' section, press the 'Auto \nFix' button to address any issues automatically. Once the configuration is complete, go \nto the 'Build' tab, check the 'Online Publishing' checkbox, and click 'Build & Publish.' Once the upload is finished, click \non the 'See it on the VRChat Website' button to verify if the upload was \nsuccessful on the VRChat website. If you encounter any difficulties at this \nstage, please check your VRChat account rating. To register a new avatar on VRChat, you \nmust attain at least the rank of 'New User.' Play in VRChat Alright, let's now check if \nboth the avatar and garments have been successfully uploaded and \nfunction correctly within VRChat. To play on your desktop, please \nopen VRChat through Steam. If you don't have Steam installed, proceed to download and install it \nfrom the link provided at the top. After logging in, navigate to the eHome \nf that is the default space in VRChat. Use the [W], [A], [S], [D] keys \nto move towards the Mirror. Press the ESC key to open the Launch Pad, then select the uploaded \navatar under Avatar - Uploaded. Click the 'Change Into Avatar' \nbutton to switch avatars. Close the Launch Pad by pressing ESC \nagain and move around in front of the mirror to see everything is functioning properly. Press the Spacebar to jump, \nand press 'C' to crouch. If there are any issues, please return \nto the problematic areas (CLO, Blender, or Unity) and make the necessary corrections. If everything is good to go, enjoy playing \nwith the avatar you've created in VRChat. So far, we have covered the process of creating \nVRChat garments using EveryWear in this tutorial.

        "Transcript": "hey all you clovers so my name is Phoebe and today I'm going to walk you through this great feature it's the swap replace pattern outlines so it's really great it's going to make your editing like even faster and easier in clo than ever before um I think it's going to be really really valuable for all you Tech designers pattern makers anybody who just wants to edit patterns really easily so let's Jump On In and have some fun while we learn all right so let's talk about the pattern swap line tool right the swap pattern outline tool before we start let's like get in the mental space to think about this right so like editing and creating and all of that all right cool mental space now let me zoom in to this sleeve this is a great example of when this is great right so here you have a sleeve and you're like oh I need to edit the side right you're like I got to do some editing and I'm going to add in a curve Point adjust this around maybe make another adjustment who knows and then you're like H you're kidding me right cuz now you're just like crap the curve that I just did here I have to somehow magically make sure I did the exact same curve here and then you're like that's not what I wanted don't worry now if you go to your edit pattern tool select that line right right click copy then you can select this line right click replace so you can replace the line then you'll get this popup you can decide if you want it to start both or end you could also flip but the curve is perfect so we're good so I'm going to stick actually with where it's at and then I'm going to hit like for the direction for start and I'm going to hit okay because this line is a little bit longer than this one so it's just like replacing everything about it it replaces the curve the length all of it and now we've got a line that's completely replaced I can go and edit this a little bit again so that it's back to that like a little bit shorter length that I wanted before and all of that pretty nifty right let's do it again on another harder section right so here I've got a little bit of a harder section I've got one continuous line and then I've got another line that's all broken up and anything that I do to this line will probably affect this a little bit especially if I lengthen this so that means also I've got to take into account this part do you think this will work the answer is yes we did so let's say I move this in a bit I adjust this curve just slightly and I lengthen this now you're probably like Phoebe you sure yes I can just select all the part that I want copied so it's this whole part right click copy then select all of the lines that need to be replaced so that's all of these then I can right click replace pretty great and again this curve is perfect so I'm all good I just need to make sure I pick the right direction and again start is right and I'm like okay we're great hit okay and I again can like go in and you know like edit this around make sure like it's nice and curved out properly all that that was way too much and adjust this now so far all of my curves have been perfect and they've been lining up properly so you're probably like Phoebe why did you even create this um option for flipping right this option this option for flipping well because sometimes you not every pattern is created so that all the directions go the same way you also are probably asking me like okay Phoebe so like what are the actual limitations here like what can I expect to do what can't I expect to do these are all really great questions let me show you so here we have some examples here I've got a sleeve let me actually edit this about so you got a sleeve also I have grading on this sleeve right gasp here I'm going to select this line right click copy select this line right click select this right click replace and he going to replace it with the grading again everything's okay I'm good with the direction of start because it is like moving this up and I'm going to hit okay let's do something a little bit more difficult like this let's make it just so you can see like what is replaced by what let's select this point and make this smaller grading right so here I'm going to add like some curvature to this and everything I'm going to go to my edit pattern tool select this line right click copy then I'm going to select this line right click replace line so this is a great example of when we need the flipping okay as I'm replacing this line and yes sometimes you would want the side seam to account for the like what you're taking in here to account for take like it needs to go out this time I don't want it I want it to go in so I can use these Direction options so I could flip horizontal which will then move this in there's also flip vertical which will then flip it vertical or flip horizontal which will flip it horizontal I can then hit okay and as you can see the grading is just being updated with the line it's not replacing the grading it's replacing the line so the grading that you have app stays but the line's like shape is changing so even though this is different grading it doesn't affect this grading because it's not copying and pasting grading it's copying and pasting the shape of the lines so good to know right like happy facts let's now go to something a little bit more complicated here I have a dart so here I have a dart all right this is what won't work right if I select this line and this line and I hit right click copy and then I select this line replace line will not even come up so I'll right click and you don't see replace line now do you there's no replace line nope not for you however if you select this line hold down shift select the dart and select this line then rightclick copy then you can select this right click and replace line will come up let me just show you what happens if I do replace line because what I have done to this line is I've lengthened it and I've put in a dart and I've shortened this and all everything so I'm going to select this whole line right click copy select this line right click replace and you also see now like the dart's coming out this is going up you're like woo there's a lot lot of adjustments we've got to make here again we added these Direction options and flipping options because not every pattern is always created where every line that you're going to copy and replace goes in the right direction not like everything's going to match up perfectly so we have these options for you in this popup for you to then create and like match that line to how you want it to be so that's why we have the direction options for start both or end right I want end that's why we have the flip vertical or flip horizontal I just want flip vertical and flip horizontal or I just want flip vertical so the flip vertical is the one I want you play around a bit with this um it all like really is dependent on how this your lines were created based off of what you want for flipping so there's no like perfect recipe I can give you right now to say like oh if like it's this and your Line's this it always is this no sometimes you just have to play to see because we don't know like how that line was drawn or created or anything so it sometimes has to do with that so for this one flip vertical is the way I want to go as you can see though this bottom line is wonky based off of this line so if I just hit okay this is going to be a little bit like wish it was better again what I can do though if I really want like this entire shape to be mimicked here I'll select all the lines that I want mimicked so I can select even a corner section like this I can rightclick and copy and then I can select these two lines right click and replace now again you're like ooh this is interesting again we're going to do end and I'm going to say flip vertical and perfect right so sometimes again like I remembered last time flip vertical was perfect so this time flip vertical is perfect because the lines haven't changed right like how I created the lines haven't changed so then I'll hit okay and it's looking pretty great great right so even with darts you can but again you have to like select the whole thing if I went to just edit this line now right and then I selected this and then this it will work and again I can like flip vertical and hit okay and it's all good now if you have just like a a point in the middle here but again it's like connects to one full line I can select this right click copy and then just select the one line right click replace line so it does work like where you can select multiple lines and like change it to one line or you can select one line and change it to multiple lines and have it all like do the one where they're all adjust based off of like the one as I showed before so I could like select this right click copy and then select both of these right click replace and then they will be replaced I'll hit okay like so right like they're replaced to being this straight I can also do the same right like the reverse I can select these two lines right click copy to this one line and right click replace and again I'll say end but I'll see like the bottom here I'll be like again this is wonky so what I can always do is select all three of these right click and copy but if I just select this one line I'll still be able to replace the line because this is all connected I'll still be able to replace the line so the option will still come up but you'll start to see like what is happening here right like that's what you will ask yourself and it creates like a completely new shape that you never expected because you're not selecting the right shape to like change out to and you're not selecting enough lines to change out to kind of it will work so you can create something crazy if you wanted to or something like really fun and interesting um but like just so you know so he here if I select the actual corner I can right click and replace lines and end and hit okay great this also works with facings as well so here I have like my neck opening and again make sure I select the whole thing right click copy then I'm going to select this whole thing right click replace line I'm going to flip horizontal I like the start I'm going to hit okay all good now here's something you should also know this does not work from pattern outline to internal line so if I select this right click copy it will not work with my internal line you see there's no replace option it will work though from internal line copy to pattern outline replace so it will work from internal line to pattern outline but not the other way around so let's just refresh a little bit on what does work and what doesn't work if you have a separate pattern right pattern piece so that they're cut like this and I select these two right click and copy I cannot replace one line if they are separate pattern pieces or separated out by a dart like this right will not happen if you select the whole Dart and the whole pattern piece like this and copy and then select all of this as well it will work the biggest limitation is if you have two separate pattern pieces and you try to copy them to paste to one line you won't be able to thank you so much for watching the video I hope you had a lot of fun learning this great new feature uh we're really proud of it here at CL and we hope you have really fun editing your patterns now if you have any questions go into the comment section below

        "Transcript": "hi my name is Phoebe today we're going to go through the new 2024 release everyone here at CL virtual of fashion has been working really hard to get you all of these exciting new features we cannot wait to share them with you so let's dive on in and have some fun while we learn before we even open up CL let's talk about some of the adjustments we've made to logins for individual users now individual users only need one ID to gain access to everything CL virtual fashion has to offer so that includes MD CL Clos set connect and Jenny one ID to access them all when logging into the website or the software there have been changes to make sure that this one ID gives you access to everything everywhere the main ID that will be used will be tied to closet please no that doesn't mean you need to have a closet account or you need to be using closet for this ID to work it's just the ID that's tying it all together the software signin window will also have the option for you to use your close set ID or you can use your ID to just and password to just sign in we have updated our UI a bit in this release to create a more uniform and standardized look within CL so here you see the previous 7.3 UI and in the 20240 UI not much has changed we've only updated a few things the top two is our color and font we've just made those more standardized and uniformed along the way also we've optimized our modular library to only one on the left side along with the left side in our library we've updated those download icons we've also updated our clo project file icons within the computer to make selecting the correct project file even easier along with updating our toggle menus to be easier for visibility and use so instead of a horizontal drop down it's now vertical and we've updated our tool images in the object browser for a refreshed look going back to our modular update now when you bring in a file that was part of the older modular Library a pop-up window will come up this tells you that is CL acknowledges that there was an older modular file in CL but it is not saved in the modular Library you still have to go through and save it out where you'd want it to be in your modular Library also we've made it possible to decide where all of your new modular files should automatically be saved within your user settings now you have the ability to export and import USD files this is currently just for simulation file information and we hope that this will lead to better file exchanges with more 3D softwares and more updates will follow with a USD continuing with this seamless connection between our softwares and platforms you now can go into the connect Library within CL here and then bring in one of these new avatars again from the connect library but it's inside of Cl and seamlessly edit them with our Avatar editor this makes it easier to customize your avatars all within CL we have also improved our bounding volumes for multiple avatars along with our Arrangement points for our avatars so as you can see while having multiple avatars within a window you can now have Bond bounding volumes on all of them you can also see that our Arrangement points have been updated a bit so our arrang ment points are now linked to joints so when you adjust the Avatar pose or size the arrangement points will seamlessly adjust with it we now have the ability to change mesh type from triangle to quad optimized when using this option you'll be able to edit faster along with exporting smaller file sizes out and everything you can now copy and replace pattern outlines simply edit and adjust one line copy that line and replace its partner there's multiple options when replacing the line with Direction and flipping all of this allows for faster and more efficient editing within CL really exciting and fun we also have updated our walk pattern tool so it can now detect darts within a pattern note it has to be a clo Dart but it can adjust when you're walking the path pattern to calculate for that Dart and walk your pattern seamlessly you can also now hide and show just the angles of a pattern so you can hide and show the Angles and still have the line lengths or just have the angles no line lengths all of the options are open to you holding down shift and selecting multiple curve points you can now turn those into segment points with a simple click we have updated our nesting algorithm for better consumption rates and everything but we've also added the ability to set your own time for how long you want nesting to take within the settings tool and you can also adjust between the actual print pattern size and the shrinkage or growth pattern size in P you can now view either your 3D line length or your 2D line length through just checking on this button using the edit graphic tool and right-clicking on the graphic you can then create these custom measurements from the graphic to any point in the patterns outline the measurements can be found in the property editor and this can be exported in the Json files using the edit graphic tool again and right-clicking on the graphic you can trace as internal lines you can now Trace out Graphics using internal lines this can be used for multiple things from creating graphic patches to helping in production workflows you can even see some graphics here using this in CL you can now get more realistic knitting than ever before changing your type type to knitwear within the property editor will change out the mesh to a three-dimensional version from there you're able to adjust the knitting further different knit stitches will have 11 presets to use for now you can also adjust your knits further through the gauge and yarn thickness the higher the number for gauge the more stitches per inch the higher the number for yarn thickness the chunkier the yarn is you can keep adjusting this further by generating true knit seams or turning them off for more cut and sew look there's also now the ability to change out each ply color for maral Knit look which is also really cool you can see through these renders just how realistic this new knitting feature looks selecting the zipper polar in the property editor you can now choose between one or two a zippers there is bottom to bottom or head to head head to head is great for backs as you can see these zippers are still completely functional so you can zip them up and down while also moving and adjusting the patterns so this is also great for garments again you can select the zipper pullar choose two way and you will then have the option of bottom to bottom or head to head I believe bottom to bottom best for garments and also as you can see it's still completely functional so you can zip and unzip to your heart's Delight if the trim is glued to a pattern you can easily copy and paste that pattern within the 3D window and your trim will follow the pattern and it will stay glue to the pattern as well when bringing in hard objects as scenes or props you can turn on or off the Collision of that object allowing for the patterns within the window to drape on top of them or just drape without them even being there you now have the ability to add in multiple Wing controllers within the 3D window you can choose which to activate and adjust each separately you can now use this face swap feature that we partnered with NVA for with all of our types of avatars so boys girls men women everyone the concept has stayed the same so you can select a gender select the age you can then also select ethnicity and then you have the option of writing in your own text prompt or having one randomly generated for you you will then generate an image and all of these images that you generate can be found in your history you can then go through and convert any of these images to the corresponding Avatar's face as you've been seeing here and then use these images for renders and everything to get a more more realistic look when you render out your garment for e-commerce or more within our render window you can now choose to have a transparent background for animated or turntable renders just make sure they're saved as uh gifts or gifs not as a video and you'll be golden thank you all so much for watching and for making it to the end congrats we hope you all enjoyed the new features if you want to learn more check out our YouTube page for in-depth tutorials more are coming soon and have fun building with Clow 2024 and again thank you all so much for watching ",

        "publishedAt": "2024-03-01T14:00:19Z",
        "Transcript": "hello hi everyone welcome let us know in the chat from where you're joining we just started the session if you don't know the academic month is started in October 18 and today is the last session unfortunately every Wednesday since October um 18 we invited schools to Showcase their work to Showcase how they've implemented cl to their curriculum and before I tell you a bit more about the academic month I would like to introduce myself so my name is Fernanda I'm the academic lead for claw Europe um I joined claw in 2021 as a 3D designer my background is in fashion design and today my work is to support schools when implementing claw today or curriculum CL so from training to licenses any support needed please if you want to um start teaching Claw at your school drop us a message you can see on the screen um a link to our contact us page um yeah there it is the link so feel free to write to us if you have any questions about implementation or if you want to know more about how to um how to teach CL at your school today with me we have the University of Hanover of Applied Science and Arts I will introduce you to them very soon before I just would like to tell you a bit more about the academic month so the purpose of the academic month is to give the stat to universities so they can share their projects and share with us how they've implemented cl to their your curriculum we have so many great stories and we think that this needs to be shared so we can learn with one another and also Inspire those who are still in the implementation process um if you don't know the academic month is started two years ago in 2021 we have all sessions recorded and you can find them in our YouTube channel uh there is a playlist with all the recordings from the past editions you can click here it will take you there so soon we will have all the sessions from this year there as well I see that many people have already joined past sessions but it's the first time that you are coming uh in October 18 we started with istituto secoli they are well known for their pattern making classes and they shared with us how they've implemented clo to their pattern making courses then we had three schools um design school Co coding University of Luana and a university of William de coning um Academy they shared with us how they've applied for Erasmus Plus funding um how they joined forces and successfully managed to get the funding for a 3D fashion education program so in this case was not about implementation but it was um about an important topic that many people also wants to know more how you can apply for Rasmus plus funding so they shared all the process with us then we had shape M size um with the University of arts and Bourn mouth they shared how spoke avatars can improve inclusivity fit and sustainability this talk was all about body scanning so if you want to know more about it I rightly recommend to have a look at um shape not size and last week we had implementation from scratch with the German International University from kaido they showcase how they've implemented clo to their fashion curriculum and what was really um nice about this talk was that they also showcase how they run interdisciplinary projects with the computer and science department so I also highly recommend having a look at this one today finally we have real mids digital with Hanover University of Applied Science and Arts and they will show us how they brought back the Garment from a Duke of the 16th century can't wait to hear all about it here it's an invitation for you if you'd like to Showcase your work please join us on the academic month of 2024 just drop us a message let us know if you'd like to show the work you've been doing at your school without further Ado i' would like to invite to the stage the University of Hanover Sylvia why don't you um start by uh introducing yourself and the project can you hear me yes I can yes wonderful thank you vanand so um hello everyone from my side too um we the morets team welcome you to our presentation real meets digital uh my name as Fernanda told you is syvia bosens and I will guide you through the first part of our presentation um we are also very happy that you all here and that you are so interested in our Moritz um as you may already know um our Moritz project is an open and participative research project uh therefore we are happy about every hint that helps us to unravel the mysteries of Moritz we want to know what you think that's important to us um and so you're welcome to take notes during the presentation use the chat and write down questions to discuss them with us afterwards um please feel invited to do so um before I go ahead now one more thing for your information we will take a short break after about um 20 minutes now we come to the Duke Duke morit of Saxony lorg had to leave the ruling to his older brother France the II um he himself lived for rent with his mistress and her husband in book Huda however um as insignificant and chronically peniles he may have been for his time this insignificance is the reason that an extraordinary unique collection of clothing from his possessions around 1600 has survived centuries and is preserved in Hanover's museums um because clothing from this time is not only rarely handed down um above all it is an absolute Stroke of Luck that almost the entire wardrobe robe of a noble gentleman from this time is preserved um in this presentation we will show you how we bring this valuable 16th century Legacy to life with the help of close 3D and short what awaits you now um here a short overview um after the introduction where we tell you who we are and where clo 3D comes into play uh we have two big topic blocks the first one um is the preservation of cultural heritage uh we will introduce you to the research project and how close 3D contributes to cultural heritage preservation after that in the second block we will take a closer look at the research work in progress and conclude uh with an interim result where Moritz comes to life and um at the end an Outlook um of how the journey goes on as I told you before I'm Sylvia bosens um and I work as a teacher for special tasks in the intersecting fields of costume fashion media and product design um my passion is working with students in the process of developing shapes especially those made of textile materials um my part in our research project is the project coordination the 2D digitalization the development of teaching and learning Concepts especially for the linking of research and teaching as well as the 3D clothing uh clothing simulation hello everyone my name is Christian G and our work as a lecture and supports areas of 3D animation and visual effects with the focus on sound design in the project I was directly or indirectly involved in different tasks for example the 3D photogrammetry process texturing and so on and so on I'm kast beam and I'm teaching patent development and CAD Technologies for fashion design at hanova University of applian Sciences and arts and for many years I have also been working with various 3D simulation programs and in our Moritz project I was mainly concerned with the digitization of the analog sewing patterns of Mor's clothing my name is timnit I'm a professor for 3D animation and visual effects I'm teaching various courses from to ffix to media design informatics I worked over 11 years in one of Europe's leading Studios for Cinema animation films and high quality media production for theme and amusement parks which is now called MC animation and here are the other people who complete our core Ms Team without CLA our electrical engineer and Technical Support there would have been no photogrametry he developed the light setup of the box for the recording in the museum Mara is our great support when it comes to simulating Mor's cloes as a costume designer who also studied at our University she now works as a CG costume design expert Maya she initiated our project she's also the one who's responsible for a wonderful Mo's website and as part of the museum team next to Yan villan she's responsible for the cultural historical research and processing of the estate as a freelance uh she re conceives and coordinates and realizes interdisciplinary projects for culture and science andan Willam he's the head of the education and communication department at the Historical Museum hanova his topics are Museum education participation digitalization and Outreach and now let's briefly take a look at some impression of our University where we work as a regionally anchored and internationally oriented University the hanova University of applied sciences and arts offers a broad selection of application oriented degree programs obviously our faculty is the most beautiful and diverse one we are working here at the design and media Department our faculty will offer a wide variety of 15 bachelor's degree programs this list clearly shows how our diverse orientation that we offer with our Bachelor degrees in addition there are our four master degree programs that round off the range of studies and so and now some insights of our design Basics and some images about our workshops some of our impression of our workshops for fashion and costume design and here you can see our CNC milling machine at work in the rapid prototyping Department cut and Rapid prototype or ba and of course we have the wood workshop and the metal workshop and as you can see we both work in analog and digital worlds in the basement there's our photo studio and right next to it the film studio with green screen and motion capturing possibilities and lots of digital studios are spread throughout the whole building here you can see uh the preparation of an exhibition in our big Atrium and an exhibition on one of our balconies and theater performances take place on our studio stage which was a cooporation with the degree program stenography costume experimental design at the Hanover University of musique drama and media we organize fashion design shows and to wrap up all these Impressions there the motion Cube our annual festival for film animation and digital worlds we also have the international study program at our school please contact our colleagues if you are interested and uh now back to close we and where it comes into play for for us um also close 3D calls a software 3D fashion design software uh we actually use it in three other design courses apart from Fashion Design um the first is in media design we use it for 3D animation um in product design wherever textile materials are used in the product and innography costume experimental design for computer generated costume questions so we have't have it in different kind of courses in my basic courses on pattern making I use close 3D to explain how to get from 2D to 3D form um for me working with close 3D promotes an understanding of the workflow uh on of how to get from a 2d design idea to a 3D form um I start from a rectangle which is modeled through modifications until it is optimally adapted uh to the body shape you can see that on the left side in the pictures um so for example the Torso and sleaves it also serves as a quick check of an idea as you can see here on the right side um there you can see um a conductor's code and it's the Quick Check of this conductor's code this designed for a performance and the original costume in the performance you can see um at the bottom right here are some Impressions from our different draft projects we have shorttime draft semester draft projects and cross disciplinary projects and of course Bachelor Theses are also done with clue Corona has really speeded this up and here an example for bais for bais from Gabriela Ramirez um these are I would say the conventional areas where we use close 3D I think you all know them um now we want to introduce you to a new special application area away from the classical use of close 3D and we called that um the preservation of cultural Heritage and the role of close 3D in this context um for this we use the example of our research project we call it Architects 2.0 or mors from books to Huda so what is our research project Mor from book to Huda all about first the question what do you think how long do you look at a piece of clothing or another artwork in museum there's a poll you can answer and I would say please guess give you a couple of seconds more so less than 10 seconds less than a minute minute less than five minutes less than 10 minutes what do you think how long do you look at piece of clothing or another artwork in a museum okay I think almost uh yes 43% I think that you look less than five minutes and only three no 5% 4% think that you look less than second uh 10 seconds um the solution is a German art magazine monopole estimates that art viewers spend an average of 4 seconds four seconds in front of a painting today so you have only four seconds to catch the interest you would probably look at morit for longer than 4 seconds 20 uh 42% of you look longer than or at least almost five minutes um but we asked us what about all those who have no connection to historical clothing um and what would could motivate someone to want to know more to stay longer or to pull the cell phone aside or perhaps use it to get more information we want to get especially young people into museums so how we can we get young people in particular interested in visiting a museum our answer was probably not with a lifeless bust in a display case and for that um that leads us to one of the goals of our research project um and that is to find new ways to present historical textile objects in a more exciting interesting way as you know textile objects are very delicate and decompose quickly under light and air and that is why they are rarely exhibited so how can we preserve them and make them visible at the the same time that's really um a difficult question and that's another goal um the other goal is to create a digital Arc that will protect texti cultural assets from Oblivion and thus one day take over the testimony of The Originals now we would like to introduce our cooperation partner the hisor museum hanua the 119 years old Museum shows the history of the city from the Middle Ages to present the collection contains about 500,000 pieces of cultural artifacts and a photo stock of more than 2.4 million pictures the permanent exhibition is currently being redesigned and therefore closed Moritz will certainly become part of the permanent exhibition after the reopening the Museum of History hisory is a gold mine for all who are interested in the history of the state or the city and for us in particular the estate would not exist without the Historical Museum hanova here you see the estate of Duke Moritz consisting of 24 objects like a cape a rose summer du a red velvet duet red velvet breaches a green silk footer hand lined shirt two linen shirts a rough hats shoes breath clothes and kives only a few pieces were displayed in the Museum's exhibition you can see the Showcase in the framed picture how to handle such a complex task in the first step we selected eight objects that we wanted to examine more closely with our selection we wanted to be able to dress Moritz from the moment he gets up until he goes to bed the goal was to digitally secure the information from the real objects the task where divided the real part was taken by the museum the digital part by the university the museum has started with an art historical reappraisal and a textile restorative um examination not only the provenance research on the Museum's collection object was of interest but also information on details of the claing where and how it was made and in general who Moritz was the opening of The Archives and the viewing and the analyzis of the objects were another step after the necessary safeguards on the textiles the textile restorer kmen Market manually removed the cut shapes the patterns finally we had a lot of new information about Moritz and also the 2D patterns in tyac for further processing since this is an interdisciplinary citizen science project we asked ourselves how to make this project accessible for the public from these considerations the website was created which makes the individual steps of the research visible there will also be a book publication on cultural history research on Moritz in the spring of 2024 here you can see the landing page from the very beginning it was clear to us that we would not be able to achieve our goals which the resources of the museum and the univ university alone so we have been looking for partners and supporters and are pleased that we are receiving support from close 3D in addition to the VG foundation and the Hines and Nani GAA Foundation now let's switch from The Real World to the digital world to be created by Moritz and close Rd in the context of cultural heritage preservation here you see one original linen shirt and now you can see the simulation of it let's dive into Heritage preservation and explain a little more about the process you see in the pictures after the pieces from the collection of the Historical Museum of hanova had been restored we had to determine an order of what what we would work on First and what later which parts would be best communicate our concern the green footer Hamp and the red dublet with breaches should definitely be there now let's take a closer look at the process for the three objects the data acquisition we use two methods photogrammetry and the hand scanner Artic AA we wanted to develop a workflow that would suit the situations in different locations the objects should not have to leave the museum the goal was a cost effective mobile setup in an initial series of tests at the University we tried Out handling of the scanner and the photogrametry technque on Sample garments here you can see us in action in our green box at the univers and we go further on for understanding a short explanation of the term photogrammetry photogrammetry uses cameras to capture a 3D seen from multiple perspectives the cameras are moved around the object on different levels the are linked using corresponding points that can be seen in multiple overlapping images Each of which can be precisely located in order to require only one camera teimo built a kind of trod car to define a clear light situation in the museum we built a light cube with LED stripes on the ceiling and thanks CLA that you put this um light stripe and the cube itself for higher accuracy and the later calculation in the software Mark marker points were attached to the WS also for the movement of the Tree Port it needed an exact positioning to be seen here as adhesive stripes on the floor the objects were retrieved from the museum Depot carefully unpacked and then placed on the test Dy now we could start scanning and photographing that's another video I want to show you for for all selected objects we needed two complete working days the data had to be checked the following objects wrapped in the end we had obtained a lot of data for pros processing as already mentioned we took a two track approach for the acquisition of the data first we scanned with an Arctic EA hand scanner then we used the photogrammetric method why did we do that we used the hand scanner to ensure that we at least got a digital version of the objects this gave us a backup in case the photogrammetry data did not give us the results we wanted after the data had been acquired they had to be processed in the next step now let's continue with our digital preparation the data of the Arctic EA hun scanner provides a fast and high resolution 3D geometry results but unfortunately only low resolution for photo textures for the further processing our data of the Artic if a hand scanner had to be processed in a complex procedure in the first step we need to reduce the 3D model to convert a high po mesh we used a process called rization to create a low poly version of it see the high Poly on the left and the low Poly on the right side in the Second Step the creation of a UV layout is necessary this UV layout corresponds to a pattern in the analog world you see this pattern on the left on the right side finally a third step we need to reproject high resolution photo images onto our low resolution geometry this three-step workflow was too time consuming and we rejected this manual process we decided to use the photometric photogrammetric method because it gives us excellent uh 3D geometry data and high resolution photo Textures in one step the capturing reality software takes care of all the steps in the process and it's way faster and highly automated and here you have the first three digital twins of our textile project first the linen shirt so we represent these uh comments in um turn table we call it so you can see it from all sides so the second is a red taet which is the most impressive one of these three objects and the last object is a green footer hand okay but what else besides turntables should come out in the end we wanted to have a 3D animation of Moritz as a character in a simulated clothing with detailed textures and an authentic environment with the photog grammatic data a closing simulation is unfortunately not possible therefore we wanted to take a second route to digitally save the information from the textile objects and digitized the 2D patterns that the conservator had taken for further use we did this using two techniques to find out the best process not only for our Museum but also for others the first way was to digitize directly with the DIY board into the CAD software graphis and the second way was to photograph the pattern together with a reference rectangle these photos are later rectified and scaled with a pfp software and the pattern are automatically digitized with graphs the difference does not seem to be unimportant hardly any Museum owns a DI board but probably a good camera um now we come to the point where we have brought in the students um we have advertised and started interdisciplinary courses at the University to involve our students in the Moritz project we used miror Bots um you can see an excerpt here um to work in the courses and coordinate different courses first of all we set the goals for the courses um we wanted morit to come to life in the form of an animation we asked us what did we need for it um of course we needed the research of the museum we need a story we needed in character uh a pattern the cloth simulation an environment the texturing and last but not least the animation um the first thing was that we needed a tiny story a student or students invented um a tiny story and here you can see the resulting three shots they invented and that's an excerpt of the mirobot with first information what is already available so what the students can work with for example the turntables from the photogram process then um the the patterns we digitized um and the information about mors uh from the from the museum in order to to tell our story properly we needed at first a morit we needed a body um we determined the correct proportions for the avatar from the measurements of the 2D patterns and the results of former research work uh we used the existing patterns as a guide and derived the size and body shape for the creation of the character the Avatar um for the first clothing simulations we used a cloth 3D standard Avatar whose body proportions we adjusted accordingly in parallel an actual Ms Avatar was developed that you can see here in the pictures and of course the body needs a head um the head with the head we had a bit of trouble uh Moritz was a bon viant and he was Wayne one could think at it was not uncommon at that time that there are quite a few portrays of this noble gentleman in fact there are some of his family members but not one of himself only a preserved coin gives us an impression of his face you see the coin in the picture um top left on this basis we first developed sketches and then digital 3D portrait heads with corresponding grooming so that's you can see here in the pictures the way to that and then we had an mors and we needed an environment yes an environment Al morit needs an authentic environment in which to move to do this we researched what houses in the Interiors looked like in Northern Germany around 1600 for example we used the picture guide of the flansburg city museum we used paintings with popular lighting moods from this period as an inspiration and the next step was to build interior as a 3D environment which such lightning scenes not only the chamber the light and the Avatar are important for the authentic Ambience but also all furniture works of art and home accessories unfortunately the house was destroyed so we had to reinvent the chamber in the end moros and his living space had to match after that we were able to bring it all together and the students could now think about Mor's movement and his path through the room according to the story we think that's what Mor's room might have looked like if you agree with us fine but we are not done with our simulation yet and now comes the cloth with our closing simulation we want to get as close as possible to his to the historic original that's why all the details have to be recreated exactly as an important significance in the closing simulation is the authenticity of the material and the textures again we took two different approaches to develop the textures for the Gren Lind shirt in the first approach we tried to create texture and plasticity using only normal and displacement maps in our second approach we combine these texture maps with a petting function in clue 3D to further enhance the realism here you see the results of the first approach on the left side you see the original material this a small stripe of the photograph on the left side the other picture represent the digital twins the texture maps of the fabric with the yellow scenes in this approach we have only one material layer the quilting and picity comes afterwards via the texture here you can see the normal and displacement maps of the silk of the outer fabric on the left and the fanel of the lining fabric on the footer hemp on the right and Below how it would look like on an object as you can see it does not yet reflect the real plactic of the original material therefore our second approach we combine the textures with a second layer of fabric and use the fill and padding feature of Cl 3D to increase the plactic a closeup inside closeup look inside clue 3D how we combine the two result with all the texture map in combination with the padding we think uh it looks quite real already on the lower right side you see the renderings of the arm and this is the rendered phot in a light setup there a lot of scene parameters to change the effect of the result um the result of the our first approach here a turntable with a uniform neutral lighting setup here's a green Foo H with padding so that's the result with the padding with the two layers now briefly an insight into the development of the red velvet for duet and hair poker here students started with sketches based on the original patterns as digital drawings the pattern repeat was also developed so that the material could be used for the pattern pieces in close 3D several iterations were necessary to create the desired effects all textile structures quilting embroidery steam seam structures ribbons and trimmings were prepared to match the physical properties on the fabric such as Dr white elasticity and Reflections on the left you can see the original ribbon on the red du on the right side the digital version now we were prepared to merge all components in CL 3D and here the digital ribbon on the top of the digital Fabric and at the end the position on the finished garment and let's take another step back because we haven't explained yet how the pattern Pieces come into close 3D so we go back to that um the digitized analog patterns were postprocessed in graphis and then converted to an exchange format we choose dxf and imported them pattern pieces into close withd we then chose a default material changed its color as you can see on the left side suit the pieces then together and simulated them on the proxy Avatar so you can see it's still the proxy Avatar and Mar the moris Avatar before we went any further we changed the material color back to white as this made the details easier to see for the rest of the process um the historical patterns turned out to be quite complex and time consuming for more so than modern pants and shirts in the next step we replace the proxy Avatar with the modeled morit Avatar um still working with the default material we add the depositions of the trimmings such as ribbons and others the next challenge was to put the breaches on um a challenge because in reality the breaches sit above the waistline and are attached to the dublet using Hoops you can see that in the middle in the picture this would have been too complicated for the simulation um therefore we decided uh decided to construct a waistband and tag it to the Avatar at the exact position above the waist finally that you can see on the right side um all efforts were rewarded with the first surprising clothing simulation images on the morit Avatar we know when you see this here U the fit of the Garment is not quite perfect yet and the drape of the fabric is not very vality it's too soft and too flowing still and textures and details are missing but nevertheless we were thrilled it our first virtual mors simply using a default material of red velvet slowly brought us closer to the desired look by changing the properties of the default valid material uh from close 3D we have tried to gradually approximate the actual properties of the original velvet and we are still not completely satisfied but for the time being the results seemed good enough for us to continue working with it further trimming such as the bows were added and in The Next Step the ribbons can finally be attached to the previously marked positions um and then of course Moritz needed a neck rough this is the first attempt um and we haven't reach the end here either uh for our first animation we left out the rough and concentrated on the doublet and the hair Parker and here the finished moris um what's still missing is the texture the palom grenade   pattern and here we got it Teo I think it's your turn again first we have a play blast that shows the 3D V visualization of the story board um the students uh captured moap data to determine the motion sequence for the animation oh yes he's already been given an Rick though he can move at all so this is a preview of the final animation to check if the animation is correct the closes are moving do you get a feel for the   environment okay okay and then finally it came the big moment when everything fell into place rendering was done a little bit of compositing so this is our first attempt at the realization and we know there's still a lot of room for improvement but here you can see it in motion we have not reached the end yet of our journey not all eight objects have been fully processed yet we also want to work on the approach of a fully automated 3D scanner and material scanner the linking of research and teaching using close 3D as a tool in the preservation of cultural heritage a virtual morit in the permanent Exhibition at the Historical Museum on the analog reproduction of the estate for use in museum education and reenactment part of our project was to develop a lowcost fully automated scanner to speed up the library's process of photogrammetry that we had originally envisioned after initial sketches we tried to build a model unfortunately Corona brought our efforts to anrt end therefore a working model is still in progress as you can imagine carrying out such a project is not easy as the semesters are short and the composition of the people in involved chains very very quickly so we are still looking for people with the necessary skills and now I want to show you um a video of the scanner we try to build this is an animation that shows you the process but I think it's in the future not now okay we saw big and worked out building a material scanner in parallel in future this will be available to all design courses in our faculties materials Library all scans with the resulting Maps will be available to users in a digital the library um and now almost at the end we want to say um thank you um at first a big big thank you to our students and former students um without whom what we have just shown you would not have been possible so this is in a random order this there are Peter B Mustafa far Anette Fisher Leah hild debrand Kimberly Hoffman maluna hook Nicola Yu Marcel klip longang Lena Miller Leon pman Julian reld Slava shof Victor stanovic fredun Rosal Miller Gabriela kolina Ramirez Alexander kusik and andri marker um a big big thank you to all you were were really great um and there are some other important supporters in the Moritz team that has come our textile restorator Florian and Kevin the shop managers Workshop managers of our wood and metal workshop and um Hannah nay the workshop manager of our materials Workshop they are very important also for our project thanks to you all and that's the end thank you all for your attention if you have any questions or comments um don't hesitate to share them with now I would say that me and the audience we are all actually thanking you you all for sharing this project with us it's so amazing um yeah thank you for being like so so humbled and so professional you you can see that you documented all the steps and this is so important for us to learn how it was done uh it was an amazing presentation thank you so much we have many questions from the audience um just just before we start one one thing that I I I wanted to know better is um was this part of the curriculum or did you develop this project as an elective so students could apply the ones who wanted to participate on the on the project more in the in the educational side how how was it think it's part of the curriculum but we uh the goal or the yeah the goal for us was to um combine the various bachelor degree courses from the fashion design and the costume design and the media design so each group of students bring um a little bit of um knowledge and we the lecturers uh try to orchestrate them yes I origin sorry sorry syia I was just saying I imagine it's not an easy task but it's many people involved yes there are many people involved and um we originally started it as a research project um and um we then came with the students other with the courses uh into this re research or combined the research project with uh the curriculum and that was um I think that's that's a good way to do that so research work uh gets more interesting and uh um it's also something everyone can can take part yeah no absolutely nice um I will I will jump to the questions that we have from the audience because there are many of them um um why did you do both processes of scanning the Garment and then doing also um in clo I would say it's like to have a guidance of how the the garments would be but i' would love to hear from you yeah you saw the um turntables of the photogrametry and this is um You can call it the ground truth so it's a yeah one to one uh representation of the original analog world in a computer so uh the other side from uh the garments and the patterns and uh via clo 3D you have to recreate this kind of model and I think you are right we needed it as a guidance uh that's one part and another part is of course that we wanted um to make them available for researchers uh without uh um fetching them from the depot of the museum so they could perhaps research on the digital twin yeah um and then will you do um other projects for the museum Julia is asking maybe other historical garments um yes we would like to uh we would would like to finish uh the eight objects we haven't finished them yet um and we want to uh yes be part of the uh per exhibition of the mors exhibition in the museum uh so we will work together with the museum um on on other uh other ways of presenting um um historical   objects but but from our the beginning we had a dream that in the beginning we had a dream that the digital mors can can uh uh bring the audience or take the audience through the exhibition in the digital morit will will will be the guide in the exhibition and we are talking with the people from the museum about this and when the the the exhibition will start again we will see what we can do in this way fantastic uh then you know other places where 3D dig digitalization is used for patrimonial values L um is asking so maybe other universities or other researchers that are are using um 3D for patrimonial values I don't know about this we to yeah I've been hearing quite um quite often there is also like a another researcher that that is um here present as well I think this is a topic that is is coming up um and yeah Victoria yes um Victoria I already connected her to Hanover un University um there was also another University from Switzerland so if you are working also um with other um historical um governments let us know because we always like to match the researchers and people that are working with this let us know and it will be a pleasure to to match everyone uh two last questions I promise um another one from an Ena sorry um so do you plan to integrate your workflows with other projects and or research infrastructures on National and international level I think we haven't thought so big so far but uh I think that's of it's it's really interesting um to to um think about it yes would be great in the moment we have no plan but we we will think over this as it of it if it is possible in the future because we we we have to teach our students in the basic courses and um and then we need need time for do uh connections to other national International Schools and museums and so I think the main problem is that we are a university of applied sciences and arts and not a university so the education has a much bigger uh importance for us so first comes the education of our students and then comes all the research projects on top of it it's a time consuming step it is and um the last one then we will let you go and have a a good rest after this amazing presentation from Anna so as CLW is so vast but we all learn at first how to bring patterns to life I would like to ask which areas are lacking development that new designers and students would be more than welcome to dive in in order to help the industry I think this is a a really um great question um I would love to to hear also like from syvia that I know you work directly with claw and also carsten uh this project already gives us a hint right we can use clo for um bringing back historical garments and digitizing so many archives we have so much history right um in in museums in garments that are so important yeah the project that you just presented it's a good example on how we can use claw the first step could be that we bring the young people closer to the history and so that we that they will learn about the history so they are prepared to manage the the the the present yeah and the in the work in the industry and sometimes um it's good to look at former shapes because in the moment we have even the the the same shapes in all collections and uh sometimes it's necessary to to have a new kick for this and it's uh better to look in the very very past um and learn something about the shapes and the technology and we in the beginning we had uh one uh project there they the the fashion students worked the linen shirt you have seen there with with the traditional pattern um and they modified that and brought it in her in their collections in their um daily Collections and I think that could be a way to connect the young people with the with the Heritage and to to go uh in the libraries in the museums uh yourself and and make research there for their own projects and not only in the internet no I I agree 100% I can't wait to see history of f fashion classes for example done with 3D uh because at my time when I was a f student I learned history of fashion in books printed books and sometimes they were copy of printed books so it was even worse even harder to see um the Garment and you would guess the construction of the pattern but like with this project for example I'm sure you learned so much about pattern making is the type of government that nowadays we don't have so I think it's going to be so reach for the future generation to learn about in the course of fashion design how these patterns were built um and also to see it maybe in a one to one right size and not in a printed book so I think it's going to be like spr saful and and Rich and I can't wait for fashion school to to have history of fashion classes with 3D yes and also for the for the area of costume design I think it gets very interesting uh to work with close 3D so have you have a first impression um I showed that um at the beginning uh in the basic courses uh so as a as a check check up for an idea I want to have on the stage um and I think that's a great possibility with close 3D uh to have a first impression so you can say that this works this works not um I think that's that's also for costume design it's it's a very very valuable uh tool yeah yeah and later for augmented reality to mix this and and maybe for the costume designers and for for the show business and so it may be interesting for the future and also for Museum exhibitions I think uh that could could bring uh the the younger G generation uh to go into the museum uh and visit a museum and spend a bit more time than 4 seconds in a front of something yeah yes not 100% I I want to thank you all again for sharing the project for um giving uh your time to us to talk about it um it's it's so important everyone learns so much um with this experience uh and please share with us also the the the future projects that you develop yeah it would be so nice to hear about it if they want to reach out to you how they can contact you um Mor's website Mor's website perhaps I've already added the Mor's website to the chat I can add it again I have it here yes so again yeah have a nice evening everyone thank you very much very much bye bye bye ",
