        "Transcript": "thank you   hi my name is Phoebe and today I'm going to go through an in-depth overview of the new modular library and configurator along with the modular creator we're going to go through what the old version was like compared to this new version all the different ways in which you can set up your great libraries through the modular library now and how you can save different styles and all of that stuff so let's dive on in and have something while we learn okay so we've got quite a few topics to go through so buckle up uh first thing we're gonna do is old modular mode just like bear with me through this and I promise afterwards you're gonna be like thank you for changing you might even write it in the comments or something I don't know first step we go into modular mode because it was a mode that the units on so first thing is now I'm in my mode modular mode and I had to go to modular template presets and this is interesting because now I'm realizing that I don't have a preset that matches this properly so we're just going to do a t-shirt basic we have the ribbing but the problem is with the ribbing that you don't have the color so we're going to do basic and I'm just going to delete that that's for that's the choice we're making now now here I have my modular like blocks and I now have to put all of my pattern pieces in easy peasy this is important it's pretty simple you just select your patterns and then you drag and drop them in and great what you might have noticed here in this 3D window is now things are rearranging not great but it is what's happening again all the way also you'll notice that symmetry doesn't apply when you put pattern pieces and means modular clocks remember when I said buckle up I wasn't joking um so here I'm putting my sleeves again this number tree doesn't matter now I'm putting in them all these ones now you might be asking like why did you have to do that it's because all of these blocks have predetermined connections so because of that that's why you're able to then put these pattern uses into these box to then determine the those connections that they should be in and also the placements that they should be in so then it just like automatically goes through it on the clock now what I have to do is I now have to sew resell everything so I sold everything to make this garment and now I get to resell it all to connect it all to the launcher so I'm going to do the side seams um and again don't forget that that symmetry thing that we all know and love that makes it so that you only have to do half the work it's gone so you have to do all the work again this is the old version like I'm just showing you what was so you know what is now okay this is was not what the amazing new revolutionary feature is okay the amazing one is coming don't worry it's give me a second I'm just gonna solve through all of this we kept this in for the people who like a challenge and they were like yeah let's do it so then you sold it all hopefully well not this is not the perfect picture and then you were like great now how do I say this into the library right because you want the box in the library to then play through great question this is what you do you go to then the like modular preset templates and everything and now you could say right because you're safe this is going to be called body I'm going to hit the same fantastic I'm gonna use the component thumbnail fantastic but I have to come up with another image so before I did this I actually took a snapshot so now I have a snapshot of this so you always have to make sure you have taken an image first um which I don't know about you guys but prepping is not always like the thing I'm thinking of when I first did like when I'm first like that's my library okay so then I'm going to the sleeves and I hit save I can sleep um because now I have that image for the big image that was what I had to take a picture of great now I have this and then what I would have to do is then add desktop folder and then here they are here it is a basic and everything as you see I did this twice just click through and see if this works it kind of does so then you would have to then go through and figure out what you did wrong in The Sewing and redo it all as you can see this led to some frustration however the idea is an amazing idea like this is something I know all of you want right like you want a library within clothes where you can play around put different things together so what we did for you all in 7.2 is we made this so much easier like crazy easier like you should all be doing this easier okay so let's go to the easier section that is our second part of today's lesson new modular creator workflow option one because the thing I wouldn't give you guys multiple options okay you congratulations guys you all did it check done you have gone through the hard one and now easy from here on out okay so this is the same sweatshirt all right and now what we're gonna do we're gonna do the first work phone which I thought of when we were designing this feature and it was I have a garment and I want to save it as a blah and I haven't created the group or whatever and I'm just gonna go for it okay okay file save as Style then the modular Creator comes out boom we'll talk a little bit about setting it up in a bit if you saw the well like intro don't really cover it modular creator this is it what you can do is you have group category style block group first those of you who know closed set because you want a great ecosystem workflow and you're like yeah let's do it can realize that this is very similar to how we set up close set let me tell you that wasn't a mistake that was on purpose Okay so we've got our group that you can organize it however you walk through again talk about setup options but this is like the group modular Creator I can select any of the groups that I already have so again I just like to carry over spring I also can hit this plus button okay you see the plus button I can hit that and then I can like bring in things right like I can bring in folders I can create a new folder right like modular I don't know you could say daisy spring whatever you want to do it module great it's not going and now I have the modeling folder again I'm going to go with period or spring because I'm leaning into it you double click and it will go to the next or you can select it and click category double click as fast now we have our category you know category again I mean these all as top of production samples because I was like these are carryover cells so we have a production like block prepped and ready for you so you know like it's proper however like for me I'm gonna add in it all right so I'm going to say like top woman's   sweatshirt yeah you can be like more you can say anything it's up to you sure we're all I'm just living it so again I can select it and go to the next I can double click and go to the next I'm gonna double click now we've got the style this is when the fun weekends and I'm going to hit plus because I'm adding a style because there's never been a style before look at that the thumbnail is already created here is a fun tip okay this is something fun if you remember you know how we have schematic render and if you don't know now you do there's this thing called schematic render you click on it it's right here in your 2D 3D toggle makes it so everything can kind of look like a sketch if you want it you can have texture look if you don't know it there's a video I'm sure in our YouTube channel without it you're already on our YouTube channel so you know where to find things so you can change things you can do color or Texture I'm going to stick with color and like I could change the brightness around I like it like this here's your glocking jump okay so now when I go to style and I hit plus you see how now I have like that sketching image because like it just replicates what's in your 3D window so if you have like a sketch image in the 3D window then show that kind of cool and then you can name your style so here I'm going to name my style and I'm gonna say pull over sweatshirt yeah I don't know can't think of anything fun so I'm going to say use current thumbnail because look at that I could create a new thumbnail which would then just lead me into here and then I can pick something I'm going to say climb hit okay now I've got this now I can click here and we've got our blocks out now we're creating those blocks okay don't worry life is still easy um two options you can go to this little file open and guess what I provided to all of you you all have blocked presets you see here long presets you all have it I know because I gave it to you all during 7.2 you can use any one of these presets to automatically load it in okay so I can say I want to load in like the basic setting and hit open and all of this will automatically load in so you don't have to like go in an app you can also save your own I said I have front body back body sleep and collar but I still need that half past me half so what I'm going to do is I'm going to hit this plus button and in my blocks here I see that there's a hem option there's a lot of options okay have fun look through it all pick what you want I'm gonna pick up you can rename this too so I can name it pesky hemp I'm not going to but I could um I want to hit okay now I have 10. now we have the information of what these blocks are amazing I'm gonna now go to front body and I'm going to select all the pattern pieces that I want to be in that front body block that from body in the pocket okay then all I have to do is hit enter on my keyboard then look at this okay image is automatically made the name is automatically made and it's even like if you want to do more work you could create a new thumbnail or you could just let go do the work for you up to you and again if you wanted to stay on that whole like sketchy bottom you could and then you can just select all of this hit enter and look at that it looks like a sketch boom you're like great thought of me okay then I can go to back body enter that sleeves here's a fun trick okay actually um well I can do before I like select my face is now I can select all of this right click buy 3D patterns that I only see this one sleeve and also like my sleeves it just makes sense about the image is nicer honestly it's all on how much you care I've done this enough times that now I care a lot and I can do the caller hit enter cancel because now I don't see anything I'm just going to show everything again um and last but not least that pesky hem okay check and done now I have done all of my blocks in a matter of seconds and I now hit okay what color is now doing because it's saying hey check your timeline because you need to make sure this is all right for tagging isn't this so much easier than sewing it all so easy everything's perfect I'm gonna hit okay fantastic now let's go into our carryover look at that all in I didn't have to look for it it's just there how easy one I could then do this is what's gonna blow your line is now what I could just do is like edits so let's say I just want the pocket I know I'm gonna hit Plus I'm gonna hit enter okay and you see how this is automatically pain too so like this automatically adds the underscore one to it so like it always will automatically name it here's how it names it so it means that by taking the style name and the block name and then it creates that name for you so this is pullover sweater from body one this is a little over a sweater from Bobby see this is pull over switcher back body that's how it needs it and it will automatically do it for you but of course you can change it so some of the great new updates is you don't have to go into a mode you can just do it straight like you can use all of the amazing tools of sewing symmetry all of that that you know and love that we're just used to to create the Garment and then you just save it as a style when you're done and you then have it as a whole library that you can switch between whenever you feel like it and once you've defined each block like each pattern within the block you can then start to just play around and edit this again you can check your tie lines I'm pretty confident in them do you know this though and the timelines are wrong or so that means your sewing goes wrong which means you have to adjust it so you see how I'm just editing this around because I want to make multiple options to play through it's very simple to now do you can also use the saline any tools to do this really quickly and easily but no so here I'm going to hit enter free and I'm now going to check my the sewing tags so this is correct let's say this was a little bit off I can click on this and drag it so that it's longer or anything if I need to but if this was just like I don't know completely wrong I would have to resell but again as long as your sewing's correct this will be correct so just double check your sewing and it'll be great so really easy next one I can just do again I could use the style line tools so I can edit a style line or I could move or I could make like bigger or anything I could scale it let's move it okay obviously me making all of these changes means that this shouldn't be a top carryover style anymore but you can see like now I can make all of these changes and I could say this out as a new file and say like hey this is our new block for this season let's try it out but you can see that you can easily make iterations and have a whole Library fairly quickly so next is the new modular Library workflow too so as you saw in this one we use the same have like the same garment that we added in as the style and then we started to edit on top of it and make more iterations what you might be asking yourself is hey Phoebe but what if I have like 10 Styles already made and I just want to pop them all into the library don't worry I thought of you too okay what I can say is it's easy too so here I have already created this fit and flare style I already put in my first dress like the style has been defined and this is a new garment file okay I brought this in completely completely different how I would add this in is I could do file save as style we already did that but again I would just go to style and then I would go to women's and then it's already all in here and then I will just play through enough now I just checked my new sewing so uh amazing thank you now I have this other spelling that I had like already off in my world and I can switch between these two now let me add in any another dress so now I'm going to add in another dress no this is another nice thing you actually tell me don't have to save your file for it to save in your uh modular Library it will just automatically save in that module or library and it'll be there I test I've tested this out quite a few times and I'm really really cut it close uh but it's great because it automatically is saved in here so I didn't hit save or anything but these will stay here as you can see here's a completely new file again it has the same setups and everything it's the same kind of fit and style but let's say I wanted to add it while I was in my library and it's really simple too so instead of going to file save and style what I'm going to do is I'm just going to hit this plus button next to the front block it's going to take me automatically to that modular creator and the block section and I'm just going to select all of my effect again everything's going so well okay here's my next one again I can start to play around with the different sleeves I can go through all of it quickly switch it all up simulate you know and that is how easy it is to add other garments that you might have made in other project files or garment files just drop them in either hit this plus button or you can go to file save as style if the style like this has already been defined meaning that blocks have been attached to it tags up in Maine and you went back to your you know style line edit tool or you started editing this around with your scale style line tool because I don't know what to tell you but it's pretty amazing tool and it makes it so easy to design and edit in here but here let's say I just edited that really quick I could go to file save as block and again I'll go to my front skirt and then Define that because these are already defined so you all you have to do is just hit enter and say like oh this is I just want to add it in and it's like okay great no I'm done and I just wanted to add those and you can then scroll through right see all of that pretty great all right I know this has already been a long video they are with me because we've got two more things to go through now let's go into workflow option three wow you guys are like how are you still talking right now okay this is a great work to option this is when okay pretend you're in like an admin or something or a manager or whoever and you're super excited about the amazingness of modular library and the new modular and all of the things we can't wait to get your whole team started in us because you know it's revolutionary in the thing of the future okay but you want to set it up first so that everybody understands the rules and all of that this is how you could set something up from the beginning you don't actually need to style on anything you don't need any of that what you can just do is you can go from you can just add in so you can say from the very beginning you can say I just want to add add a word now you might be asking yourself if how do I organize this there are so many ways you can organize this however best it will work for you your company your brand your factory your meals it however you want to organize it you can organize it nature and I make this very open so that everybody is happy if you're not happy I guess add to the comments and tell me how we can improved you are happy answer the comments and tell me that you're happy I don't know you don't have to um um if you're unhappy definitely write in those comments okay so that we can understand them so here what I'm going to set it up is with like let's say Ad group so I'm going to just do new folder and I'm going to say um men men's ball 20. 26. holder great now you've added that in now I'm going to double click and have a category so now I'm going to set up a category again this is for the men's ball 2026 I'm going to say um shirt blocking okay and now this is created again another like session now I can create a style so I don't have anything in my workspace or anything that's okay I can just hit plus add Style and a placeholder image will be there you can always change this out to what it will be but now you can see in the style so you can say um basic you can say short sleeve can you say vlog thank you okay and then I can double click and I can then start to add in so I'm going to say open block presets and bring in the basis on and now I have this all set up so then a new user Let's Pretend me comes in and they say oh wow they realize oh I'm gonna have here's a file I have that I'm going to bring in here I have it great so I'm gonna go to film sure what I could do now is I could right click and change the thumbnail if I wanted to because I have the I'm the user and I'm like oh I want this but if I don't or I can just like not end the admin or whoever can add it in what I'll then do is hit add and then I'll go through exactly as you've gone through before from Bonnie enter okay Back Bonnie and turn okay here's something you should know there's grading applied to this here's something really magical about you're all really appreciate the grading will be safe so here the grading is all in here and I can check this okay let's wipe this all out I'll then bring in the shirt again and you see that this grading was all saved Within These blocks so if you have grading all set up already you can save that enough to I know you're all shocked and excited and happy I am too set up options for the modular Library I kind of touched on this a little bit when I was like oh this is your third and final third workflow option but setup options so here I have a bunch of different setup options to show you for modular we have just all the presets right the classic men women presets in which it's all style based so like there's a core style and then you have all of these options you can also do this though in a different way you could do like components so here I have the cloak component so that's my group here's categories I have bodies and here's a body now I have all these different body options that I can play with that all work as components I could then go back right to style category and I could do sleeves and I can play around with all the different sleeve types so you can save it out as more oh these are all the sleeves these are all the uh body these are all of our collars and you can save it out like that you can say then dress leaves if you also are doing more of a carryover so you have like carryover Styles tops all of that and let's say women's graphic tees so here I have like all these women with graphic tees what I did here is I actually made sure that there were placements for the graphics to then be placed on specifically for each block that I was adding in but also if you did carryover and fashion so let's say that I had spring women shirts again this would be a great option for the group like women's fashion for That season then you could do categories right so I did fashion blocks for 20 25 then I did categories spring women's shirts and now I have all the bodies for spring women's shirts that I can play around with and it like edit and adjust I have all the sleeves so I have like my own little sleeve block library that I could play around with and adjust I have different colors that I could play around with I have hems and you can then build out a library like that so that you almost how we all have that like sketch library and uh illustrator we could do that here where you are just like oh here's like a posse that we always use and it looks like this let's just drop it in here's uh Rylan C it's okay that this is set in we'll just drop this in and we'll start to sketch and draw and like say this is different oh this is how we have our callers but this doesn't exactly fit the body but it's fine right so you can start to really play around with these different options and everything I even added in pleats so like see with this like fashion I have a fleece front with this kind of sleeve no not everything works perfectly but it's fine because it will right and it's looking good so you can like play around with all of this stuff and edit and adjust it you can really set this up however you it works best if you are going to do a component just remember that the whole style has to be defined so what I mean by that is if I bring in this button down I cannot just pop in these sweeps or if you're going to do components and everything know this okay you have stuck around this long so pay attention for the component stop it like let's say I have this button down right I brought this in the sleeves and everything and I want to add this these sleeves into this spring women's like fashion right I can't just go into sleeves Plus add in and like add any sleep okay if I do I'll hit enter and I'll have a sleeves and you'll see once the tagline thing pops up that there's nowhere for this to be so like there's no tabs so okay then hit it okay and I just delete this I'm bringing these sleeves you'll see that there isn't any sewing okay if I switch to these leaves they're sorry so sleeve sleeves there's no sewing so if I simulate nothing will connect okay what do you do then right great question so let's bring the button down back in here it is free everything's awesome everything's fantastic I'm gonna delete what I do is what you need to do is you need to Define this whole style so you need to Define because you need Chloe needs to understand right now this style is just like a style it does not know how these are all connected even if you said sleeve Block it's like okay sleeve block tone what like you don't have a body block so the sleeve block too so like there's no connections that's how the thought is thinking so what you have to do is you have to then say like this is the connection here's the body this is how the sleeve and then it's connected to the body so what I do is category and what I'll do is I'll hit add category and I'll say full styles this is my workaround sometimes so I'll say full Styles and then I'll say my account button down on it okay and I'll then create the block section so front and gone okay then on the plus and I'll do the front and now Khloe understands okay so this like this is how the sleeve connects fantastic what you will then do is you'll go back to your category and I can now add in these leaves because now glow now like this pattern and everything is defined it knows it knows that the sleeves are near it knows how it's sewn together and there will be tagging so now there's going to be tagging because it now understands like even this is part of it and I'll say okay and it won't even work for this body this and you see now how there's sewing it will even work with us and everything and it will even work for I believe the color so you can see that even you just need everything to be just find and then it will all work out and that's just the only thing that needs to happen so that is all thank you all so much for staying with me going through all of it if you needed to jump around don't worry I completely understand uh this was a long video but I hope you know a lot more about modular you understand it a little bit more and you are playing around with it so much and using it it's like really gonna be so beneficial to all of your workflows and just improving your lives I think a lot if you have any questions please please please use those comment sections below we do monitor them and we're constantly trying to answer them and help you out better if you have any thoughts about how this can be improved can't wait to hear it and really looking forward to all of the comments and thoughts here thank you so much again don't forget to like And subscribe because there's so many great videos as I talked about earlier and there's just a ton of ways to help you out here but thank you again and have a great day   ",
        "Summary": "## Comprehensive Guide to the Modular Library and Creator ### Introduction In this guide, we will provide a step-by-step overview of the new Modular Library and Configurator, along with the Modular Creator. This will include comparisons with the old version, detailed instructions on setting up your libraries, saving styles, and tips for effective use. --- ### Part 1: Understanding the Old Modular Mode #### 1. Overview of Old Modular Mode - **Modular Mode Activation**: You start by entering Modular Mode. - **Template Presets**: Select a template preset (e.g., basic T-shirt). - **Pattern Pieces**: Drag and drop pattern pieces into modular blocks. - **Sewing Process**: After arranging the pattern pieces, you must sew all components together manually, as symmetry does not apply. #### 2. Key Steps in Old Version - **Setup**: - Enter Modular Mode. - Choose a template and pattern pieces. - Drag and drop pattern pieces into blocks. - **Sewing**: - Manually sew each component (sleeves, body). - Resew components to connect them to the launcher. - **Saving**: - Save the created garment in the Modular Library. - Take snapshots of each style for reference. #### 3. Challenges - **Manual Work**: The old version required extensive manual sewing and adjustments. - **Complexity**: The absence of symmetry meant more work for users, leading to frustration. --- ### Part 2: New Modular Creator Workflow #### 1. Introduction to the New Modular Creator - The new workflow simplifies the process significantly, allowing users to save styles easily and make edits without going through lengthy setups. #### 2. Setting Up a New Style - **Step 1**: Start with your garment (e.g., a sweatshirt). - **Step 2**: Go to ‚ÄúFile‚Äù > ‚ÄúSave As Style‚Äù to access the Modular Creator. #### 3. Organizing Your Styles - **Group, Category, and Style**: - Create groups (e.g., seasons, collections). - Define categories (e.g., tops, bottoms). - Add styles under those categories. #### 4. Importing Blocks - Use preset block templates to quickly load your designs: - Go to ‚ÄúFile‚Äù > ‚ÄúOpen Block Presets‚Äù to import existing designs. #### 5. Editing Styles - You can easily edit styles by entering the Modular Creator and making changes directly to blocks and components. --- ### Part 3: Advanced Features #### 1. Creating Thumbnail Images - Use the schematic render function to create a sketch-like thumbnail for your styles. - Adjust color and brightness to match your design aesthetics. #### 2. Simplifying Design Iterations - You can duplicate existing styles and make quick edits to create variations. - Changes made to a style are automatically saved, allowing for rapid prototyping. #### 3. Organizing Multiple Styles - To add multiple styles to your library: - Use the plus button next to the front block to add new garments. - Import existing styles without needing to save each file individually. --- ### Part 4: Setting Up Your Modular Library #### 1. Creating a Library Structure - **Administrator Setup**: For managers setting up a library for a team: - Create folders for different seasons or collections. - Organize categories within those folders (e.g., shirts, dresses). #### 2. Adding New Components - You can add new components and save grading directly within the blocks, ensuring consistency across designs. #### 3. Understanding Components - When using components, ensure that all parts are properly defined and connected to avoid errors during simulation. --- ### Tips and Tricks 1. **Snapshot Before Saving**: Always take a snapshot of your design before saving it to ensure you have a reference. 2. **Use Grouping**: Organize your styles into logical groups and categories for easy navigation. 3. **Leverage Automation**: Use the automation features for naming and creating thumbnails to save time. 4. **Test Regularly**: Regularly test your designs in the 3D space to ensure they appear as expected. 5. **Seek Feedback**: Share your designs with team members for feedback and improvement opportunities. --- ### Conclusion The new Modular Library and Creator streamline the design process, making it easier to create, edit, and save styles. By following this comprehensive guide, you will be able to navigate the new features effectively, enhancing your design workflow and creativity. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to leave comments. Happy designing!"

        "publishedAt": "2023-07-26T04:00:07Z",
        "Transcript": "  key feature for close 7.2 is enhanced modular capabilities and workflow so as you can see here I have the new modular Library window open I'm going to go through how we can easily create and add in new style blocks within it so as you see here we've got a dress style like any ordinary project and to create a new modular block from this we just need to go to file save as Style now when you select that this new modular Creator will come up so you can decide to use any of the groups that you see here or you can use the plus icon to bring in your own group this will then browse your computer finder where you can select the folder to bring in and once you do have it there simply select it and then we can move on to the rest beginning with category So within category you can organize this however you want you could bring together shirts dresses pants outerwear or you can organize it more creatively with categories like fit and flare that you see here in my modular Creator but now I'll create a brand new category and I'll call it webinar for today's demonstration then just select OK and once you've got the category you want simply double click and move on to style so for style I'm going to be creating the dress that you see here and when you first select add it's going to automatically generate a thumbnail you can give it a name and you can also use your own thumbnail that you've created I'll do that now and use a schematic render and select ok so now I have my dress I've named it now I just need to select double click and move on to adding the blocks so once we get to block you've got the option to open presets you can save and press the plus icon to add new blocks which I'll do now let's see what that's all about so to create a new block you'll find type and a drop down list so what you want to do is simply scroll through and find the block that most closely matches your pattern and in the tag below you are able to rename it if you want to and then just select OK and continue to go through and add as many blocks as you need for your style and if you do make a mistake you can just press delete so we've got all of the blocks ready for the style now let's go ahead and start creating so the OK button is grayed out you need to select the block that you would like to create first your pattern is then going to be outlined and you need to select all patterns that belong to that particular block so for for my particular pattern that's including those three pattern pieces together and here I can rename it it'll automatically generate a thumbnail image and you can use your own as well so then you simply need to go through the process of selecting a block identifying it by selecting it in the three in the 2D window pressing enter to confirm it and then you'll notice those ticks coming along the side of each block as it has been successfully added   have gone through and created all of the blocks you will now be able to select ok and when you do you'll get this warning to check your sewing tag lines note that if you need to make a lot of corrections to your sewing you will need to cancel and go back to the beginning and modify your sewing but otherwise you just want to go through check all of your sewing connections are correct and when you're satisfied press ok so if we now take a look in the new modular Library here is the dress and all of the pattern blocks we just created so what now what I can do now that I've got all of this block set up is I can modify the pattern that I have here and create a brand new block so I'm going to use my style line tools to add a little bit of length here perhaps just a little bit of Swing just to demonstrate and then simulate those changes I have a new skirt style and I can save this out as a new block press the plus icon and then again select the relevant pattern okay and then always of course checking the sewing tags all looks good and just repeat again pressing the plus icon to add the back skirt that looks good and once again checking the sewing tags so now we have a brand new front and back skirt block but what if you want to create a lot of blocks together again from a brand new style you can easily do that as well so let's bring in a totally new garment it is a compatible pattern with the dress style one that we have been working with   of styles that all fit together with dress style one all I need to do to add these to my block library is press the plus icon and then I'll be prompted to go through and select each of the relevant blocks just like before pressing enter once you've made your selection and updating the thumbnail if you would like to do that updating the name tag if you would like to do that as you can see I'm just going to go through and confirm it as it is selecting each block in turn finally the front and the back skirts and okay and will now be prompted to of course check our sewing and as I mentioned before if your sewing is correct incorrect you will need to go back to the beginning check your sewing as usual but mine looks good so now we have all of those blocks have now been added to dress style one and I can bring them into the workspace mix and match things just by double clicking them as you saw before you can continue to modify the style add it to your block library but as you can see if you mix and match pieces of different lengths like this skirt your result is not going to be beautiful so be mindful your pattern blocks do need to be compatible but it's really easy and intuitive to use the new modular Creator so hopefully this adds a lot of benefit to your workflow thank you I'm very excited to share with you that soft body is one of our key features for 7.2 so as you know in previous versions The Avatar retained its original shape even around tightening points like elastic waistbands but now instead of 0.2 you can express more realism when the body is being compressed by garments with shrinkage such as waistbands underwear and swimwear so let's take a look at this feature and I'll explain what it is and how you can use it first the soft body feature only responds when the Avatar is wearing a garment that would ordinarily affect its body shape like this swimwear outfit with elastic I have here and it's just like fabric simulation it's also going to be affected by gravity which is pretty cool and one thing to note that is only currently available for our adult avatars so let's dive in and take a look at this feature what it is and how you can use it so first just select your avatar and now in its surface properties you'll find the option to toggle on soft body simulation and when you toggle this on you'll now have this soft body stiffness settings sliding bar so the default is seven thousand and this stiffness value allows you to adjust the responsiveness of the body to pressure with lower values allowing the body to be more easily affected by pressure and larger values allowing the body to be less affected by pressure it also responds differently in different areas of the body just like the human form so the bust abdomen and thighs are more responsive and more soft whereas areas like the shoulders are going to be less affected by pressure and allow you to express things like elastic realistically to the human form as I mentioned the default stiffness is 7000 the max is 10 000 and the minimum is five thousand so please feel free to play around with those ranges but let's take a look at how this responds with our fit maps on when you first simulate you will see that the soft body mesh is being calculated and note this could take longer for larger body types or more complex garments but once the the calculation is complete we'll be able to see how the body and clothing both respond to each other and to gravity as well so here we can see that the area around the waist is responding now to the waistband and we can see the difference in our strain map for our waistband as well so the Garment is responding in turn note that at the moment it is difficult to accurately accurately assess the fit using this feature so we do recommend that it's used to create more realistic body expression for purposes like content making different stiffness values and how that affects affect Avatar and the garments responsiveness so bringing this down to a minimum of five thousand I'll simulate and we can see the body is now responding with more softness around that waist area if I bring it up to a maximum of 10 000 re-simulate we see a rebound and the body is now more stiff around that waistband area now do note you've got a little icon down the bottom here just to give you an indication that the soft body feature has been enabled and yes you can use it on more than one Avatar now if you do want to go back to the original Avatar with the rigid body you can toggle this off and you can see the Avatar returns to its original shape just note that you will need to re-simulate the Garment to allow it to redrape to the new revised body form a couple of notes if you do open the Avatar editor window when the soft body is applied you will see this warning that simulation will soft body simulation will be turned off this is because to resize the Avatar the soft body calculation needs to be redone so it's recommended that you resize your avatar and then apply the soft body simulation now a couple of more things to note on soft body if you do have it enabled you'll not be able to use it in recording your animations at the moment if you do attempt to simulate or to record an animation you'll receive this warning message which lets you know it's only available in simulation mode but this is a feature that will be available in future releases so that you can use it in animation mode as well and when we are in simulation mode at the moment it's also not available for GPU simulation only for fitting accurate fabric as well as normal simulation of modes so if you do attempt to use the GPU just like in animation mode you'll receive the supporting message and again this is something that will be included in future releases now here's a feature I know a lot of you are going to be really excited about from 7.2 we now have camera animation so let's jump into animation mode and see what this feature is all about so before I begin you can use camera animation even if your avatar doesn't have any motion applied or there's no garment animation but today I am using a pre-recorded motion file to create a bit more of a dynamic video for the webinar and you can see the recorded information down here as the red bars in the timeline now before we dive in it is useful to briefly talk about keyframes which are important to how to work with this feature so as you might already know animations are made by merging together lots of still frames to create a video so if you have specific information you want to show on a particular frame like the camera position we call it a keyframe and you can see that I have 192 frames here and that is also indicated by the blue bar Down Below in my timeline and one last little thing to point out before I kick off is these brand new icons here which allow you to animate the camera and I'll be going over what these Dot and how you can use them so there's a couple of ways that we can work with camera animation and the first is to use the 3D viewer to frame the camera and add keyframes so first of all bring your playhead to around the area you want it and then you can type directly into the timeline toolbar as well to set your keyframes now use the 3D viewer to navigate to the camera view you would like and then in the toolbar using the icon here to your left add replace camera keyframes click it once and notice that we now have an item in our timeline for camera and we have this green keyframe indicating we've just animated our camera pretty easy right so now I'll just go ahead and create some more keyframes just so you get a good idea of how this works moving the playhead adjusting my 3D viewer and then pressing the little icon to add my keyframes if I press play we can see my camera has been animated so that's method one the second way that you can work with camera animation is to move the camera yourself so to do that you click this icon for camera viewfinder then we get the camera preview and if you zoom out we now can see the camera in our 3D viewer so the camera preview does as the name suggests and it is showing us a preview of what the camera is looking at and if we navigate around in the 3D window notice that it's no longer setting the camera view but we do have this green line indicating where the camera is pointing and this blue dot which we'll call the aim point and you can think of this as the focus of the camera which right now is pointing at the Avatar's waist now some of you might already be wondering how can you set the aspect ratio for your camera notice that the preview here has an a portrait aspect ratio so this is linked to the render window and the image settings there of course that's where we would render out the final product so you can move this preview window wherever you like so I'll move that over there and come into the render window and directly into the image settings notice as you change the size it immediately updates your camera preview so you can set your aspect ratio to whatever you would like and then once you finish just close that off and you can also resize and as you saw reposition the camera preview wherever you would like it now let's talk about how you can adjust that aim point I mentioned earlier or that little blue dot so we already have some keyframes set up and I'm still in a camera viewfinder which means I can manipulate the camera directly to change the keyframe so click on it once and you will receive the Gizmo and make the adjustments and notice that as I change it it is still pointing directly at the avatar so if I move the playhead a little up make a new adjustment with my camera it will automatically create that keyframe down below and if you would like to adjust where it's aiming you can do that as well just click on that blue dot again you get the handy Gizmo and you can adjust where the camera is focused really easy right now you can also move your camera position and aim Point together click the camera and notice this little icon here click it once and it's going to group them so now I have a gizmo that will move the aim point and the camera position together so far so good all right let's now look at the property editor and explain a little bit about our camera properties so the first item you can see here is frame and it's showing us our current frame we have a keyframe for our camera and it's the current position of our playhead now you can move the camera keyframe by typing in any value here so if I change this from 111 to say 130 notice that that has repositioned the keyframe now you can also adjust your camera's position with the sliders here so if you want to make some more fine adjustments you can come into your Properties or you can use the Gizmo and you can do the same thing again with the camera aim and notice that your camera preview all the while is showing you the view results so however you're comfortable you can adjust your camera position and aim here in the properties or with the Gizmo now one final icon I need to show you is our camera pass so when we turn the visibility on we now see this blue line in our 3D viewer and this is the path our camera is taking based on those keyframes that we set up and we can see each of those keyframes because they're indicated by the little blue points here along the camera's path now you can also see how your camera is traveling by clicking on the keyframes it's going to snap to those little blue dots and if you just scrub through the timeline it's going to show how the camera is traveling between those keyframes so two more things to point out in the camera property editor first of all is this item called straight track so going to a keyframe toggling this on this will now show you that you have taken a straight path between these two keyframes rather than a curved path then you can see here in the camera preview if I come back and toggle that off to compare we can see the different results so this enables you to take a direct straight path rather than a natural curve and you'll always know that this is the case because this icon here will be a square rather than a circle and then we have keep continuity so toggling this off notice that I now have no path between these two keyframes and it's also there displayed in the 3D viewer and so by toggling this off you're able to create a camera effects like job Cuts as you can see okay so now let's talk about editing our keyframes few ways to do it first of all you want to have your keyframe selected and then you can update it here in the properties or if you've got the camera viewfinder on you can work directly by moving the camera in the 3D viewer if you have camera viewfinder off again just make sure that you have your keyframe selected and then you can use the add replace to update your keyframe and those changes will be reflected immediately to move a keyframe we can do that up in the property editors which we saw before but you can also click and drag your keyframe to reposition it directly in the timeline as well to delete a keyframe simply right click it directly in the timeline and delete camera keyframe and if you need to delete all of your keyframes perhaps you want to start from scratch you can do that by right clicking next to camera in the timeline and if you select delete it's going to delete all of the animated keyframes so that's it for how to use the feature now let's talk about saving so if you've got camera animation data in your project it's going to save out with your Z project file together with your avatar garment and other motion files but we also have a new file type which is going to allow you to save and reuse your keyframe animated camera data in other projects so go to file and save as and you'll find camera motion is a new item here and you can just save it out on your desktop or in your closed Library I'll just save this as camera and then you can open as camera motion and apply it to any project file and we have also given you some presets that you can start working with straight away so you're going to find some brand new subfolders in your avatars in the closed library and you'll have a new folder called camera motion you'll find that for both of our adult avatars and notice that the names for these camera motions are a match for our Avatar motions so you can bring in the related Avatar motion and then the camera motion to match so to apply this it's the same as applying a motion you would just double click it to apply it to Avatar and to apply the camera again just double click it in the library and notice it's going to bring it into my project and I can start using it straight away so while you're working out how to how to create your own custom camera animation you can start working with these presets straight away and last but not least let's talk about how you can output your finished animations so just like before you have the option to take a quick capture by going to file video capture and selecting animation and that's just going to give you the basic shaded view that we see in our 3D viewer here you can set your aspect ratio press record to record it and then you can save it out as an mp4 or an Avi and of course for those really high quality presentations you're going to want to render it out by the render window setting up your lighting environment and your quality settings how you want them and of course using animation as your output type so that is a wrap on camera animation a fantastic new feature and I know you're going to have a lot of fun playing with this one from close 7.2 you can now Express elastic more realistically and you'll find brand new elastics in your fabric library in a new subfolder called elastic we have knit and woven presets for you to use so I'll go ahead and create myself a trim subfolder in my fabric object browser and then I'll bring in this knit I'll just drag and drop in this elastic and we'll apply it to a pattern the same as a fabric I'm just going to drag and drop it onto my pattern piece if I zoom in here you can see that gorgeous realistic structure of the elastic now I'll go ahead and add the woven elastic to the object browser as well this time drag and drop it onto my waistband and of course you are able to customize your elastic according to the design so for example let's go ahead and change the color of the elastic and apply that right now but we can also adjust the stiffness and strength of the elastic so with my simulation and my FIT maps on if I go into the elastic property editor and play with these settings you can see where it's becoming more or less tight indicated by those red areas on my FIT map now let's go and apply these to our bra straps as well I'm just going to select those particular pattern pieces and then assign them over in my object browser now something that I want to point out here is that the grain line of your elastic pattern must be perpendicular to the length of the elastic or along the weft grain as you see here so let's go ahead and update the Grain Lines for those pattern pieces now that looks right I will go ahead and update the color for my knit elastic as well so it matches my waistband perfect now we can also apply elastic to stabilize a seam with binding so using my binding tool I'll just go ahead and apply this binding along the length of that leg opening simulate to take effect to it and once it is simulated over in my property editor I'll have the option to apply the elastic that's up there in my object browser already here's my drop down list I'll select the woven elastic and again I'll be mindful to update my grain to a weft grain I'll simulate this once more and that looks perfect and of course don't forget to refine your garment as always so just to polish this one off I'm going to select my patterns change my particle distance down to a high resolution five then I'll simulate it once more and zoom on in here a little bit we can see how that garment fits and realism Has Come Together really nicely perfect now let's look at some other applications so when I simulate in this file the shorts fall down because my pattern is larger than my waist measure so let's go ahead and apply some elastic first I'll take her waist measure and then in the 2D window I'll create a pattern according to that measurement of course you can create your own pattern according to the elastic width and height that you need now go ahead and unfold the pattern along the center so that I have a complete pattern piece and as I mentioned before just be mindful of the grain Direction I'm going to check it with my texture editing tool just to make sure that it's perpendicular to the length of my elastic which is great I can move on and arrange it on our Avatar and I'll use Arrangement points to do this and Nest it underneath my main waistband nice and cozy in there so now the pattern is arranged let's go ahead and put it together and sew it all up I'll do that in the 2D window nice and easy and of course make sure I sew the sides together and then it's ready to simulate and even though we haven't applied the elastic yet we do get an elastic effect from that smaller pattern piece so my shorts are staying firmly in place but let's go ahead and add the elastic which of course I can find in my fabric folder if I just bring it into my objects browser and then I can apply it to my selected pattern piece I'll just drag and drop it down now when I simulate the shorts will fit a lot more realistically and don't forget to refine the Gathering details by selecting all of your patterns and decreasing the particle distance down to five which of course is going to give you more definition and realism for your elastic expression beautiful now if I hide the Avatar we can see there's the elastics are being applied to the inside of the waistband but we can also apply shearing along the pattern edges to refine this elastic expression even more so I'll go ahead and select all of those edges toggle it on simulate to take effect to those changes and hide the Avatar and let's have a closer look at that expression it's looking really great now we could stop here but let's go ahead and turn this into a concealed waistband type I'm just going to create a layer clone underneath and then go ahead and use sub layers in order to arrange all of this so I can do that with my sub layering tool I'll just connect all of these together simulate to take effect to it and it will be arranged into the correct order perfect now I'll just hide the Avatar and have a closer look at the inside of the waistband again with my thin textured view we can see the front face of the fabric is flipped inwards so I'm going to flip normal to update that but if I simulate now my beautiful arrangement is coming undone so to address this first I'll undo and then go ahead and use the sub layer option to update my sub layer from a plus to a minus and then when I simulate again everything's going to be arranged correctly so just don't forget that step for concealed waistbands now I'll hide the top pattern so we can have a look there's my elastic band sitting perfectly inside Everything Has Come Together exactly as it should beautiful now let's apply some elastic to other areas of this outfit I'm going to use the binding tool to apply elastic along the tops hem edge here to give it a nice cinched in puff top finish and once that's applied of course you can set the desired width I'm going to use 20 millimeters here and then you can update your fabric type from fabric to elastic and I'd like to use the knit elastic type so I need to First bring this into the object browser now that's available here in my drop down and of course I must update my grain to a weft direction for elastic now if I briefly hide the Avatar we can see that's nested perfectly and looks very much like an elastic finish but we're not complete with the design so next I want that cinched in Waist so I'm going to update the length of the elastic so at the moment I'm going to take the underbust measure as a guide and I can update the links over here now I just need to simulate to take effect to that let it re-drape and we're getting that cinch in look and it's already starting to look pretty good but of course we can get much more realistic expression once we reduce the particle distance of the patterns so if I select the elastic we can see that it is already at a low particle distance so I just need to update my main front pattern from 20 to 5 so I can get a look at the realistic fabric drape and that's starting to look really great but just like before if we want to even further Express this we can add shearing along the padded edges so I'll select those toggle it on simulate again to take effect to it and that looks really fantastic now one last little detail I'll update the color here I've got the color books but I'm going to use a bit of a color selector and then pull out a color with my Color Picker that looks great okay one more application for elastic in this outfit let's apply some to the sleeve here so first of all I'm going to extend my pattern Edge and I'll extend it by 20 millimeters making sure to check on create internal line and mirror now let's also offset the pattern outline as an internal line as well one more little step let's quickly update the sewing as well and briefly simulate to take effect to all of this and just like last time we'll be using our binding tool to apply binding to the pattern edge here now you can decide on the width of your binding depending on the width of the elastic that you need and of course change the fabric type to elastic and make sure to update your grain direction to weft for all of your elastic applications so now that's settled in there I can see it's underneath now I'm going to fold my pattern up because I need this to be a turned hem type I'll reduce the fold angle so it's nice and sharp sew this down make sure my sewing tape is turned and reset the arrangement just to Nest it back inside now we can simulate to take effect to that change and then it's starting to look okay but we do need to now change the length of our elastic so I will do that now and bring it down to 250 mils for my design here simulate let it all settle down and once that's done just like earlier the final steps to refine the pattern are to reduce its particle distance bring it down to a high resolution five and if you want even more Gathering effect of course then we can next add some shearing as well so now that's settled down I'll select the pattern edges toggle on my shearing and it's starting to look good but if you're seeing any little Collision issues and I have just a little bit here you are able to just to give it a gentle pull help it all come together neatly and it's starting to settle down nicely so let's zoom on out and have a look at our completed outfit with all of the elastic detailing beautiful   7.2 it is possible to unfold multiple patterns at the same time so before this update it was necessary to select and unfold each pen individually now you can just simply select the lines that you wish to unfold while holding shift and after that you can right click and find your unfold options turning this task into something a lot more efficient another Improvement is the new option to unfold the pattern without the internal lines so in this particular style I have a patch placed on one side of the dress if I unfold this using the unfold or unfold symmetric options the internal line of that patch will be replicated to the other side of the dress as well there is a new Option named unfold pattern I outline only and this will allow you to unfold your pattern without the internal lines this is really useful in cases like this where you have patches pockets and other details that will only exist on one side of the pattern just be mindful that this option doesn't keep the symmetric linked editing for your pattern we've also made improvements to our clone as reference line feature so as you can see here I have a pattern so to clone this pattern Edge as a reference line I select it then I right click and I can find that option to clone as a reference line now this is going to enable me to still see the original pattern Edge when I make changes to my pattern so if I extend the Hem edge here enter a value here is my original hem Edge indicated by this reference line now one of the improvements that we've made is that you're now able to trace this out as an internal line using the trace tool simply select it and hit enter or right click to find that option now you're also able to use that original reference line to trace to go back a step and replace as pattern outline making the editing workflow a lot more efficient and if you do want to go back to that extension it's simply a matter of tracing out that reference line and selecting those edges and again replacing as a pattern outline we've also improved the cloners reference line so now that when you cut a pattern the reference line will be included within all of those patterns so now if I divide this pattern first by creating an internal line and then I'll cut and sew now if I move these patterns apart you can see that the reference line has been cloned across both making it easier to go back to previous edits or just keep track of your changes another update is to our tracing tool and the ability to now Trace out the half symmetric fold line so I'm creating a pocket shape here with the internal line tool and I'm now able to select the symmetric fold line as part of my shape and it more easily Trace that out as a pattern so now I'll just select the center and unfold and I now have a complete pattern piece so tracing out details along the symmetric fold Line is now possible and a lot more easier hopefully adding more efficiency to your workflow now in 7.2 the pattern name Position will change parallel to the grain line This Improvement makes it easier to view within the 2D window even if your grain line view is toggled off you can still know the direction of your green line by the pattern name position by clicking the edit texture tool we can rotate the grain line and you'll see that the pattern name follows the same position also the position adjustment happens if we change the grain grain line Direction within the property editor directly and you can edit the grain line value as you see the pattern name always stays in line with the grain line in 7.2 when you optimize your curve points you will now have more control over the adjustment so in previous versions the optimal number of points was set automatically and because it was automatic if you didn't get the desired result you would need to make manual adjustments to each of those curve points which could be time consuming so from version 7.2 well you can still use the automatic adjustment and find the optimal number of points while maintaining as much of that original line shape as possible you can now also have much more fine control over that adjustment which we hope makes your work more efficient to show you how this works I'll grab the curve Point editing tool and as you can see in this pattern there are many curve points so let's see how this Improvement can help to reduce them so if you want to adjust the number of points in the same proportion across all of your pattern pieces with the transform pattern tool right click into the background and select optimize curve points when this option is first opened you'll see the optimal ratio that's automatically set while it maintains the original line shape as much as possible now if you want to change this you can manually adjust the points by moving this bar and you'll see the 2D window is displaying the result so you can check it before you confirm now that looks good I'll press ok now if you just want to reduce the curve points for only one pattern you can do that by using the transform pattern tool right click on the pattern you would like to adjust and find the option to optimize curve points we'll get that same pop-up window and you can see in the preview in my 2D window only that pattern will be adjusted so you can use the slider to make the adjustment according to what you need and then just press ok to confirm it now what if you would just like to reduce the curve points for one particular area of the pattern like perhaps longer neckline or along the armhole here you can also do that just use your edit pattern tool right click on the segment that you would like to adjust and you'll find optimize curve points we'll get that same pop-up window and the 2D window preview is showing that it's only making adjustments to that segment so make the adjustments that you need and when you're happy then you can press reset if you would like to go back to the beginning and you also have the option to confirm it or cancel   from version 7.2 we've now also added the option to set your Notch position of your graded patterns to a fixed position so you can see what that means as I toggle through each of these sizes note that the notch position is fixed and we hope this will allow you to create more accurate patterns for production so let's see how this works first I'll bring in a DFX pattern and you'll see I now have Notch position options displayed so fixed will place all of The Notches in the same position across each graded size according to the starting point of that line and ratio is the same as the placement you're used to seeing in 7.1 where all group notches are graded proportionally if I select 5 fixed Notch as my option to demonstrate and select ok to confirm let's take a look at the pattern so over here in my grading tab we can see that I have three sizes and if I zoom in on the armhole here and toggle through each size you'll note that the notch position is fixed at 100 mils from the underarm across all of those grades now if I take a look at other areas of the pattern we can see the same is true each of those notches is being in a remains in a fixed position across all of those grades but I can already hear you asking yes it is also possible to set each Notch individually so now we're looking at the pattern with all Notch positions set to ratio so to fix Notch grading for specific notches grab your notching tool and now in this example a fixed Notch is going to be required to maintain the Gathering at the sleeve head notice that with the ratio grading if I move through these sizes the underarm notches no longer match which is going to bring that excess into the underarm which we don't want so to change this first of all just click on your notch and here in the properties editor you'll find the option to toggle on fixed and now to compare when I toggle through the graded sizing with my notch in it set to a fixed position we can see that it doesn't move between those graded sizes so we have a couple of new grading features that are available in print layout mode so let's go there and I'll explain so the first update is that in the property editor along with the fabric roll width we can also Now set the marker length so I have a number of grades for this style so I'll go ahead and set the number of each grades that I would like to Nest I'll set the grain Direction and Define the roll width just like before but notice here I'm now also able to set the marker length so in production the fabric roll needs to match the marker for accuracy so to improve this you're you're not able to Nest your patterns within a specified marker length so now when I begin to Nest cloak we'll calculate the consumption and create a market according to the length that I have defined and when the number of patterns exceeds the roll length then additional markers will be created and that will happen automatically as you can see here now if I zoom on in on the market detail text which runs along the top it's giving information about the width length and the consumption or both of the markers that have been generated the second Improvement is the ability to randomize your graded sizing you can turn on that display up in the 2D toggle menu as you can see here and you can also turn on the sizing text display making it just a lot easier to navigate and easily differentiate your sizes in your print layout marker another grading update for 7.2 is the ability to copy and paste the grade rules for X and Y individually so to do that simply right click and copy the grade rule find the point that you want to apply it to right click and under paste you can now paste both values or X and Y individually so if I now select X that grade rule will apply along the x-axis only and it works exactly the same if you want to do so along the y-axis so I'll copy right click and find paste and select the y-axis now this Improvement does also allow you to copy and mirror paste for your X and Y grade values individually so I'll follow the same process I'll first copy the grade Rule and this time I will find the point and mirror paste and here you can see the options to paste together or on individual axis so now I will select the X and you can see that rule has applied and over here the same again copy the rule and then find mirror paste this time I'll paste it on the y-axis and one final grading Improvement you'll now be able to see your X and Y measurements for your graded nest in the 2D window as well as in the property editor so in version 7.2 you'll also find we've improved the UI for the Avatar Editor to make it easier to create more naturally proportioned avatars some of you may have experienced moments of Doubt when entering measurements into the Avatar editor wondering if you're going about it in the right way especially when you're seeing a body shape that isn't smooth or natural so we've improved the Avatar editor UI to make it more intuitive and easier for you to adjust body shapes so firstly when we open up the Avatar editor you'll notice that check boxes have been added to the right for some categories these are measures that have the most impact on body shaping and proportion so if any of these are missing or incorrect you may not get the body shape that you want and you might see some deformed shapes so to make this a lot easier for you to create natural body shapes in your desired size we've added the function to let glow automatically calculate these values and proportionally edit by unchecking these boxes and I'll explain this as we go through and try out the improved interface so firstly in the total body category which we see at the top of our Avatar editor you'll see a new item called proportion at the moment it's grayed out and I have a check box over here it'll be off by default when you first open the Avatar editor and in order to use it you simply need to toggle it on so let's do that now and see what this is all about so now the option is available for me to edit and if I have a look at this drop down option at the moment it's set to inseam but you can also use CF neck to waste proportional editing now these are measures that are available down below however as they're the most important to proportional body editing it's more intuitive to create these measures first so we've put them in the total body category now if you want some more information about these measurements notice that there is an eye icon here next to proportion and when you hover over this it will give you more information about the inseam and CF net to waste Dimensions as well as the information we just discussed so if you do know your exact measure for your inseam or for your CF neck to waist you can now enable proportion to enter those values here in total body and just note that when you do it will be disabled below so if I select cfnet to waste notice here the option below is grayed out because we've defined the value here and demonstrate again the same applies for the inseam so I'll go ahead now and give my inseam a random value let's go with 86. so what do you do if you don't know the value of one of these proportional measures you can simply disable it and as you can see it will now ignore the previously entered value and automatically create appropriate inseam and safe next to waste values based on what I've entered for my height to demonstrate let's increase the total height for our Avatar and we can see that those values for my insane and my CF neck waste below are being edited proportional to the height of my avatar so after entering the values for total body you will need to select a type in the details category to add the remaining measures for your avatar we recommend selecting the basic type and filling in those fields first and then selecting an advanced human body or dress form type if you need additional fields we'll explain the last type simple later but for now notice that only the basic type has the proportional checkbox added so let's jump back into basic editing type and start adding in some of the missing measures so here are my proportional editing check boxes but first I'm going to start by entering my circumference measures so moving through one at a time just neck bicep waste High hip and finally low hip now over here in my CF neck to waist if I know the exact value I'm able to input that information directly if I don't have an exact measure you can simply uncheck this and Khloe will then calculate this measure based on the information you've already added so notice that this has now been adjusted according to the circumference measures so if I now start entering some values above notice that my CF net to waist measure is automatically being real recalculated and the reason this is happening is the cloak Avatar is based on real human body scan data so it creates national natural proportions based on the values of each of these items so even if you don't know the specific measures that are most important to the overall body shape these items here with the check boxes you can still create a natural body shape so if you are experiencing issues when entering your avatar size perhaps you don't have the precise values for some of these checkbox items or you've been in entering the incorrect measurements we recommend that you turn off the check boxes and use proportional editing so I'll now turn these ones off and enter my total rise allowing the the neck to waist measure to be automatically calculated now let's have a look at that simple type in the newly added details category so from the drop down details list I'll go into simple and it is simpler than basic because you can enter values for only a few items so that means even if you don't know all of the measures for the items in basic you can still create an avatar with a natural body shape and minimal data also when you select the simple details type notice the total body shape is enabled which is one of the improvements we've made from the previous version and it was originally only enabled when the width was set to wait in total body so in this version we've improved it so that even if you select Bust or under bust options for width the total body shape is enabled in the simple details category so you can take advantage of the total body shape feature even if you don't know the weight so let's select bust circumference option in the width and then select the simple in the details category and when you do select simple the total body shape is enabled as you can see so you can use any body shape that you want and note that if you check proportion in the total body and then select cfnet to waste as an option the simple type option will be disabled in the details this is because the simple type has an inseam item but not a CF neck to waste item use this option to create a total body shape you want by only entering the simplified values we hope that these UI improvements will make it even easier for you to use the Avatar editor in this version we have also improved posing symmetrically using Avatar x-ray joints so to show you how this works I'll bring in an avatar and switch to the X-ray joint view of course you can use the hotkey shift X as well so now when we have our x-ray joints enabled I'm now able to edit and I'll zoom in here and perhaps use this elbow as an example so once we click the joint the icon above enables you to toggle on symmetry so in version 7.1 we were able to rotate joints on either side of the body like this symmetrically and in this version we've added the ability to do this with the arrows as well hopefully this makes it a lot easier for you to create symmetrical poses for your projects and one final but final update for our Avatar in this version is that you can now set the eye position or gaze very easily by selecting the Avatar and over in the properties you'll find this new item called eye control so horizontal and vertical is just going to allow you to manipulate the Gaze left and right up and down sort of get an idea of what you can do with this let's hop over into render mode and I'll just refresh the project it's a complete project with scenery and also it'll take a moment and what we're going to do now is set up our camera view and we want our 3D viewer and our render preview to be aligned and I'll explain why that is in just a moment okay so let's set up our avatars gaze so that he's looking directly to camera first select the Avatar and make your adjustments in the property editor notice that it's live updating there of course in a 3D window but we don't see that refreshed in the render preview and that's because we're changing the avatars mesh so make your adjustments with your camera view in the correct position in the 3D window once you've got it set to how you want it to look and in this case we're trying to have him look towards camera and that looks good then just simply update and then complete your render so hopefully this makes it a lot easier for you to create more Dynamic presentations have fun and get creative because as we can see in this example here it creates a drastically different mood now I'm happy to share a feature I know many you're going to love and that's the ability to easily apply Graphics over connecting seam lines as of version 7.2 so first in order to use the feature there does need to be a sewing relationship between the pattern and the internal line as we have here so I have a Graphic already in my object browser so to begin with I'll drag and drop it onto my front pattern as you can see by default the graphic is still only going to apply to the pattern that you've placed it on so now you'll find in your graphics properties this new item to toggle on over seam line so turn that on first and then using the sub layer tool we need to set up our layers so with this tool selected all of the pattern outlines will just be outlined now you just need to select the patterns you want to connect so my pocket to my front body this icon in the center indicates the direction plus is placing it on top minus will place it underneath and if you do need to remove it just select and delete the arrow so I'll just quickly reset these layers and look now we can see the graphic has seamlessly applied across both of those patterns so let's have a look at another application this time applying a graphic over multiple seam lines on the pant Style so just like before but this time applying a graphic that needs to be placed across multiple patterns first I'll just drag and drop in a simple copy resize it and reposition it we can see it needs to cross over the pocket pieces as well as the front of the pants as we can see here here we can use a similar process starting with toggling on over seam line and we can see the front and back joining seams I already have the graphic displayed for the pockets which sit on top we do need to use again the sub layer tool to connect the pockets to the front and the back pants with the plus symbol indicating that they are placed on top on closer inspection we can see that this is not a perfect alignment and you may see this when you have patterns that have a natural slope like the curvature of the side seam in the pant in this case disconnect as I am doing here and rather use the previous process of placing an additional graphic and making the manual adjustments we hope to improve the over seam line feature to enable you to use it with sloped patterns in future but for now we hope that this update makes your workflow a little smoother from 7.2 you can now also View and add costs for your zippers in the bill of materials so from the editor into the bill of materials here is our bom editor so first select the color weight you would like to cost here we've got all of our fabrics and trims and in previous versions The Zipper information was not displayed so here you'll notice that we have The Zipper information for all of our components and you now have the ability to add cost for this item and then once you update and refresh you'll now have a more accurate reflection of your cost estimates for the new version 7.2 there are also some updates to the colorway editor that will make it easy for you to identify the item you have selected so to demonstrate first I will use the top Stitch so I have a top Stitch here just note that this particular feature only works when the type is set to texture so in order to more easily identify the top Stitch starting with this colorway I double click the top stitch in the colorway editor and here notice that it's now been highlighted in yellow in the 3D window the same workflow also applies for the graphics so here we have a tiger graphic applied to the handbag if I double click here in the colorway editor it will be highlighted in yellow in the 3D window so we can also use this to identify trims as well as fabrics and in this case it will be highlighted in the 3D viewer and also up in the object browser so for this particular style I have two Fabrics in my object browser now if I go into my colorway and I want to identify this one double click it and notice that it's highlighted also in blue in the object browser as well as in yellow in the 3D window so we can also use this for trims so in my bag style I have a little bag stand down the bottom here and if I double click the bag stand it's highlighted in yellow and up in the object browser if I go into the trims tab we can see that it's been highlighted here in blue as well another update in 7.2 that I know is going to make many of you very happy is that we have removed the minimum length for the so until now our minimum length for fur was set to four millimeters making it difficult to express a range of shorter fur types like flocking and in this particular example we can see if I come in a little bit closer more millimeters is too long to realistically Express this kind of material detail so in the furbase properties you can now reduce the length of your fur all the way down to 0.1 hopefully broadens the scope of fabrics and details that you're able to express with realism in Clone another feature that we have added for rendering in 7.2 is color mapping which is going to help you get correct exposure for different Fabrics so first in your render settings you'll Now find this color mapping option and the first is Reinhardt with a default burn value of one which I'll now explain so let's switch on interactive render and see what this is all about so first of all at this point with our white fabric we can see this area is Overexposed and this is similar to what we would see in a linear workflow from the previous version but by adjusting this burn value I'll bring it down to 0.5 and refreshing my render preview we can see that overexposure has been corrected so play with the settings depending on your project the closer the burn value is to zero then more it will correct for overexposure now let's check out HSV exponential this is going to preserve the Hue and color saturation rather than washing towards White so when I refresh the render preview here the effect that we see is going to be subtle and notice that the creaminess of that leather bag is now coming back through because it's preserving the color so depending on your project you can now more easily correct for exposure and color with color mapping so that is our wrap on 7.2 I hope you learned a lot during this webinar we're really excited to share these new features and improvements with you if you have any questions feel free to share
