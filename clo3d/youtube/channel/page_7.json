        "Transcript": "in this tutorial we're going to be approaching our design a little bit different than we normally do in CL there are a couple things that we should do and keep in mind as we go along the first thing is is that we're going to create this particular object larger so that we can use smaller tolerances in Clove for things like addition thickness rendering curved side geometry we won't be simulating because we're creating a solid object we're going to use freeze to help keep pieces from falling and moving and then we will hide the color in the 3D window so we don't see the freeze color we're going to use the metal material type uh towards the end and most importantly uh as with any design um we're going to start with a reference image so let's get get started by creating our main pattern shape and I'm going to use the rectangle tool here in the 2D window again we're going to be started we're going to be making this object larger than it would be in real life I'm going to make this pattern 4 in wide by 2 and 1/2 in high then I'm going to smooth all of the corners to 1/2 in then I'm going to change my particle distance to be one this is very very small and we rarely use this and when you enter this number you will get this warning it's fine we know that we're doing this and what this is going to do is it's going to give us better detail on our shape I'm going to now go ahead and bypass that and as you can see you have nice smooth Corners there now with our entire pattern piece selected we're going to offset as an internal line that that it is a very small distance away .5 in and click okay this will give us an internal line inside of our pattern piece as you can see the patter the internal line is not perfectly parallel to the edge so if we can add in a couple curve points here and move them slightly so that they are a little bit more parallel to the edge this will help the shape of our Buckle so there we're we're pretty good this is the intern inter Al line is offset parallel to the edge next I'm going to use the transform pattern tool select the internal line right click and say convert to Hole this obviously gives me a very very skinny outline of our shape now what we're going to do is Select this pattern piece and here's where we start to get our shape we are going to go down to our simulation properties and we're going to change the additional thickness rendering to a 8 mm and look what it does in our 3D window it makes our Buckle very thick it has also rounded the edges this comes from the default curv side geometry being active next we are going to make the roller that is going to go around the bottom of our Buckle I'm going to take my ellipse tool and I'm going to create a circle or an ellipse the diameter is half an inch I'm going to again change my particle distance to one and I'm going to rotate this here in the 3D window so that it begins to overlap the bottom of my Buckle then I'm going to do the same thing here where I offset as an internal line The Edge the same measurement is still in there I'm going to click okay and convert this to a hole as well in this case I am going to uncheck curved side geometry and I'm going to change the additional thickness rendering to a much higher number 75 and when I do that as you can see our piece has become more like a tube I'm going to Simply rotate this to adjust how it fits over the bottom of my Buckle it is not becoming curved like this piece here because we turned off the curved side geometry so while I have my two pieces here I'm going to shift select them both and freeze them and then here in the two 3D window is where we can show and hide the color I can say hide freeze or hide all these pieces are now in place so now let's make the prong I am just going to make a simple single prong in this tutorial so what we have here is again we're going to use the ellipse tool I'm now going to create an ellipse that is 3/4 of an inch again particle distance of one I'm going to offset the outline this is going to be a little bit different because the prong is going to be working in a little bit different way and then I'm going to convert this to a hole as well I'm going to hold shift and rotate this to 45° and then place this around my Buckle now as you can see the opening is too small and that's okay what I wanted to be able to show here is that you can easily fix this by simply selecting this internal line here with your transform pattern tool hold down shift and scale it to make it larger then you can simply move this back so that it is in the center of your circle and you can make sure that it goes around the Buckle if we look at our reference picture again you can see where we are we have the basic shape and we have the roller and let's look at what they call the prong which is the piece that will go through the belt it goes from the roller across the width of the main part of the Buckle and then around the top of the Buckle so we're going to now create that shape I'm going to use the add Point split line tool here and I'm going to add a segment point on either side of this bottom point on this ellipse that we made here and I'm going to add that point at 0.1 from the bottom center .1 from the bottom center then using my edit pattern tool I'm going to delete the very bottom Point creating a flat spot here now I'm going to select this segment rightclick and say offset pattern outline and I'm going to offset this by 2 and 1 E8 in so now you can see we're starting to get the shape of our prong I'm going to rotate this slightly here so that we can see the end here we will have to adjust its position in the 3D window next I'm going to change the curved side geometry percentage lowering it from 100 % to 25% then I'm going to again go down into under simulation properties under additional thickness rendering and change the thickness to eight so as you can see now it's still a little curve and it's very thick it's starting to look like a prong you can edit the tip here as you would like depending upon the look and feel of the Buckle prong that you would like and that's what I've done here as you can can see I've changed the tip a little bit I have also cut out a piece here on the back so that it looks a little bit more like a realistic prong and I've also offset the inside of this part so that it's not quite as thick and I curved a couple of the edges as well the the final design aspect here is that I'm going to select my Fabric and change it the material to metal and then I'm ready to export this and use this in a garment and clo to use use your belt buckle what you can do is simply go to the file menu export obj find the location where you want it to go and I'm going to call this single prong roller belt buckle just in case I want to duplicate the prong to make a double prong belt buckle here in our export obj options I'm going to make sure the select all patterns is selected single object thick you could change the scale here if you would like as we made it very large in this case you could make it say 50% I'm going to leave it at the larger scale for now and I'm going to make sure that this says save with absolute texture image file path and click okay there are two ways you can add this into your project if you are adding it into a jacket that you would like to animate you should consider adding it in as a trim the other option is to add it in as a an avatar which is what I'm doing and then going to scale it and position it so that it is within the opening of the belt around the waist and then when it's in place I will simply simulate and then lower the skin offset around the Avatar which is the belt buckle so that the belt sits closer ",
        "Summary": "# Comprehensive Guide to Designing a Belt Buckle in Clo This guide provides a detailed walkthrough for designing a belt buckle in Clo 3D. Follow these step-by-step instructions to create a solid, detailed buckle with specific features like a roller and prong. ## Step 1: Prepare Your Workspace 1. **Reference Image**: Start with a reference image of the belt buckle you want to design. This will provide guidance throughout the design process. 2. **Set Up Dimensions**: As you will be designing a larger object for finer details, remember the dimensions: - Width: 4 inches - Height: 2.5 inches - Corner Radius: 0.5 inches ## Step 2: Create the Main Pattern Shape 1. **Use the Rectangle Tool**: - Open the 2D window and select the Rectangle Tool. - Create a rectangle with the dimensions mentioned above. 2. **Smooth Corners**: - Select the rectangle and smooth all corners to a radius of 0.5 inches. 3. **Set Particle Distance**: - Change the Particle Distance to **1**. A warning may appear, but bypass it as fine details are needed. 4. **Offset Internal Line**: - With the shape selected, go to the offset tool and offset the outline by **0.5 inches** internally. 5. **Adjust Internal Line**: - Add a couple of curve points to the internal line to make it more parallel to the edge. ## Step 3: Create the Buckle Shape 1. **Convert Internal Line to Hole**: - Select the internal line, right-click, and choose “Convert to Hole.” 2. **Adjust Simulation Properties**: - Go to Simulation Properties and set the Additional Thickness Rendering to **8 mm**. This will give the buckle a thick appearance and round the edges due to the default curved side geometry being active. ## Step 4: Create the Roller 1. **Use the Ellipse Tool**: - Create a circle (or ellipse) with a diameter of **0.5 inches**. - Again, set the Particle Distance to **1**. 2. **Position and Offset**: - Rotate the ellipse to overlap the bottom of the buckle. - Offset as an internal line from the edge and convert it to a hole. 3. **Adjust Thickness**: - Uncheck curved side geometry and set the Additional Thickness Rendering to **75 mm**. This will create a cylindrical shape for the roller. ## Step 5: Create the Prong 1. **Create an Ellipse**: - Use the Ellipse Tool to create a shape that will serve as the prong, measuring **0.75 inches**. - Set the Particle Distance to **1**. 2. **Offset and Convert**: - Offset the outline and convert it to a hole. - Hold Shift and rotate the prong to **45 degrees** and position it around the buckle. 3. **Adjust Size**: - If the opening is too small, select the internal line and scale it larger while holding Shift. 4. **Shape the Prong**: - Use the Add Point Split Line tool to add segment points to create a flat spot on the prong. - Offset the pattern outline by **2.1/8 inches** to refine the shape. 5. **Final Adjustments**: - Lower the curved side geometry percentage to **25%**. - Set the Additional Thickness Rendering back to **8 mm**. Edit the prong's tip and back to create a realistic shape. ## Step 6: Finalize the Design 1. **Change Material Type**: - Select the entire design and change the material to **metal** for a realistic appearance. 2. **Freeze Components**: - Select all parts of the buckle and roller, then freeze them to prevent movement during simulation. ## Step 7: Export the Design 1. **Export as OBJ**: - Go to **File > Export > OBJ**. - Name the file (e.g., \"single prong roller belt buckle\") and choose a location to save it. - In the export options, ensure **Select All Patterns** is checked, and choose **Single Object Thick**. - Consider changing the scale if needed (e.g., 50%), but leaving it large is acceptable. - Save with **absolute texture image file path**. ## Step 8: Implement in a Project 1. **Adding to a Garment**: - You can add the buckle as a trim or as an avatar. - If using it as an avatar, scale and position it to fit within the belt area of the garment. - Simulate the design and lower the skin offset around the avatar for a realistic fit. ## Tips and Tricks - **Design Scale**: Designing larger than actual size allows for finer details and easier manipulation of the shape. - **Particle Distance**: Lower particle distance results in higher detail but may slow down rendering. Use it judiciously. - **Material Types**: Experiment with different materials to see how they affect the appearance of your design. - **Simulation Properties**: Adjust simulation properties as needed to achieve the desired thickness and shape. By following these steps and tips, you will successfully create a detailed belt buckle design in Clo that can be used in various garment projects."

        "Summary": "Certainly! Below is a comprehensive guide based on the provided transcript. This guide includes step-by-step instructions, definitions, tips, and tricks related to creating a pattern shape and roller in a design or 3D modeling program. --- # Comprehensive Guide to Creating a Buckle and Roller in 3D Design ## Tools Required - **2D and 3D Design Software**: Ensure you have software that allows for 2D and 3D modeling (e.g., Adobe Illustrator, CAD software, or similar). - **Rectangle Tool**: For creating the main shape. - **Ellipse Tool**: For creating circular shapes. ## Step-by-Step Instructions ### Step 1: Create the Main Pattern Shape 1. **Select the Rectangle Tool**: Open the 2D window in your design software. 2. **Draw a Rectangle**: Click and drag to create a rectangle that will form the base of your buckle. 3. **Smooth Corners**: - Locate the corner rounding option in your software. - Set the radius to **1/2 inch** to smooth all corners of the rectangle. ### Step 2: Adjust Particle Distance 1. **Set Particle Distance**: - Find the particle distance setting in your software. - Change this value to **1** to define the spacing between the particles or elements in your design. ### Step 3: Offset Internal Line 1. **Offset the Shape**: - Select the rectangle you created. - Use the offset tool to create an internal line that is a very small distance away from the main shape. - This will create a smaller rectangle inside the original one. ### Step 4: Transform the Pattern 1. **Use the Transform Pattern Tool**: - Select the internal line created in the previous step. - Right-click to open the context menu and select **Invert to Hole**. This will create a hole in the middle of your shape, giving it a buckle appearance. ### Step 5: Adjust Simulation Properties 1. **Access Simulation Properties**: - Navigate to the simulation properties panel in your software. 2. **Change Thickness Rendering**: - Set the **additional thickness rendering** to **8 mm**. This will visually thicken the buckle in the 3D view. ### Step 6: Create the Roller 1. **Select the Ellipse Tool**: - Switch to the ellipse tool in your software. 2. **Draw a Circle**: - Click and drag in the 2D window to create a circle that will represent the roller. 3. **Position the Circle**: - Rotate the circle in the 3D window so that it overlaps the bottom of the buckle. This may involve using the rotation tools to adjust the angle. ### Step 7: Offset the Roller Shape 1. **Offset Internal Line for the Roller**: - Just like with the buckle, select the circle and apply the offset tool to create an internal line. - This will allow you to create a similar effect for the roller that matches the buckle design. ## Definitions - **Rectangle Tool**: A tool used to create rectangular shapes in 2D design software. - **Ellipse Tool**: A tool for creating circular or elliptical shapes. - **Particle Distance**: The distance between particles or points within a shape, affecting how densely they are packed. - **Transform Pattern Tool**: A tool that allows for the manipulation of shapes and patterns in the design space. - **Invert to Hole**: A command that changes a shape from a solid object to a hollow one by creating a hole in the center. ## Tips and Tricks - **Use Grids and Guides**: Utilize grids or alignment guides to keep your shapes aligned and proportionate. - **Experiment with Thickness**: Adjust the thickness rendering to see how different measurements affect the overall design aesthetics. - **Save Versions**: Save your work frequently and consider saving different versions of your design to revert to earlier states if needed. - **Preview in 3D**: Regularly switch to the 3D view to visualize your design and make adjustments accordingly. - **Undo Command**: Familiarize yourself with the undo command (usually Ctrl+Z or Cmd+Z) in case you make a mistake while designing. By following this guide, you should be able to create a buckle and roller design efficiently while understanding the tools and processes involved. Happy designing!"

        "Summary": "## Comprehensive Guide to Creating a Sequin Top Stitch This guide outlines step-by-step instructions for creating a sequin top stitch similar to a design you have in mind. We will cover the tools and techniques required, definitions for key concepts, and tips to enhance your design. ### Step 1: Create the Sequin Shape 1. **Open Your Design Software**: Launch the software you are using for designing (e.g., Adobe Illustrator, CorelDRAW, or a 3D modeling software). 2. **Use the Ellipse Tool**: - Select the **Ellipse Tool** from your toolbar. - Click and drag on your 2D window to create a circular shape that will represent your sequin. 3. **Create Internal Ellipse**: - With the Ellipse Tool still selected, create a smaller circle inside the first one. - This inner circle represents the hole of the sequin. 4. **Convert to Hole**: - Select the inner ellipse and look for the option to **Convert to Hole** (this may vary based on software; in some programs, it might be called \"Subtract\" or \"Difference\"). - This will create a ring shape that mimics a sequin. ### Step 2: Adjust in the 3D Window 1. **Zoom into the Sequin**: - Switch to your 3D window and zoom in on the sequin design. 2. **Tilt the Sequin**: - Select the sequin shape and use the rotation tool to tilt it slightly. This tilt will give it a “kissing effect,” similar to how buttons on a suit jacket are arranged. Aim for a subtle tilt for a realistic effect. ### Step 3: Arrange in the UV Editor 1. **Open the UV Editor**: - Locate and open the UV Editor in your software. 2. **Place Pattern Piece**: - Drag your sequin design into the UV Editor. - Position the pattern piece in the center of the UV space. 3. **Enlarge with Space**: - Scale up the sequin design slightly, ensuring there is a little bit of space around it. This allows for better texture mapping and visual appeal. ### Step 4: Export the Sequin Design 1. **Export as OBJ**: - Once you’re satisfied with your design in the UV editor, go to the export option. - Select **Export** and choose to export your design as an **OBJ file**. This format is commonly used for 3D models. ### Step 5: Load into Top Stitch Section 1. **Open Object Browser**: - Navigate to the **Object Browser** section of your software. 2. **Select Default Top Stitch**: - Click on the default top stitch option in the object browser. 3. **Access Shape Settings**: - Scroll down to find the **Shape** settings and click on the little **plus icon** next to it. 4. **Load Exported OBJ**: - Click on **File** to load your previously exported OBJ file. - Make sure to adjust the **Axis Conversion** settings: - Set it to **Y-Z Up** and **X**. - Ensure you **invert the Z-axis** for proper alignment. ### Additional Tips and Tricks - **Experiment with Colors**: Try using different colors or textures for your sequins to create unique designs. - **Use Layers**: If your software supports layers, utilize them to keep your design organized and editable. - **Preview Frequently**: Regularly switch between 2D and 3D views to see how your design translates across dimensions. - **Save Your Work**: Frequently save your project to prevent loss of work due to crashes or errors. - **Seek Inspiration**: Look at pictures of sequin tops or other designs for inspiration and ideas on how to improve your own design. ### Conclusion By following these steps, you should be able to create a stylish and visually appealing sequin top stitch design. Remember to explore and play around with different techniques to make your design unique and personal. Happy designing!"

        "Transcript": "hey everyone I'm Daniel from the CL 3D Munich office in Germany in this tips and tricks video I want to show you how to create custom top stitches in part one we will focus on a simple sequin top Stitch and in part two we will focus on a more advanced top Stitch with coins so let's get right into it for the first part we want to create a very easy sequin top Stitch that looks similar to the one in this picture first we need to create the sequin that we want to use in our 2D window with the ellipse tool we will create a sequin that is 5 mm in diameter by simply clicking with the ellipse pattern tool from my 2D toolbar in my 2D space and putting in the exact measurements we want then we want to create another ellipse in the Middle with my internal line ellipse tool that is 2.2 mm wide we are going to rightclick the internal ellipse that we just created and click convert to Hole to actually have a hole in the center now we will change the particle distance to 0.8 in the property editor for these small objects to get the highest possible verticy count also I want to change the fabric thickness slightly to 0.2 mm after this I want to zoom in on the sequin in the 3D window select it and tilt it a little bit to achieve a kissing effect like you see in kissing buttons on a suit jacket to do that we want to duplicate the sequin and place it a little bit higher in the 2D window to see if it works when it's repeated this can be a little bit of a back and forth process until it repeats perfectly after we have a perfect repetition we can delete the duplicated sequin as we don't need it anymore now that it fits nicely we can have a look into our UV editor here we want to place our pattern piece in the middle and enlarge it with a little bit of space around our simple sequin is done so we can already export it as an obj for this we click on file export and then obj select the name and click save we want to export our sequin with thickness so we have to check single object thick and unified UV coordinates an image size of 1,24 pixels is enough detail for us in this example for the sides we will put 1 mm at fil texture seams you can see that our fil texture adds in the hole and on the edges of our sequin that's the reason why we left a little bit of space around it beforehand then we can click okay to export it in our top Stitch section in the object browser we can click on the default top stitch in the property editor of the existing top Stitch we scroll down a little bit to shape and click on the little plus icon next to it when the new window opens up we want to load our previously exported obj under file and change the access conversion to y z up and X be sure to invert the z-axis in our preview window we can now see how it will look then we click okay to finish to change the fabric type of our new top Stitch we go to material type and select iridescent render only if we wanted we could also change the colors and other things in the effects settings below but for this example I will leave it as it is now that we created our custom top Stitch we can test it for this I'm going to create a new Fabric and create a simple rectangle in my 2D window with an internal line on top I will also change the particle distance to one so our internal line is showing smoothly then we will select our top Stitch tool in the 2D toolbx bar and apply our top Stitch to the internal line when we have a look into our 3D window we can already see how it looks like on our rectangle remember the iridescent effect will show only in the render so in our 3D window it will show only in white the last things we want to change are the offset Z offset and space between the top stitch for this we will go in the property editor of our top Stitch and change the offset to zero and the space in the specifications to Min - 0.1 CM now our sequence r on the line and the negative space settings gave us the kissing effect we talked about earlier for the Z offset we need to select our top Stitch tool and then our top stitch on the internal line in the property editor we will change the Z offset to 0.01 so the sequence Li directly on the fabric now now I will tilt the whole fabric a little bit just to get some better light Reflections in the sequence when we render finally we can go into our render and see in the render preview if everything worked out for us now we can also see the iridescent effect on the sequence if we would render our image it could look something like this after we finished we can of course save our custom sequin for the next project by going to the top of the property editor of top Stitch click save choose a location and click okay for the second part we want to create a top Stitch that consists of two coins that are arranged a bit differently and have their own textures first we need to create the two coins in our 2D window with the ellipse tool it will be 2 cm in diameter we'll set the particle distance to 0.8 again for the highest detail then we want to bring in the two coin textures that I chose and addit it beforehand we will drag and drop these into our graphic section in the object browser by selecting both we can also create a normal map from the existing textures by simply setting the intensity slider to one in the property editor this will give us a little bit more realism next I will drag and drop and fit my images to the two ellipse pattern pieces we just created for even more realism we want to have our textures on both sides of the fabric after clicking the textures with our texture tool we can then select both to change it if we move around our coins in the 3D window we can now see the textures on both sides in the fabric section we will duplicate the default fabric first then change both material types from fabric mat to metal and decrease the roughness to match our textures we then want to change the color to something close close to the textures as well and change fabric thickness to 1   mm we also want to change the curvature on the edges so we need to select both ellipses with the transform pattern tool first and then change the side curvature to 50% this will flatten the edges instead of being very round next I want to work on the arrangement in the 3D window I will tilt and move the coins a little bit to achieve the kissing effect like we did with the first sequin we can test if the repeat works by duplicating the coins and when we finish we can delete them again this can be a little bit of a back and forth process until it repeats perfectly to get the textures correct we need to prepare our UVS in the UV editor after enlarging charging we want to place them with a little bit of space around for our fill textures last step of creating the coins is to export them again we will check the exact same properties as in the first part and click okay after exporting we can create our top Stitch Again by clicking the default top stitch in the top Stitch section and clicking the little plus icon next to the shape options in the new window we import our coins obj and set the aess con version to the same orientation as before Yus Z up and x one thing we want to change here is going to our property editor and change the material type to fabric shiny this will give us a little bit more reflection now that we created our custom top Stitch we will test it again for this I'm going to create a new rectangle with an internal line on top then I will go into my top Stitch tool in my 2D toolbar and apply our coins top Stitch when we zoom out in our 3D window we can already see how it looks on our rectangle like before the last thing I want to change again is the offset and space between the top stitches for this I will go in the property editor of the top Stitch and change the offset from the internal line to zero and the space between the stitches or coins in this case to Min -1 CM for the Z offset we will select our top stitch on the internal line and change it to 0 01 mm as before so the coins lay flat on the fabric now that we are done we can preview our result in the rendom preview again and render it if we wanted   to I did my rendering beforehand so it could look like this finally as you already know we can save the toop Stitch again for another project and that's it there are of course so many options on what you can create with this workflow from different shapes to different materials and with the option to import your own objs there's almost No Boundaries on what you can create with it so I hope you enjoyed this tips and tricks video and you can tell us in the comments if it worked for you hope to see you in the next one take care   bye ",
        "Summary": "# Comprehensive Guide to Creating Custom Top Stitches In this guide, we will break down the steps presented in the transcript for creating custom top stitches using software tools. The process consists of two parts: creating a simple sequin top stitch and an advanced coin top stitch. ## Part 1: Creating a Simple Sequin Top Stitch ### Step 1: Create the Sequin 1. **Open the 2D Window**: Launch your software and navigate to the 2D workspace. 2. **Select the Ellipse Tool**: Choose the ellipse pattern tool from your 2D toolbar. 3. **Draw the Sequin**: - Click once in the 2D space to create an ellipse. - Enter the following dimensions: **Diameter: 5 mm**. 4. **Create the Inner Hole**: - Use the internal line ellipse tool to create a smaller ellipse in the center. - Set the diameter of this inner ellipse to **2.2 mm**. - Right-click on the internal ellipse and select **Convert to Hole**. ### Step 2: Adjust Properties 1. **Change Particle Distance**: In the property editor, set the particle distance to **0.8** to maximize vertex count. 2. **Adjust Fabric Thickness**: Set the fabric thickness to **0.2 mm**. ### Step 3: Create the Kissing Effect 1. **Zoom into the Sequin**: Switch to the 3D window and zoom in on the sequin. 2. **Duplicate the Sequin**: Create a copy of the sequin and position it slightly higher in the 2D window. 3. **Test for Repetition**: Move the duplicated sequin and adjust its position to check if the kissing effect works when repeated. - Continue adjusting until the effect looks good. 4. **Delete the Duplicate**: Once satisfied with the positioning, delete the duplicated sequin. ### Step 4: Prepare for Export 1. **UV Editor**: Open the UV editor and position your pattern piece in the center, ensuring some space around it. 2. **Export as OBJ**: - Click on **File**, then **Export** and select **OBJ**. - Set the following parameters: - **Export with Thickness**: Check \"Single Object Thick.\" - **Unified UV Coordinates**: Ensure this is checked. - **Image Size**: Set to **1.24 pixels**. - **Fil Texture Seams**: Set to **1 mm**. - Click **OK** to finalize the export. ### Step 5: Create the Top Stitch 1. **Select Default Top Stitch**: In the object browser, click on the default top stitch. 2. **Add Custom Shape**: - In the property editor, scroll down to \"Shape\" and click the plus icon. - Load the previously exported OBJ file. - Set Access Conversion to **Y Z Up** and **X**. - Invert the Z-axis in the preview window and click **OK**. 3. **Change Material Type**: Set the material to **Iridescent Render Only**. 4. **Adjust Colors and Effects**: (Optional) Change colors or other effects if desired. ### Step 6: Testing the Top Stitch 1. **Create a New Fabric**: In the 2D window, create a simple rectangle with an internal line on top. 2. **Change Particle Distance**: Set the particle distance to **1** for smooth internal lines. 3. **Apply Top Stitch**: Use the top stitch tool to apply your custom top stitch to the internal line. 4. **Check in 3D Window**: View the result; the iridescent effect will only be visible in the render. 5. **Adjusting Offsets**: - In the property editor, set **Z Offset** to **0.01 mm**. - Set **Space** to **Min - 0.1 cm** to achieve the desired spacing effect. ### Step 7: Render the Design 1. **Preview the Render**: Check the render preview to see the final look. 2. **Final Export**: Save your custom sequin for future projects by going to the top of the property editor for the top stitch, clicking **Save**, selecting a location, and clicking **OK**. ## Part 2: Creating a Coin Top Stitch ### Step 1: Create the Coins 1. **Open the 2D Window**: Ensure you are in the 2D workspace. 2. **Select the Ellipse Tool**: Create two ellipses for the coins, each with a diameter of **2 cm**. 3. **Set Particle Distance**: Again, set the particle distance to **0.8** for high detail. ### Step 2: Import Textures 1. **Drag and Drop Textures**: Bring in the coin textures you prepared by dragging them into the graphic section of the object browser. 2. **Create Normal Maps**: Select both textures and adjust the intensity slider to **1** in the property editor for realism. ### Step 3: Apply Textures 1. **Assign Textures**: Fit the textures to the two ellipse pattern pieces. 2. **Double-Sided Textures**: Ensure that you apply the textures on both sides of the fabric. ### Step 4: Adjust Fabric Properties 1. **Duplicate Default Fabric**: Create a duplicate of the default fabric. 2. **Change Material Types**: Switch from fabric material to **Metal** and adjust the roughness to match the textures. 3. **Set Color and Thickness**: Modify the color to match the textures and set the fabric thickness to **1 mm**. ### Step 5: Modify Edge Curvature 1. **Select Both Ellipses**: Using the transform pattern tool, select both coins. 2. **Adjust Side Curvature**: Change the side curvature to **50%** to flatten the edges. ### Step 6: Create the Kissing Effect 1. **Position Coins in 3D Window**: Tilt and arrange the coins to achieve the kissing effect. 2. **Test the Repeat**: Duplicate the coins to check for perfect repetition before finalizing their position. ### Step 7: Prepare for Export 1. **UV Editor**: Prepare the UVs, enlarging and spacing them appropriately. 2. **Export the Coins**: Follow the same export steps as in the first part (OBJ with the same properties). ### Step 8: Create the Coin Top Stitch 1. **Select Default Top Stitch**: Similar to the first part, click on the default top stitch. 2. **Add Custom Shape**: - Load the exported coin OBJ and set the access conversion as before. - Change the material type to **Fabric Shiny** for additional reflection. ### Step 9: Testing the Coin Top Stitch 1. **Create a New Rectangle**: In the 2D window, create a rectangle with an internal line. 2. **Apply Coin Top Stitch**: Use the top stitch tool to apply your custom coin top stitch. 3. **Adjust Offsets**: Set the offset to **0**, spacing to **Min - 1 cm**, and Z offset to **0.01 mm**. ### Step 10: Render and Save 1. **Preview Render**: Use the render preview to see the final design. 2. **Final Save**: Save your custom coin top stitch for future projects. ## Tips and Tricks - **Experiment with Shapes**: Feel free to create different shapes and materials to expand your design possibilities. - **Utilize UV Mapping**: Proper UV mapping is crucial for achieving perfect texture alignment. - **Test Repetitions**: Always test how your designs repeat to ensure consistency in your patterns. - **Save Frequently**: Regularly save your work to avoid losing progress. By following these steps, you will be able to create custom top stitches using sequins and coins effectively. Enjoy experimenting with different materials and designs!"

t-shirt and image for example a star how easy you can add a line of rhinestones by our great top Stitch function I already uploaded the Garment and image onto my workspace first step I will draw the outlines from my star shape with the polygon tool and on fold the trace shape to have it symmetric after this is done I select the shape and clone as internal shape which I can now Place onto my pattern for this tutorial I will place it in the front of course you can still adjust a modified position now or afterwards as soon you have set down your internal shape you can now delete the star pattern the Second Step will be to create your rhinestone own top stitch for this you can go into the object browser under the folder top Stitch and copy the existing default top Stitch with double click on the text field you can change the title afterwards I will change in the property editor the offsets on zero and go to specification to shape and click on the plus where I can change the shape of my top Stitch a popup window shows up where you can add your rhinestone OBG this specific OBG you can find VIA closet connect and download it or even make your own rhinestone OBG for example with blender you directly see an example picture how your top Stitch will look like and adjust the size or shape between each Stone clicking on okay you completed the adding and now you can change the material type to gem with the change your top Stitch becomes the optical of a rhinestone also if you scroll down you can change the color adjust the optical and the reflection you can try out and set it in the way you like it best I prefer to set the reflection roughness to 20 and also change the reflection of the Abby number the Abby number indicates the degree of light dispersion higher Abby numbers mean lower dispersion reduce chromatic adoration and higher visual quality of the gem The Next Step will be to add the top Stitch with our free top Stitch tool on the internal line and by zooming onto my 3D window you will see the rhinestones on top of the Garment for also a better look how great The Rhinestone looks you can check with our render by just going into our interactive render setting and scrolling into the top stitch by moving and rotating you can see how the light breaks into the stone and reflects back going further on I would now like to add more rhinestone stars to my garment by just copy and pasting with the transform pattern tool you can place inside the pattern turn the star you can scale or rotate and create multiple designs next to that you can also add more lines into your Star by just selecting your shape and clicking with the right Mouse and select offset as internal line directly a popup window appears and you can modify new lines and you can see directly the changes for now I will add just one line with a specific measurement and add my rhinestone top stitch on top after words I would love to change the color by just copying the rhinestone top Stitch and changing in the property editor the color and assigning with the eded top Stitch tool to the top stitch in the 2D window we have easily have changed our rhinestone color also here by just going into the render program you can check how the color will approximately look on the finished rendered project on this topic I will show you how to create a rhinestone as a bottom with the object file this gives you the possibility to position a single Stone very flexible and free first I will go to the object browser to my bottom tile and copy my default button afterwards I jump into the property editor where I can select the shape of the button and click on the plus next to the library selection next a popup window shows up where I can now add the desired shape I want by giving the new button name adding an image and also the object file in the lower part you quickly can create your desired shape as a button also you can adjust measurements by typing in by clicking on okay you have registered the new button into your library in the object browser and property editor you can already see that the shape here the rhinestone is activated The Next Step would be to change the material to gem which only gets active by the render scrolling down the property Eder you can change the color and adjust the reflection or refle fraction as light now let's add the rhinestone to our garment by just going into the 3D tool button you can easily click on the 2D window on your pattern and place the rhinstone you directly can see the placement on your 3D window you can see how easy and creative you can be with this tool and how flexible you can work with it next to this you can also change the category of the botton to trim and classify it as rhinestone with this two clicks this software now knows it's a rhinestone which helps a lot with the settings of your billof materials after creating your rhinestone image with the needed positions and updates you can now dive into rendering and check out how the rhinestones will look on your finished garment with just these two tools you can be really creative and develop your own rhinestone designs with clone and through rendering the rhinestones get their full reflection power and visual full effect on this note thanks for watching this tutorial and for more tutorials about other topics subscribe to our   Channel ",

        "Summary": "# Comprehensive Guide to Rendering Lights in CLA This guide will provide you with a thorough understanding of the different types of lights available in CLA (Computer Lighting Application), how to use them effectively, and tips and tricks for optimizing your lighting setup. ## Overview of Light Types In CLA, there are **six different types of lights** you can use to enhance your rendering: 1. **Rectangle Light** 2. **Sphere Light** 3. **Directional Light** 4. **Spotlight** 5. **IES Light** ### Definitions - **Rectangle Light**: This light type emits light from a rectangular area, creating soft shadows and a natural light spread. - **Sphere Light**: This light emits light from a point in all directions, creating a spherical light effect, suitable for simulating point sources. - **Directional Light**: This light type simulates sunlight; it casts parallel rays in a specific direction, creating strong shadows. - **Spotlight**: This light emits a cone of light focused on a specific area, useful for creating dramatic effects or highlighting particular objects. - **IES Light**: This type utilizes IES (Illuminating Engineering Society) profiles to simulate real-world light fixtures and their distribution patterns. ## Step-by-Step Instructions ### Activating and Showing Lights 1. **Activating Lights**: - Open your CLA project. - Navigate to the lighting panel. - Select the type of light you want to activate from the list of six. 2. **Showing Lights in 3D**: - Once a light is activated, ensure it's visible in the 3D viewport. - Adjust the view settings if needed to see the light placement. 3. **Showing Lights in Render**: - Go to the render settings. - Ensure the light visibility option is enabled for your selected light. ### Adjusting Light Properties 1. **Adjusting Intensity**: - Locate the intensity control in the light properties panel. - You can either: - **Manually Input a Value**: Type in the desired intensity value. - **Use the Slider**: Drag the slider left or right to increase or decrease the intensity. 2. **Adjusting Light Angle**: - Depending on the light type, locate the angle adjustment setting. - Use the slider or input a specific angle to modify the light's spread (for spotlight and directional lights). 3. **Locking Light to Camera**: - In the light properties, find the option to lock the light to the camera. - Enable this option so that the light will follow camera movements, ensuring it stays in the desired position relative to the view. ### Activating Ground Shadow 1. **Activating Ground Shadow**: - Look for the shadow settings in the light properties panel. - Click the icon to activate the ground shadow feature. 2. **Adjusting Shadow Intensity**: - Similar to light intensity, you can adjust the shadow intensity by: - **Manually Inputting a Value**: Enter the desired shadow intensity. - **Using the Slider**: Adjust the slider to achieve the desired shadow effect. ## Tips and Tricks - **Use Multiple Light Sources**: Combining different types of lights can create a more dynamic and realistic scene. Experiment with placing various light types in strategic locations. - **Test Renders**: Conduct test renders frequently to see how adjustments to lighting affect the overall look of your scene. - **Play with Color**: Don’t forget that lights can also have color. Adding colored lights can enhance mood and atmosphere. - **Consider Shadow Quality**: High-quality shadows enhance realism. Adjust shadow settings for each light according to the scene's needs. - **Utilize Light Groups**: Group lights together if they perform a similar function, making it easier to adjust multiple lights simultaneously. - **Save Presets**: If you find a light setup you like, save it as a preset for future projects to save time. By following this comprehensive guide, you will be well-equipped to utilize the lighting features in CLA effectively, enhancing the quality and realism of your renderings."
