once you complete it click ok to finalize your design if you like to go back to the default settings simply hit the reset button and then i removed to talk about the new features we added a new tooth in 6.1 which caught the select mesh wash too it was originally coming from marvelous designer and it will be very useful for cloud users in these two vacancy less certain areas of the mesh for subsidified please solidify and add pins you can find it in the same sub menu under select mesh box 2 and pin spots 2 if you activate that tooth you will get a meteor brush information box in this menu the first one is about strength here you can see decide their strength of the tube as higher the strength as the less stronger of the result it will be then for the size you can decide how big you want the brush to be as a higher as a bigger the selection area will be the third one is focal so you can decide the focus radius on your brush we can apply this focal option within the freeze options of the clip so you can use these functions in both 3d and 2d window and i will do the demonstration in the 3d window users can always zoom in and then change the fill angle to select the mesh they want and the first functions under select mesh fresh tooth is substified you can substitute certain mesh area by this tooth to make the mesh much more delicate so i select the area by these two and then right click to find options in property editor you can decide on the substitution level as higher as more delicate the mesh becomes and now i'm using value 2. if you activate smooth the transition to the regular mesh becomes more smooth to delete the subdivided area you just need to right click and select the option reset if you want to hide the color just right click on the 3d background and then select show or hide color and select high substified mesh as you can see the area of the gathering is now much more delicate than before the second function is about freeze you can also particularly freeze your mesh if you change the focal area it will be gradually frozen as the lighter the green color as softer the frozen area will be so he can right click on the particular area and then freeze it and at the same time we can freeze multiple area and then turn on simulate to see the result if you click on the top of the area with freeze you can right click and increase the certain area and also you can also hide the color just like right click on the 3d background as before the third function is solidified you can also apply the solidified to certain areas by these two so i just hover over the area that i want to solidify and then right click and i will find options about solid 5. and when i right click on it i can unsolidify the areas it is also possible to hide the color with a right click on the 3d background the last functions of the sealab brush tooth is to add pins you can select certain mesh area and then right click to create pink after applying pin you will see it turned to red color so you can realize this is the pinned area you are able to hide those paint if needed so you can just click on the 3d vertical menu bar and then hide the pin in close 6.1 you are now having the ability to adjust your pattern within the 3d window so we can use different styling tubes below the scale style line tube will allow you to scale your pattern outlines so i'm going to change the length of the hand with this tooth by clicking on the lines then you will see two different perforated lines while holding down your select line the dot with the arrows can be adjusted to change the length light moving towards the larger arrow will lengthen the dots lined with the solid lines at the end can adjust the circumference of your hand so i just like to lengthen my hand and i'm going to use the arrow dot line and simulate you can also keep doing these changes until you satisfy with the locks i'm also going to increase my overall share confidence as well once you apply the changing by style line you can immediately to simulate and you feel the changes in 3d windows you can use this tube on any lines or seams if i want to add some furnace to my side seams i can do this to both side seam by just clicking and holding down on the side seam once and now i will get the same two lines changing when you change the length of the size c both of the top and bottom will be adjust normally if you only want to adjust the top part of the line you have to hover the top point till you see the blue arrows so by this adjustment you will only adjust the part of the line so here i can move the part nearly the underarm and make it get closer to the body if you look at my pattern in the 2d window you will see that only the underarm is changed if you like to edit the link separately like front and back side zoom you can just click on the lines once and then you will see the green and red color line and you can select one of them to adjust the lines such as back or the front and you can see they're all the changing in the 2d windows you can also select the part like the bottom part and then adjust the swap of the bag as well if you want and i will keep continue using these two to edit and adjust my 3d patterns so you can see the changings and demonstrations of using these two besides we have their added style line tooth by using these two we can select the already created points and adjust them by clicking and holding down you can create the new points by this tooth and please note that if you create a new point the line will become a curvature line it is also important to know if your pattern pieces are symmetric so other related pattern will get the same result and same changes and when you use these two you can also move the lines forward or backward and do the changing as you want the rest of the tooth for the pattern adjustment is draw style lines this tooth can help us to cut and sew new style lines on the garments so we can go through and continue to use all of these tools to make a new garment in the 3d window directly so we can have a completely new style and the garments by using these new tools within few minutes these functions help you to increase the efficiency and also the effectiveness while creating the garments and we can always do the post changing for a better presentation like this so here is the final garment and then we will talk about the next subject we decide to use the glgf format to exportable visual and physical parameters of acrylic because it is a format that is already in standard to share pvr materials amongst different 3d softwares furthermore another benefit of using gltf or glb format is it is flexible and extendable and we can always add more information by retaining into the extension sessions there is a reason why we decide to go with the gltf format to export the fabric properties instead of using the audio main to standard format like obj and fbx it is because those formats cannot contain pbr materials that they were developed before another note is about the substance out it cannot be included in the export of a gltf3 cloud and we'll see the future development in case of their substance usage like physical properties of the fabric will be directly added in the substance format after the introductions i will show you about how to export the fabric gltf so please click on the file from menu bar and then export fabric gltf glb after naming the file you can see a pop menu appeared and you will have to select which fabric one or multiple for export and you can also refer to the object browser setup tape to see which fabric you need as mentioned above a subset file cannot be included in the export so when you export the glf framing you cannot see the options and then you can select the file format for export then i will show you how to import the graphic glts files so i will apply the default fabric for the js first so to import the files you need to go to the file or menu bar import gltf and choose the object type fabric you can also check and drop a glts or glb file in the graphic item or the fabric tape in the object browser directly under the impulse setting you can choose the low type and also object type as an avatar or load it as a fabric or trees so you can select the object type depends on your nick and then click ok and then you can import the fabric that you select after import those fabric you will see in object browser fabric tape we will edit those fabric and we can directly apply the fabric as user and you can see the changing like the credit appearance and also to the banding and jpaint depends on the fabric properties and there is another way to import the fabric fabs you can right click on the drive tab and import and then select the daniel files after that you can add it as a gltf or glb format just like this danium files and then we can click ok and apply this fabric on the dress and you will see the changing after simulations and if you want to import a glf file as an albater which was earlier saved as fabric you may see a rectangle pattern pieces in the 3d window this is a normal case and it will generate a geometric to fit it into outer category and open properly and then we move to talk about the last features in close 6.1 you can now load unify maps into your 3d garments previously when applying a texture image to grabbing chloe repeats the image on that material at present there is a option to have more settings where texture images are being placed by using unified maps this is done by changing the fabric low type from texture repeat to unify map within the object browser once you have changed the rapid load type in the object browser you can apply a new event to the garments the texture image will be applied directly to your current uv layout in the uv editor mode we can change to uv editor mode to see more details on it and this is a great addition for developing engineer paints in cold like the one i have here and then i'll update the most ui and ux part and i will go through the uv editor first in close 6.1 you have the options to include top speed chain in your uv maps there are two options for this we can save the top stitch as an obj or as a texture when the top stitch type is assigned as an obj it will generate uv patterns for the top stitching within the uv editor when the top stitching type is changed from object to texture it will be converted to an image and repeat along the pattern pieces between uv layout both top stitching options can now be exported within uv map apart from exporting the uv map of object top stitch in uv edition mode we can bring the texture image and save it as new format user can set fit or uv to 0.21 and customize the pattern placement then select brake tester on right hand side too far and customize their size new area and check the texture type and you can select the setting path and name the map and save the map not only as png jpeg but also pdf in 6.1 so user can save the maps in various formats depends on your needs and here will be the result of uv map in pdf format including the diffuse and also the normal map and then we can move to the blm mode top stitch information is added into blm editor in 6.1 you can prefer the top stitch styles and the quantity depends on your garments and change the price and unit to check the cost you can also check the total cost and save the blm file as a record for internal or external communications this session will cover new prints layout modes features the first one is ruler and guideline in the vertical menu there is now an option to target the rulers within guideline while a guide is being placed it will snap to patent status or seam allowance automatically once a guide is set snap patterns to edge or seam allowance and patterns are snapped into the edge of fabric row automatically the second update is snap to pattern several options for pattern snapping are available in the right click menu and snap to pattern will cause the pattern centers to align to each other when booked the third one is test track real map snap to test grid we allow you to place patterns by snapping to the either the outline or center of the texture or paint when these options are selected the print reveal edge and center guides are changed and then the fourth one is in the snapshot show hide backgrounds and fabric in the saving image dialog box on the show image you are now able to hide pattern texture or fabric mode texture and you can also change the texture opacity at the bottom the fifth one is the snapshot also supports pdf format once appearance settings are confirmed there is an option to save this image as pdf and the last one is font tape if the bonding has been applied to any pieces a bond tape will be automatically applied with all relevant patterns and there will be one bond tape on all bonded pieces regardless of the type select in property editor here you will be able to see all of your colors in each color you can use these color shapes and you will be able to adjust all properties within your coloring that use in this specific color if i select this color here and then scroll down you will see that i have a button using this color along with some top stitch if i change this color using the color chip all of these properties will change to new color also if i go to another color chips and change it to the same color then it will combine those two color chips into one and i can then change this color and then the top stitch and the button will change it is important the name of the color chips comes from the coloring name which you can edit in the property editor so we can change the name here and you will see that all the names will be updated the color chips will also combine even you change the colors to the same just like here below if i select both of these fabric and then change their color to the same one you see in your color tape another colorway chips will combine into one if i undo it you will see the original one trap was white and one was none so these changes i've made have only affects this colorway if i want to afford another two colorways i will need to do another settings the colorway chips can also affect prints as well right now my prints are all named in white and i can change this name to print so that i can see it better in my college hips and when you adjust the color using the chips it will be a color overlay as you can see you can change it so there isn't any color on your paint as well another thing is within different names of the same color the chips will not be combined you can now hide and also show the graphics in your coloring by using these eyes you can now to easily change between all your graphic options besides you can show the same product but still add different colors for each coloring another update is emulating mode you can now set the maps when you create sleep fabric in pro emulator from concepts hormone not only texture map please enter the measured values at the same rate with cloud 6.0 and compare it into code physical properties in the stage to set the texture you can find a place to set it as normal displacement and alpha map you can also find a place for the maps about reflection as well when you press the next button and at the last stage is to complete the zip fabric after setting all maps you need for this rabbit and you can directly apply those fabric with the different mappings like normal map these payment maps and test your mat and then do the further changing in code and then we will share about the update of interface changing the ui is changed like it is possible to set the color of lines in pattern as each user wants you can find this in manual from user settings and then select user interface in user setting window and you can find the line sections in user interface and it is possible to set each color of elements by using the color palette thickness of lines can be changed as you feel comfortable for the font size of numbers which appeared when you try to check the lines linked can be also changed you don't have to restart the software after you set this setting the change will be shown directly right after you set it and then for the ssl login you can sign in in clone network online off through single scion we already provided sso features with octa scenes close 6.0 and from 6.1 you can use the sso feature from adfs if you and your company are using octa or adfs and you want to use sso in cloud please contact the code team and we will help you to do the settings from 6.1 you can select mesh by brush to select and mesh thickly you have to move the cursor a few times on the same spot when you use the three button mouse but with a tablet pen just press more depending on the pressure of the pen it is adjust the range and deep of this mesh selections as you know the color of the 3d pattern will be changed when you freeze or strengthen them from 6.1 you can set the color back to the original fabric color even you freeze or strengthen the patterns you can find the menu by right-click pop-up menu in the 3d window you can see the menus of each setting when you hover your cruiser on the short or hide color menu like this there are also some updates on the algorithms part so users now can create symmetric alpha tapes in 3d window so let's start by creating alberta tapes like using basic circumference measures under elevator and i will draw the tape on outer's left hand and then change to another outfitter tape just like minion measured and draw it on the upper stretch after having this tape we can right click and select those tape with added mesh avatar and duplicate it to symmetric positions so this helps us to save the time while doing the alpha tape creations let's move on to material updates first is about trims improvement now we can able to open trim file without pattern pieces um because to save the trim files create obj by op j we have to first load a stream type that's only possible when there was a pattern first in quote so because of these uh now we can able to open trim file even without patterns when you open obj you can select the object type as stream wide array so let's in this case i saved it as a trim file right now and then save as from the main menus and you can choose a stream files such as this showcase the ring is all rained right now as a trim file format another update is about dream item that in it can able to showcase in the list of seeds from these versions uh you can see the file are usually small in size and exist only in the 3d window so we received an opinion that we can able to locate easily by the wheel in the scenes so if you select scenes such as this case uh when you go to the first tab of the object browser you can able to see there is a clone controller at the bottom of the list and you can see the train files in the costume so if you click on the trim that you want to select here you can see that the stream is also selected in the 3d window if you select streams in the scenes the file is also select in the 3d window and make it easier to locate the trees so let's move on to our talk about the trim collisions so let's turn into the back sides of these uh bra under this of the bra straps loops we want to add in these the o-rings uh into these strap loops in the past there are some when this uh the trim file is sandwiched between the fabric like these it will comes out easily because of collisions it's not performed from these versions now the trim file can be handled with collisions so when you uh let's say now we put it in and between the bowel loops of the strap blues by gizmo and now we set the collisions and press on simulate now you can use uh the fabric as is insert this process only in the state that the training file is not glued so please make sure to use it carefully and now let's move to the front side uh to talk about another new new updates which is we are able to move the obj the multiple trim file all at once so uh the front those little stucks uh the b sorry the beats uh we are now able to using pressing the shift key to multi-select and use the gizmo to move all at once so if you want to remove several trims at once while maintaining the spacing between the trims you can select multiple functions and move them all at once by gizmo here i would love to talk about the buttons and buttonhole improvements that is the major changes of the buttons registrations because we can now register buttons in multiple sites buttons that are provided with multiple sites in one design previously used by saving individual button file for each size or by registering only one design as a file and then using the close size change functions but now if you look at the image i'm showing you right now the top line represents the buttons of various size using the later methods if you use the later methods the clone function modify the overall scales of the buttons and the size of the bottom's pro parts should be kept with also changes in this case this is actually the right way to use each buttons by size like the buttons on the bottom row however in order to use this it was necessary to save and manage individual files separately in this case this functions was developed in the aspect of managing files and usability was inconvenience first let's check the bottom tab at the top of the object browser if you select button style and go to the property editor you can click the register button here um or alternatively you can open the button registration windows by clicking materials buttons register buttons from the main menu you can enter the button information in sequence of course now you can name the buttons that used to be registered and now you can add in thumbnails of the buttons so in the case of flat button as shown in an image on the left you can create and use an image taken with the front of the buttons at the maintenance way without any margins but for buttons with a bottom post like the image on the right you can use the image taken from the side to see the bottom pose without space so let's click the register thumbnails button to load the image now following call is to register the button's information and file for each site click add size as many as the number of buttons to register then enter each button information in order of button size i will register from the smaller size first then click the button size you want to type and then go down to see where you want to type the size name is the button size name that will be displayed in the menu when using the file later you can change name to something that is easy to understand or you can use the name that is automatically generated so the second is to register the file for buttons only obj file can be registered next enter the width thickness and weight of the buttons respectively so let's enter the informations for each buttons so when you click ok at the bottom you can see the window indicating button registration is complete so this time let's use the bottom file we just create when you register a button in cloud it is add to the bottom function immediately therefore you can immediately select and use this button style that was at last in the least important steps if you want to locate a file the register button is saved in the path where cloud access is located so please right click in the library window and copy the access path and paste it into the window browse it to the bottom folder and you will see the button file you just saved so now let's quickly add the buttons and switch to the button that we registered in different sites and i just uh quickly change its check material type and colors you can play still change a job according to your designs for texture and save it using a butterfly with multiple size there's a drop down menu in the property editor where you can see a list of sites in this panel files you can change the size of the buttons in these menus if you have to enter a size other than the register sites press customs at the bottom of the drop down menu you will be able to enter your own site if you enter the sites at the bottom you can see that the button is reflected according to the size you entered at this time you can think that the obj that has changed when entering the custom sign is obj of the last used size therefore the most natural shape change is possible by selecting size that is most similar to the size you want to enter first and change it to customs when create buttons or button holds there is now an option to automatically distribute between two points instead of setting it manually with the button or button hold too right click on the patterns etch and select distributes under type in the dialog box set placement of buttons from pattern edge and stop and state start and end points now let's insert the value in the dialog box and when the number of buttons are changed district between will be automatically calculated so of the select and move button two all buttons in this group will be select together and change all the settings once now let's uh duplicate the buttons into the button holes on the other sides select them to work the select and move button choose to set the find position by measurements in 11 minutes so let's move on with texture improvements now we can open texture in ai and photoshop directly so um for this see project brow brows we see the graphics on the t-shirts and texture image on the skirts so now please select the fabrics on the skirts in object browser click open with icon next to texture that now you can have option next to all act chose either one mac to open app to open you can add new maps or design apps to open let's chose open in photoshop now we can oversee in old photoshop right now we can now freely adjust the graphics with changing the details and colors such as now i switch some details and colors and save it now let's go back to clone and while we right click appointed free space we can refresh the graphics instantly under cloud about the t-shirts that with the ai files are the placement prints uh let's use the uh transform graphic too to select the graphics and same next to the texture image under property editor let's open with hit icons and same let's open with another app which is the illustrator or photoshops of course you can chose either in photoshop so and other apps because this is ai uh adobe illustrator let's hit the illustration illustration files and instantly you opened the bio path of these graphics same you can play with different adjustments under in other apps let's quickly switch to another color holographics and save same let's go back to glow and same once we refresh the texture image so instantly you will see the changes are ins on the graphics on in cloud so now you can also adjust the tilling of your prints within the texture editor so such a space and shift the box first force of space will adjust the spacing of your upward from the side positive will have the artwork to move away negative will move the word closer so you can see it right now under the uh texture editor window so the second box of space will adjust the spacing of the artwork from above and below and the same positive will move outwards away negative will move to outward close so the first boss of ship will shift your artworks from side to side positive remove the button from that and above right negative remove the bottom right and then both left the second board for shift will shift your upwards up and down so same the positive values will shift the image up the tile image up and negative down and the reset buttons on the side will reset your numbers back to zero this telling tilling will not automatically create a seamless repeat you must continue to play around with your scale to create a slimless repeat meanwhile there's also an extra functions for a safe image of layers you can now save out your layers as a separate png images the buttons below here save image will allow you to do so do this once selected you will then be able to chose uh which layers you should like to save out if you do not want to save an image simply uncheck the box then select ok you will then uh be taken to your files window where you can chose where to save your image by selecting the folder there you will have your png image that you can use in any software so i'm going to demonstrate demonstrate some updates on the 2d tools especially the new pattern tools the very first on the update is about a new tool called spiral so here we got this uh project files uh we would like to add uh the spiral patterns uh onto the skirt bottoms for the other sides here we got already got the internal lines for the sewing path and now please hovering your mouse to the 2d button then builds and clicked polygons you drop down menus you will see the spiral tools underneath click it and use able to a same click on the random space and you will see a pop window called create spiral there are some parameters you can set to adjust the shapes of customize your shapes of these spiral patterns i'm now adjusting the inner radius as you can indicate by the blue lines from the center points i can play with the different values to adjust the shapes and of course you can adjust the length the total length of you can adjust either inner or outer length so i click it you will see the adjustments and changing of the length both in inner and outer so for sides uh is about the end side at end side length so of course the injury i can also play with adjusting the value and now stick with 20 to make it smaller shorter and i just stick with 80 at last for the outer sides length and then a fine glowy is offset is indicated by the blue lines on the 2d windows you can adjust the offsets to make it more wider or narrower i would just type in 150 millimeters for the offset and of course direction either choose clockwise or counterclockwise you can click ok when you confirm it so here you've got the customized spiral patterns so i just adjust the position and add the sewing lights accordingly to sew it on top of these front patterns panels and of course to bring pose over then you got the customs shapes of spar buttons sewing onto the dress fronts bottoms of course these two not just to make the custom shapes you can also use this tool for creating ruffles custom ruffles again i just still use the same spiral tools to and quickly insert those values for the sides and radius and laying the so on i want to sew it on to the waist so um just let me click filled times and insert the values one five seven one point five for the inner length and then i click okay again uh i got these patterns for ruffles and i just use the sewing tool to show it on to the waist lines and i'll close the ends for both ends of the ruffles seam here i used to clean both sides so that it stick alongside with the waist patterns i will use the layering tools to adjust to make sure it's uh making on top of the dress and of course i adjust uh while i simulate make sure it won't uh colliding with the underneath patterns so here we got the ruffles crates by spiral tools and there's an other update which we can set the perpendicular pattern corner upon the patterns so here we focus on the bottom edge the sides seams of the dress right sides so i just quickly shift to the monochrome surface for this plate and i use active pattern two to select the corner and right kick to see the perpendicular pattern corner and you see the pop windows you can adjust the length and directions so here i insert the values to 10 millimeters for the length and click okay so instantly you see there's a blue base lines indicating the perpendicular corner of course i now quickly do onto the other sides same click apply right click upon the the corners perpendicular pattern corner now so you instantly got these um smoothened edge of the size in bottoms so here we got another improvements for the dark creations um here we got another updates about dots improvements so uh we got these shirts for defaults at the back side back your area we won't add a duck so we use this seven points right click at dots this time for a dots window we got the shapes dot cap chat the boards if you click checked then you can we'll have these uh sticks to uh curb points to let you guys to adjust the shapes of these dark caps you can slide and move around those curved points to indicate the fault lines so of course you can right click to delete those curve points so once you click enter you got these uh dark shapes uh customized with those occurred points accordingly so of course now let's just undo it and now if we create dots without shape that kept box checked he's still able to guide the dark shapes product caps auto generate to the most accurate there is also some update about notch improvements so now right now you can simply use active pattern to right click and you see the drop down options called at notch and also you can use active curve points uh to add notch directly from the right kick manuals and there are also another date which is right now you can able to not lock the notch positions so in this case we use notch 2 and click a random point on the stiff prongs and now you see there are a lot options under property editor click on then you can able to either lock depending on which from the start or endpoints and able to insert the values for the distance for the locked area so in this case you can see the logos with the locked icon and indicating the arrows for the directions and now on whenever you use the f the curvature of the curvature or at the curve points you can uh to change the unlocked sides the notch positions will still stick on to the point that you indicate the beginnings you can simply also optimize the curve points and for the other side that you locked it now whenever i move the uh at the curve point change the curvature uh for for the outlines they still stick onto the position that i indicate at the beginning so uh this please note that this lock feature does not work for a notch that already at the segments or curve point since it is it does not have the both directions indicated so in this uh i just chose the other area that i switched to endpoints as locked positions and i indicate two millimeters from the endpoints or on just one so whenever i change the curvature same using at the curved points it will now not affecting the notch positions and now event i adjust the curvature i'm still able to check these endpoint positions for grading updates uh now we can change the stack points of the pattern so in these uh shirts we got already three grade size just use add degrading tool by select the patterns such as now i select the sleeve patterns then of course you can able to see a right kick you can able to see the align options with different function stacking positions so you can chose either from left from the right bottom top or center middles or even a combination of center and middle so you see now i just simply click the patterns and right click the patterns and play with different directions right now so this is more uh easy to aligning all the patterns uh stacking positions so besides that you can also select the coins and right click to get the align options along either in x or y assets or even both x and y assets so i use these under armed points or the backs to select the stacking positions besides that there are also a pom updates aligning with the gradient length so in this case i just quickly add the pom for the front so instantly you see the different uh the grading length and also even this works on the diagonal lines uh the vom so right now i just add on from the front to the armholes so you also can see this uh different grading length another improvement is for offset internal line and this versions we are able to add on both sides at the same time so start by adding an internal lines at the front on these jackets right now and now i use added button two to select uh offset as internal lights now for the top windows for the offsets we are still uh able to insert distance with the number of offsets but this time under options we're able to select both sides and besides that we can able to extend to the pattern outline or extend to internal lines so right now it's easy and more quickly to add multiple internal lines on both sides at the same time so there's also some improvements for walk pattern two right now you use walk pen tool can traverse pattern edges or multiple patterns and you can now click to match up the starting points hover over symbolize to continue walking a pattern across multiple pattern pieces such as these jackets and same time right click at any point while walking to flip the pattern horizontally so for auto sewings in the p36.0 version we saw the introduction of the auto sewing features now these functions has been expanded into 6.1 including more categories such as pens so in this virtual file we arrange or we need to arrange the pattern pieces around the aperture in order the way they would be sewn so i just quickly used arrangement point to arrange the pants patterns and next please select auto sewing tool and now there's uh the select option had newly added with pens so and then sewing will automatically be applied to the pattern pieces and all you need to do is just to simulate and now here you got the simulated pants with soap so for the updates and the 3d windows now we got the 3d pen extended to the base lines as well so we can locate this uh two 3d base pen tool and point the 3d mendels and now just let me focus on these trench coat for the bottom pockets and now i just use these pens this base pen to draw a line here the base line here and also you can easily check on 2d window the same baseline appears onto the pattern as well so you can also interact with that baseline if you can trace it with the trace2 for example right now i just turn it to internal lights or you can just use it as a reference line such as this case i try to move uh the internal shapes that for the sewing around pockets now um assimilate and now i can move uh adjust the position of these web pockets there's another update for full arrangement now is it possible to fold or unfold the patterns at the same time on 3d by the full arrangement too if the patterns have symmetry properties you can activate the gizmos on the internal lines or sim line and 3d as always and move the arrow to fold and unfold the pattern such as this case i fold the cuff and you can also see that the prophecy size pattern also moves together and makes less workloads to make the fold we also have some major updates about the file saving right now we have the new functions to able to save the 3d stage under his uh as a project files so now i open the history windows and you can see uh there's a new uh option called 3d stage with the icons once you click this icon you're able to save project at the current state such as now i click one time you can able to see uh these uh instantly we've got the thumbnail image with this 3d stage named underneath is now saved for the current 3d stage um and now that's you can continue to work on to change different ways of the project files let's say now i change the pose of this avatar and maybe i also switch to another viewing angle such as now i save these uh as another 3d stage files and you can able to see this uh once you click it you will save a separate 3d state files and showcasing under the history windows and now on even you i still continue to work on let's say switching the top color to another such as like this blue color and i'll also click the stack uh the saves 3d stage icon again you got the third 3d stage file so um these uh you can always uh able to check how keep staving the current 3d stage uh numbers 3d stage while you're working on to the project files and this function as a full project can be added back to the current workspace or open as a new project so let's say right now i go i select a 3d stage one that i just initially saved   right click upon the select the 3d stage you can able to select add to workspace of course you can delete or rename it now if i add the select free stage 3d stage 1 you there's also a problem when you're asking you are you sure of course and now i just try to add on 3d stage 1. then these um projects will switch to the 3d stage 1 status but the same time the history that under that you say behind will also uh with all the other assets in included and also the 3d stage in history they can be accessed there once you open the 3d stage you can locate back under files reasons or you can also undersafe as projects now we can also able to export gi gltf file with colorways and animations so um we have a file ready uh now with multiple colorways if you go to check um under the color weights mode you can able to see there's multiple colorways added and you can also go to animations if you're able to see there's also animations files set for these portal files so now uh let's go back and go to file export now select grtf save file or of course you name it test jrtf so for the pop-up window please make sure to select file save colorways as well as the included garment animation for under objects so these two if you want to export these two information please make sure you check the box there and click ok so now you can re-import the gltf files and to clone in 6.1 versions we are now able to open substance file including clone physical properties we can select fabrics and change material to substance and express different fabric appearance in the meanwhile we can also apply co-physical properties into the substance such as now i play with different presets under clone preset library for fabric so we can now combine able to combine the substance materials both physical and textured and also you can also apply substance to the materials files such as buttons or the avatars so we can also can preview the results in the render window right now so in this case you can see the substance showcased onto the these uh door this girl door baby door's dressed we can do some settings such as changing the displacement map value to make the material appearance get closer to your designs of your results besides that we can also apply substitute materials such as the dog avatar when we refresh the red window we can see the changes on these dots after we can also apply it onto the buttons for showing various material outcomes such as right now i zoom in a little bit about the window but that's on the bot of the buttons i switch the materials for different substance materials files and now you can able to see the changes as well on the render window so there is another improvement upon the dxf files very first is now it will be able to import 2d cad seam allowance to close seam allowance um in the scenarios now such as i open the 2d pattern windows right now i i will try to add in a dxf files that i prepared before under to choose the library so right now i add in the dxf under the window pop window now we have the extra option called convert to sim allowance uh i check this box so hit okay now of course uh in 2d pattern window we got our dxf files uh when we use the seam allowance too you can able to be automatically recognized besides the pattern outlines you got the additional lines indicating the seam allowance of course uh you're able to hit the points or the outlines pattern outlines and once you hit it you are able to still uh have the original seam allowance showcasing as a baseline in the background so please note that this default setting is applied to the type of start and or edge scene allowance that is not supported by cloud so another improvement is now we can able to load the rule files upon the dxf it can happen that name of the rule file is different from the name of the dxf we are aware of that so because of previous version chloe wouldn't have to associate rule files according to the dxf due to their different naming convention so now there is a possibility to import the rule file independently without needs of matching its name to the dxf so now here we got the dxf with the associate roof outs though there are different names but now we simply can go to under object browser the grading tab we can able to have a locate icon called open grade rule icons once you hit the icons you can able to locate the rule files independently under the open file windows so see you can able to see the different grading sites under the 2d pattern window um another way of course simple simply can just drag and drop the rule files under the library so you can able to have the same showcase and then you can simply can switch to different grade size under the grading tab uh we got another update on to the 3d snapshots uh first is we can adjust the resolution for pixels right now so you see under these z project files we got the this two backs displayed with the background um now we can able to adjust the resolutions right so we let's go to the files under the snapshot 3d windows i just type in the names first now under the snapshot windows image size settings we can able to see uh now the units and the resolutions is able to change the values so um now it's 72 but of course we can adjust into other units such as engines millimeters centimeters as you prefer so um now stick with pixels we can able to adjust the resolution let's say now is in 300s so you can able now you can able to export the 3d snapshots in custom resolutions another update is about you can able to show high to 3d grids under 3d windows so you can see under the toggle bars the bottom there's icons you can able to locate these 3d grids display and the same time when you open the 3d snapshots for exporting the 3d snapshot image you can also able to showcase displays these 3d grids according to your 3d snapshots um another improvement is that we can able to set the rotation axis of turntable um so now in this z project files we got the two backs displayed with the backgrounds let's go to files video capture turn tables under the windows options now you can able to see these rotation access under rotation axis this is opto as a default settings but of course of course now it's indicated by the dot lines at the centers as a assets is like rotation axis so if i select the custom options such as now enter a specific value for the x and y and z axis uh this value now is able to adjust right to change right now so once i insert values it's automatically changed to customs exits and you will instantly see the indicated dot lines of the rotation axis switch to the right sides right now i adjust the z value so another improvement is if you hide one avatar and the garments and set the rotation to octo we will also only take into account the visible elements in the workspace so um now just hit i just hit that so you can able to see these trendable videos now adjust into the change access accordingly these also can be able to do it under the render window for image properties timetable image now switch to the video capture and record the turntable videos um in the video settings we can adjust the rotation access still by octo center customs and preview in the 3d render right so in 6.1 a new video saving formats is able to provide it which is mp4 so user can save turntable and animation video as mp4 or avi format depending on os mount so in this case i save this video and select this mp4 for avi formats thank you so much for joining us in cloud 6.1 webinar we will have few more new features to showcase so please stay tuned and subscribe our channels to see more updates you ",

        "Transcript": "in this video we are going to go through changing an avatar size to one of our standard astm sizes along with changing and adjusting the avatar pose so i'm first going to start by going into our avatar folder right here in our library i can double click and i'm going to open up all of my avatar options so we have two female options a kid and two fam male options i'm going to go to my female version 2 and i'm just double clicking to enter each new folder here i'm going to double click to open up fifi once fifi has opened up i can now start to adjust and change her pose if i want to i can also start to adjust and change her size so if i want to adjust her size i can go into my size folder right here in version 2 and here i have a choice of changing her size from anywhere to missy curvy all the way to plus straight and petite as well so i'm going to go to missy straight and here i can start to change my size around as well so here i can start to change it to a straight 10 i could even change it to an eight and i'm just double clicking to adjust my size here so here i can open up a straight plus so here i'm just double clicking to get into those new sizes and to see the size change my avatar i can also go to petite and just double click to get a petite 12 or 16 or even a six i can go back to my original default by going all the way back to my sizes again and just selecting clove female tall and this is going to bring back the default if i'd like to change a pose i then just have to go all the way back to my avatar folder by either clicking this little folder with the two dots or i could just go all the way back to avatar in my library and then go to female version two and then folder pose so here i have all of these poses along with poses that i've saved as well so here i can go to pose i'm going to select pose 7. so i'm going to double click to open up this pose and a pop-up box is going to come up when changing to default poses you do want to make sure that pose only is selected along with maintain current shoe pose and align bottom to ground once these are checked i can then just hit ok and my pose is going to change automatically if i wish to further adjust this pose i can then go to my avatar in my 3d toggle menu and move over to my skeleton view so here i'm going to select my skeleton and here i can start to use these green dots to adjust and move around my avatar if you don't have your green dots on your avatar when in skeleton view that's probably because you don't have your joint selected if you don't have your joint selected you won't see your green dots and you'll see just your skeleton this is going to allow you to move each and every joint around it also won't constraint your movement at all so if i decide to move this arm back it will not stop me it also won't adjust any other part of my body at all when i'm just moving this joint that's going to be a little bit different when using when having this selected if i select this green dot and decide to move my arm back my whole body is going to start moving that's because if i was moving this arm back in real life her whole body would have to adjust to have this pose realistic if i wanted to adjust my pose and also see the avatar not in the skeleton i would just have to hit shift x and now i would just see my regular avatar pose and i can continue to adjust my arm and move this around now i need to make sure that my joint is selected while i'm switching back to each view so if i hit shift x i'll have this if i don't have anything selected and i hit shift x i won't be able to adjust my avatar at all i'm going to go back to my avatar and skeleton and here i can keep on moving and adjusting my arm again i can switch views by going into shift x and moving her around i can also adjust how my torso is going so i can bend all the way over all the way back and all of that i can also start to move out my knees if i wanted to and moving my leg and again this is always going to move my body while i move each joint so that it stays realistic here i can hit shift x and now i have a whole new pose if i like this pose i can then go to file save as pose and again it's file save as pose and then i can save this and just hit save now let's say i was just moving around every single joint i didn't have any of that constraint on at all and i was moving her elbow around and up and i wanted to switch this pose out to pose five pose here i'm going to select pose five by double clicking if i have pose only selected it will only change the pose not this shoulder here so here i'm going to hit okay and as you can see the shoulder is still out of whack so i'm going to hit control z and here i'm going to double click those five and this is when i would select pose and joint so here i'm going to select this and hit ok and now my shoulder's back in the correct position it should be and i can just continue to play around and adjust my pose and skeleton as i see fit once i'm all set i can then again just hit file save as pose now if i get the right size that i want so if i change my size of my avatar as well to maybe a petite straight six and i liked this whole avatar i could then go to file save as avatar and now i'll have this avatar saved exactly in this pose and in this size as well and that's basically all there is to it i hope you enjoyed the video thanks for watching you ",
        "Summary": "# Comprehensive Guide to Changing Avatar Size and Pose This guide will provide you with step-by-step instructions for changing the size and pose of an avatar, as detailed in the provided transcript. It includes definitions, tips, and tricks to make the process smoother. ## **Definitions** - **Avatar**: A digital representation of a user, often customizable in terms of size, pose, and appearance. - **ASTM Sizes**: Standard sizes defined by ASTM International, which can include categories like Missy, Curvy, Plus, Straight, Petite, etc. - **Pose**: The position in which the avatar is displayed, which can be adjusted for realism and style. - **Skeleton View**: A mode that shows the underlying structure of the avatar, allowing for more detailed adjustments. ## **Step-by-Step Instructions** ### **1. Opening the Avatar Library** 1. **Locate the Avatar Folder**: - Find the avatar folder in your library. - Double-click to open it and view available avatars. ### **2. Selecting Your Avatar** 1. **Choose an Avatar**: - Navigate through the folders to find your desired avatar (e.g., Female Version 2). - Double-click to enter the folder and select your avatar (e.g., \"fifi\"). ### **3. Adjusting Avatar Size** 1. **Navigate to Size Folder**: - Find the \"Size\" folder within your avatar version. - Double-click to explore size options. 2. **Select Desired Size**: - Choose from available sizes such as \"Missy,\" \"Curvy,\" \"Plus,\" \"Straight,\" and \"Petite.\" - For example, select \"Missy Straight.\" - Double-click to change the size (e.g., Straight 10, 8, etc.). 3. **Revert to Default Size**: - To revert to the original size, navigate back to the size options and select \"Clove Female Tall.\" ### **4. Changing Avatar Pose** 1. **Access Pose Folder**: - Return to the main avatar folder. - Navigate to the \"Pose\" folder to view available poses. 2. **Select a Pose**: - Choose a pose (e.g., Pose 7) by double-clicking on it. - Ensure the following options are selected in the pop-up: - \"Pose Only\" - \"Maintain Current Shoe Pose\" - \"Align Bottom to Ground\" - Click \"OK\" to apply the new pose. ### **5. Fine-Tuning the Pose in Skeleton View** 1. **Enter Skeleton View**: - Access the 3D toggle menu and select the skeleton view. - Choose the skeleton and observe the green dots that represent joints. 2. **Adjust Joints**: - Select a joint (e.g., arm) using the green dot to move it. - Remember, if the joint is not selected, the green dots won’t appear. 3. **Switch Views**: - Use **Shift + X** to toggle between skeleton view and regular avatar view. - Ensure the joint is selected for adjustments while switching views. 4. **Make Adjustments**: - Continue adjusting other joints (e.g., torso, knees) as required. - Maintain realistic movements; moving one joint may necessitate adjustments to others. ### **6. Saving Your Pose** 1. **Save Pose**: - Once satisfied with your adjustments, go to **File > Save As Pose**. - Confirm the save to keep this new pose. ### **7. Changing Pose with Joint Adjustments** 1. **Select Another Pose**: - If you want to switch to another pose (e.g., Pose 5), double-click it. - If \"Pose Only\" is selected, only the pose will change, potentially misaligning joints (e.g., shoulder). 2. **Adjust with Joint**: - To maintain joint positions, select \"Pose and Joint\" before applying the new pose. - Click \"OK\" to ensure all joints adjust accordingly. ### **8. Saving Avatar with Size and Pose** 1. **Finalizing Avatar**: - If you’ve adjusted size (e.g., Petite Straight 6) and pose to your satisfaction, go to **File > Save As Avatar**. - Confirm the save, which will retain both the size and pose settings. ## **Tips and Tricks** - **Undo Actions**: If you make a mistake, use **Ctrl + Z** to undo your last action. - **Realistic Adjustments**: Always consider how moving one joint affects the entire pose; aim for realism in movements. - **Save Frequently**: Regularly save your work to avoid losing changes. - **Explore Options**: Feel free to experiment with different sizes and poses to find what best suits your needs. - **Use Skeleton View Wisely**: This view is useful for detailed adjustments; ensure you select the correct joint to see the green dots. By following these instructions, you should be able to effectively change the size and pose of your avatar while maintaining a realistic appearance. Enjoy customizing your avatar!"

divided into different work rooms so the style i was asked for is a top that means i can go here into tops and here i will go into the style that has been uploaded as a blank style and as soon as you got the style open you can look here on the top right corner under attachment to find everything that comes with this style attached here like dxf and pdf so by clicking on the icon for attachment you can see that two files have been uploaded like this so i will simply download both of the files and then we can start with the actual work to download i will click on the three little dots next to my dxf file then click on download itself and in the meantime i can hover over my pdf click on it and get a preview this way i can check it's a women's knitted top with a v-neck so i downloaded now the pdf and pattern file that i received and can now continue by starting working on the garmin itself as soon as i have then clo open which you can see here i can either add everything to the library with a folder or go to file and click on import so here i can select the dxf pattern directly that i want to work on and now work from there if i simply double click on it i'll get up my add dxf window can also drag and drop it over and here i just make sure to choose the right settings for example swap the cutting line with the sewing line in order to get the correct outline optimize all curve points and then click ok so my dxf pattern gets loaded into my pattern window and in the next step i will bring in an avatar from my library if i'm quickly checking at my pdf i can see here that there was even a given name of the avatar so i make sure i get the right one so here the claw avatar usastm missy straight 2 is stated to be used this means i will go to my clo library and load the size so to load the avatar just select the avatar in the library here on the left side go into the avatar menu to female version 2 and then select one of the avatars whichever you prefer can add it by double clicking and once i have this i can go into my size folders and enter here the according fit menu so here i'm looking for missy straight which would be this one double clicking also here and then simply make sure i add size number two and i can do so by also simply double clicking on the abs file this way the size of my avatar changes automatically so then i can close my library and start the work on the actual garment for an efficient workflow in khloe it can be really useful to use the function of symmetrical pattern pieces so i would have to delete half of my patterns and then later on apply this function symmetric pattern with sewing so i go ahead by selecting the pattern pieces that can be made symmetrical and delete half of them also this one and then i can just create a symmetrical copy but before i do this i sew together first what i already can sew here i choose the free sewing tool and then for example connect the side seams here just by clicking once to start and once to end the sewing line do the same on the other side and then go ahead closing all seams that i can already close including the sleeve and the armhole here so here i will go and sew notch by notch first attaching the notch from the armpit to the front so in order to stick to the instructions that i got with my pattern i ignore the blue dot and just push the sewing line to each notch to stretch out the sleeve accordingly as the pattern requires go around the whole way until the complete sleeve is added then to continue the work on this leaf i will connect it to the cuff so i will attach the cuff first to the main sleeve by doing this with the free sewing tool again so it can ease in the sewing line accordingly and because later on the cuff will have to get folded in i will now have to sew it on also onto each other that means this one here will be my fold line and i need to connect the side onto the other part so i then can connect the top to the hem and the side seam to the other side seam and because this cuff will get folded we also need to sew this up and activate this baseline here i use the trace tool to do so because this baseline right now is inactive and when we activate it it will become an internal line so i just click on it with the trace to press enter and then i can use the free sewing tool to connect the side seams where it will get folded onto each other just like this here i need to make sure my sewing line notches which indicate my direction are facing each other that later on when the seams are laying flat on top of each other they also won't get reversed also in case of overlapping sewing lines don't forget to change the sewing line type to be turned so clone knows to simulate it flat just as explained here when you simulate with a custom angle the software will put the pattern pieces next to each other which is causing this gap in case they are laying actually on top of each other so you need to set the sewing line type in the property editor to be turned once this is set the simulation will then know to simulate these pattern pieces laying flat on top of each other without this gap here where the seam is now just repeat the same process on the other side of the little cuff just make sure the sewing line notches also face each other for the direction and set the sewing line type in the property editor to be turned for this one as well as the next step i will then have to connect the layers with itself also here i set the property editor to be turned and then i just have to attach this side seam of the cuff to the other side seam of the cuff and if i start doing this with the free sewing tool along the whole side seam you will see that i get a notification that seam lines are overlapping so i can just click ok here because i need to take in consideration that i can only sew one part onto each other so i'll go for this one the one on top just choose the free sewing tool here leave the sewing line type as it is and then i have connected my whole cuff to this leaf so before we will attach the neck and the hem we will just duplicate one side with symmetrical editing which here i make my selection right mouse click and then select symmetric pattern with sewing i could also perfectly use the shortcut ctrl d then place the copy next to my pattern that i already have simply aligning it here a little bit and this way i also don't have to redo the sewing i just need to finish the sewing at the center back and the center front because so far i didn't do it yet just like this here i'm using the free sewing tool as well to be quick and then in the next part i can attach the neck and the hem first of all i will start by connecting this pattern piece here to my neck to have a better overview where i want to sew i will also re-manage my layout just bring this closer so i can see okay this bit here will be my center front and then i can go from there and attach it around the whole neckline and to have the sewing a bit more easy i will first of all cut one half of this pattern piece away so i can delete it and then unfold it symmetrically i will do so with the trace tool just select the baseline at the center right mouse click and click cut then change to transform pattern tool delete one side and with the edit pattern to a right mouse click on the center front and then choose unfold symmetric editing with linked sewing this way i will only have to sew one side and don't have to worry about the other one because it will get copied automatically to sew it on i will choose the free sewing tool up from my menu bar or shortcut m just like this and then i start from the center front to the first notch also here make sure to ignore the blue point this time because you want the pattern piece to get stretched out according to the notches and also here you can see perfectly how it's getting copied on the other side and then i just continue on the right hand side as one from the front to the shoulder seam and then from the shoulder seam back towards the back on the other side here i have to pan over to my back pattern continue also here make sure to continue from the right hand side as worn to the notch and then finish the last bit here as well on the pattern piece once it's attached to the body you can also see on the pattern piece itself that the neckband has a baseline that i will again using the trace tool and hitting enter convert into an internal line so i can later fold it over and also i have to make sure to connect the side seams here onto each other and again set the sewing line type to be turned before i attach it and sew it together in the center back now i can also attach the pattern piece where it folds over seem to seem same process here i have to set the sewing line type to be turned and now i can attach the hem around the body piece also here i have to sew the side lines and to attach it to the body so first i will attach it step by step this time i'm using the segment sewing tool for it i just go one way around starting at the right hand side and then you can see here it also with the arrows just stick to one direction and it will wrap around later on perfectly then i connect the side lines again to each other and use the trace tool to turn the center baseline into an internal line so it can fold over now with the segment sewing tool i also connect the side seams here with each other set the sewing line type to be turned and then also connect the side seam from one side to the other side once this is done i can sew the folded part on top of each other and also here set the sewing line type to be turned and just because i forgot it earlier i can also now connect the center back of the neck pattern piece with each other so then i'm finally done with my whole sewing and can continue with the arrangement around my avatar because we have sewn everything already well together i can now make my 3d window a little bit bigger so i can see everything better and i will first of all use the reset 2d arrangement button to also reset my 2d layout just for better orientation if i click here you can see how it's mirroring the layout from the 2d pattern window to the 3d window and then i turn on my arrangement points either in the toggle bar on the left side or by using shift f and because all my pattern pieces are hiding my avatar right now i would have a hard time to reach all my arrangement points i select all pattern pieces with ctrl a move them upwards and if i now zoom in i have a clear view on all arrangement points and i can select the pattern pieces by selecting them directly in the 2d window so just click on one because they are symmetrical it will automatically place it on the other side as soon as you hover over just as you can see here you get this preview of these gray ghosts and if you click on an arrangement points you have directly placed the pattern piece i also have to make sure when i'm placing my sleeve to pick the correct side so just pay attention to the sides and then hover over and pick one of the arrangement points on top of the arm same applies for the cuff just make sure you place it next to this leaf and then just make sure you select one of the arrangement points for the waist so here you can then rearrange this pattern piece the arrangement points just give a rough placement and then you can have this pattern be selected hover over to the property editor and under arrangement if you scroll down you can modify the position on the y-axis you can modify the offset so it will be a bit less curved and you can also modify the arrangement on position x if you would like to in this case we are fine for the neck i also just pick one of the arrangement points see if it's opening at the back and then also here i'm simply tweaking the offset so it will be a bit more open for a smooth simulation and then i can turn off my arrangement points again in the avatar display of my toggle bar on the left and then check if i have sewn everything correctly here i can also check my garment view display also in the little toggle bar on the left if you hover over the little garment here you can see several settings this time i will turn on the sewing threads say show threads as soon as i do so i will see all my sewing in colorful lines so i can check if i have reversed sewing anywhere this time it looks good and then i can continue folding my cuffs and my hem here i will use these internal lines if i click on it in 2d you will see it's there in 3d as well with the fold arrangement tool you can hover over this pattern piece click on this line then a folding gizmo appears and you can use it to fold your pattern piece manually over so later on it will get sewn correctly if you ever want to check these internal lines you can also turn them on in the garment view display same for the cuff here you can see them now very clearly and use again the fold arrangement tool to fold these cuffs up and then as a last pattern piece i can do the same for the hem down here then choose my select move tool rearrange the pattern pieces a little bit so it won't cause too much intersection when simulating and then if i go around i see everything looks correct no seams look reversed you would see directly when the threads looked crossed also looking at the neck the hem and the cuffs all of these pattern pieces are double layered and if i don't tweak my particle distance a little bit the left fabric side of the inside would poke through the outside so i can just make here sure that i also modify my mesh just turning this on in the mesh view of my toggle bar to show you the difference so if i change back to textured surface i have still the pattern pieces selected go to simulation properties in the property editor and set the particle distance value down already to 10 to prevent intersection when i simulate once all these settings are completed i can then finally simulate by hitting the space bar and if i rotate around my avatar everything looks fine and my garment itself is completed one last thing i would like to do is here to merge the center front and the center back seam so here i'm choosing the edit pattern tool and if i just simply click on one of the center back or center front segments here right mouse click and select merge you can see i'll get this information window it won't work so i have to make sure i select the complete center front seam here then right mouse click try merge again and this time it worked then i simply need to repeat the same process on the center back and it's also copying the symmetry on these merge pattern pieces which you can see on the dotted line in the middle and if you then simulate you have now one complete pattern piece at the front and at the back in the next step i would like to change the pose of my avatar so i make sure i enter the avatar folder in my library the female one and then go to pose here i can select from a pose that i want this time i double click on the attention pose simply press ok here and then my avatar already automatically starts simulating until it's reached the post that i want simulation here will stop automatically as well i can do a little rearrangement manually and then for a better quality i will also set the resolution higher which means i will have to reduce the particle distance so i make my mesh smaller i select my complete pattern enter a particle distance of 5 and then simulate and then you can also see a difference in the resolution of the garment itself once everything is finished i will take a look at my technical sheet which states i have to use a knit area of 100 cotton and also these colors here with pantone color codes accordingly and then going back to khloe i will make sure to find the cording material first here i enter my library go into my fabric folder there are 50 base fabrics i will have a look in order to find knit terry and if i hover over i always see more information this one looks right like it has 100 percent cotton so i can just drag it over onto my fabric number one in the object browser and then like this i can automatically assign this knit terry with 100 cotton to my complete garment also to get the simulation more correct i'll simulate again now it's changing according to the physics of this fabric here in the object browser that i just applied and once this is completed i will then stop the simulation and take again a look at the details which has also changed because of the new material if i look at my fold lines here it's still a bit sharp so i first turn off the internal lines in my view menu and then i see it still doesn't look very soft and nice so i pick the edit pattern tool select all these internal lines i have to zoom in a bit more so i can select them precisely i can select them all at once and then take a look at the fold menu in the property editor first of all i will reduce the fold angle even more to 10 and then i turn off the option of fold rendering if i then simulate again i will see how these edges don't look as sharp anymore and everything will look nice and smooth if i then want to enhance the quality of my overall garment i stop the simulation and i can use the high resolution button in my 3d menu which you will find up there in the menu bar simply click on hi-res garment which means high resolution garment here information window pops up where you can set the particle distance for the garment overall usually the particle distance is set to a default value of 20. once we want to improve the quality we will usually set it down to 5. we could even set it lower but in this case we will type in a value of 5 and then every pattern piece which is in a tolerance between 5 and 20 default particle distance will get affected also i can change the additional thickness collision value which is as default set to 2.5 here it will get reduced to one millimeter of thickness collision which will allow the pattern pieces to lay more flat on top of each other as well as the avatar skin offset will also get reduced to zero in this case this will also reduce the gap between the garment and the avatar itself you can always reverse this process under choosing low resolution properties under the same menu in the 3d menu bar up on the top in this case we will then press ok and simulate again and as soon as i do so you will also see that the little arrow on the top left corner of the 3d menu turns into a double arrow so when i simulate now it means it's simulating under high resolution and also takes a bit longer to finish the whole simulation for the garment you will also see it's turned into red this is also how you can recognize under which simulation you're currently working and the garment itself will develop in stages and once you have the feeling it's done you can stop the simulation simply click again wait a second until it's off and when we rotate now we can see how smooth and soft the fabric looks now once this is done we can now take a look at the colors we saw in the technical sheet to do this a bit more easily i will use the colorway editor colorway editor is up here under simulation i simply go to the drop down menu open my colorway editor and here i can see that the fabric that i have currently applied has already a color i can also simply desaturate it so i click on it in the object browser go to texture in my property editor then i can tick on the box for desaturation which literally means it's taking the color from my texture away but the material remains just like this you can see it also here directly in the 3d window and now i can change the color by going directly to the color tab and also here in my integrated pantone library i can either pick colors a bit more random as i want to but i can also type in the color codes from the sheet directly that i have down here and then enter them into the color menu to find the exact same colors as stated on my technical sheet the easiest way to get the number would be to copy and paste so i select my first color simply press ctrl c so later on i can paste it in my color menu here in khloe right here is the box for it i simply paste it and as soon as i hit the icon the color comes up so i can simply select it and click ok everything updates automatically also in my 3d window and if i want to add two more colors i can use now my colorway editor hit the little plus icon on the top right corner add in two more and name them accordingly to colorway a b and c just like this moving forward from here i can now directly select the material under the specific colorway and then click on the color menu here in the property editor type in the next color name just also copying this one from the technical sheet simply copy it paste it in here search for it select it and then click ok again and now you can see how the color on the material automatically got updated also in the 3d window one last time for the third color same process again and then here it seems like i had the wrong colorway selected so i will simply redo this process quickly on colorway c make sure i have the correct one this time look for it again add it in the color way and then say okay again this time i have now three different ones in my colorway menu and if i update on the top left button i can see now all three versions also in the little preview here when i click and switch between them 3d window is updating itself automatically and if i go back to simulation under the drop down menu i can choose in which version i want to move forward if my project contains all the information that i want to share i can then directly share it via closet via this little button up here on the right select in which file type i want to share in this case i select share project so then this page comes up takes a second to load i can say okay if this window pops up and if the upload file page pops up i can choose update an existing style select the style i want to update go and click on next also here it takes a while to upload a new file just to all the information while i'm waiting i can see here it created a new project file on the platform and here i can now also modify my view settings i can turn on and off the avatar if i don't want to see it simply here in this menu i can switch between all different color ways because this information was already included in my project file the next stage would be the trend manager who requested this style will be checking this outfit that means this person will log in into closet and then check and comment on it in this person's account they will be able to see the same project file if i shared it with them also here under notifications they can see some updates load the project and then review it also here same ability to switch between colorways turn the avatar view on and off as well and then there's also the function to comment on this garment here they can check between the colorways and if they want to comment they can use this button on the top right corner simply draw around it and then use this post-it function if they want to make some annotations to certain points if they decide to post it and complete the person who shared this file with them will be able to see this as well once this person has completed their comments i will get a notification in my closet account and can then take a look at the annotations directly by clicking on it i will directly see there is two new annotations so i will check them by directly clicking on them here one comment requests that the length of the sleeve should be shortened to 14 inches and the second one is simply a request to show another pantone color code as well from here i take the annotations and go back into the software open up chloe again and first of all i will use the point of measure tool to find out the current length of my actual sleeve so i click once at this leaf head click at the end here where it's attached to the cuff and then click again where the cuff starts and double click at the center of this cuff pattern piece because this is folded up in the middle and then i can see here the measurements on each pattern piece before i start reducing it by the amount that was requested in order to do so i will first reverse my high resolution properties so before editing my pattern piece itself i also have to remember i need to change my resolution settings so here i click on low resolution under the hi-res garment menu and set the particle distance to 10 then click ok and the reason why i chose a value of 10 is because if you set the particle distance too high all at once it can also cause collision when simulating so it's recommended to do it step by step then i simply press the space bar in simulate and once it's simulated i stop the simulation again and can now finally start to reduce the length of my sleeve so with added pattern i grab the hem here where it's attached to the cuff move it up and right mouse click to get up my moving distance window here i type in the number i want to reduce it so 3.5 inch and then i also adjust my arrangement a little bit for a smoother simulation just put up the cuffs here manually as they are already simulated and when i simulate i also realize that these cuffs now are not wide enough because also the width of this leaf hem here changed so i just make the cuff here also a bit wider step by step i can check the width in between here if i grab and select these lines and then i just make the whole pattern piece wider simulate again to get a stable simulation and when i now look at my cuffs i also hear have some intersection it gets more visual if i change to textured surface view so here i can choose the select mesh tool up in the 3d menu bar to locate where my intersection happens so here if i hover over the pattern i see the marked green areas on my 3d garment as well like this i can easily find out which area is hidden and then click on it pull it out with the gizmo and simulate again then i'll just modify the simulation here and the arrangement by pulling slightly on my cuffs manually with my select move tool with simulation on and once i'm happy with it i will then select all my patterns just checking from all sides select all patterns at once you can do this by ctrl a and then reduce the particle distance again to five you can also choose high resolution garments click ok here simulate again again here you see that my arrow is red so i'm in high resolution simulation and i will let it simulate in stages until it's done then stop the simulation again and now that i'm done with this it looks really nice and i can continue by adding in the next colorway which was also requested in this round of comments so i go again to simulation up on the right corner open the drop down menu select colorway click again on the little plus to add in colorway d and also here i just type in the name accordingly can then select the material and here again go to the property editor click on the color tab now i have to make sure i copy the right color code from my comments in closet so i can paste it in the color menu here in khloe just paste it look for the number and then i click ok when i have the color selected also will update my colorway editor preview so i can then take a closer look at all my color changes i can see them all and when i'm happy with it i can also switch between them now i go back to simulation and one last thing i want to get rid of is the point of measure as i don't need it anymore so i select my edit point measure tool hover over and select the point of measure that i set earlier to change this leaf right mouse click and delete it and once this is done i can then refine again a few settings on the parts at my garment where the cuffs for example or the hem are folded so i select all of them at once and because the particle distance is already at five i can also modify the mesh itself a bit more if you scroll down in the property editor to miscellaneous you can also change the mesh type here from triangle to quads and then if i turn on the mesh view to quickly show the effect you can see here the mesh type has changed which will also create smoother edges where the folded parts are just around here and this also just enhances the quality of the garment itself for presentation reasons so now that i'm happy with everything i will share it for a second round of comments again i will choose the share project via closet button if i click here i make sure i select share project i can click ok here i will also select upgrade an existing style this means the project i uploaded earlier will get updated you can see this also here on the left side there is also now a history of project files that you uploaded and here is now visible there is one more colorway and also this leaf measurements have changed so now the person i'm collaborating with on this garment can comment on this as well if i want to continue also get my garment ready for presentation i can create render images that means a photorealistic image of my garment this time i will create render images without my avatar so i go to the toggle menu and deselect show avatar i can also press shift a on my keyboard and if i now start the interactive render preview in my render window i will get an immediate preview of my 3d area so here you can see as i move my garment around it also changes and if i select image video properties i can adjust the size of my image i can also select where i want to save it if i tweak the image size here i can also type in a different width for pixels so now i have the square image size and i can also modify the background for example you can see here i can place it as i want if i want to get rid of the white in the color background i can also tick on this little box for transparency so you can see the background is now transparent and i can now create custom views with a right mouse click in the 3d window i can screenshot the current view and if i rotate it around then adjust again the garment in the image also with help of my render preview click on the little camera icon again to take a snapshot of this view rotate it around take another one and then create another custom view of my back view as soon as i do this i can switch between the saved snapshots for my custom views and i can then select them in my property editor under image and video properties to make sure that all of them can get rendered at once so here under image video viewpoint you can select custom views which means later on everything will get rendered at the same time and i don't have to create the render separately i can also select render all colorways and have that transparency selected also here under file name i can set it to be named for the project name or type in a name that i want so then i will stop the render preview and hit the final render button to create photorealistic images with a very high resolution for also presentation reasons so the little bar on the top right of your render window also shows you how far the rendering process is and you can see how many images are already created so you can roughly estimate when your rendering process will be finished once your rendering is done you can then go back to closet and here under versions you can upload more images for your turntable so if you select turntable images here you will get this little input window where you can select the little camera icon to upload these four rendered images to create a turntable for colorway one so here if you click on it you can select all four of them say okay add in another colorway do the same for this one just add in all four images and if you then select upload it will create small turntable videos that can also be used for presentation reasons just press play here you can also switch between the colorways and this would then be for example the end of a workflow from beginning to end to share with the collaborator also via closet you ",
        "Summary": "# Comprehensive Guide to OEM Workflow in CLO This guide will walk you through the OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturing) workflow in CLO (the 3D garment design software), detailing step-by-step instructions, definitions, and tips and tricks based on the provided transcript. ## Overview of the Process 1. **Setting Up**: Log into CLO and access the necessary workrooms and styles. 2. **Downloading Files**: Obtain and review the required files (DXF and PDF). 3. **Creating the Garment**: Use CLO to design and simulate the garment. 4. **Finalizing the Design**: Adjust for any collaboration feedback and render the garment. 5. **Sharing**: Share your project with collaborators via CLO. ### Step-by-Step Instructions --- ### Step 1: Setting Up 1. **Log into CLO**: - Open your CLO application. - Enter your credentials to log in. 2. **Access the Workroom**: - Navigate to the \"workroom\" section. - Select the desired season of the brand (e.g., \"Sunday\"). 3. **Select the Style**: - Click on the category (e.g., \"tops\") to browse available styles. - Open the blank style you need to work on. ### Step 2: Downloading Files 1. **Locate Attachments**: - In the top right corner, find the “attachments” section. - Click on the attachment icon to view files like DXF and PDF. 2. **Download Files**: - Click on the three dots next to the DXF file and select “download”. - Open the PDF file to preview the style specifications (e.g., “women's knitted top with a v-neck”). ### Step 3: Creating the Garment 1. **Importing the DXF File**: - Open CLO and create a new project. - Navigate to `File` → `Import` and select your downloaded DXF file. - In the \"Add DXF\" window, ensure proper settings (e.g., \"swap cutting line with sewing line\"). 2. **Adding an Avatar**: - From the CLO library, select an avatar. Make sure to choose the correct size (e.g., \"Missy Straight 2\"). - Double-click to load the avatar. 3. **Setting Up Symmetrical Patterns**: - Select half of the pattern pieces to delete and apply the \"Symmetrical Pattern with Sewing\" function. 4. **Sewing the Garment**: - Use the **free sewing tool** to connect side seams and other areas (e.g., cuffs, neck). - Make sure your sewing lines face the correct direction (notches should align). 5. **Folding and Finishing Details**: - Use the **trace tool** to activate internal lines for folds. - Adjust the sewing line type to \"turned\" for seams that overlap. 6. **Simulating the Garment**: - Once all pieces are connected, simulate the garment by pressing the spacebar. - Adjust any patterns as necessary for a smooth simulation. ### Step 4: Finalizing the Design 1. **Tweaking the Design**: - Modify the garment properties (e.g., particle distance) for clarity and smoothness. - Simulate again to check the appearance. 2. **Applying Fabrics and Colors**: - Enter the fabric library and select the appropriate material (e.g., \"Knit Terry\"). - Apply it to the garment and simulate to see changes. 3. **Editing Colors**: - Use the **Colorway Editor** to manage fabric colors based on the technical sheet. - Paste Pantone color codes as needed. 4. **Preparing for Presentation**: - Render high-resolution images of the garment without the avatar for cleaner visuals. - Set up a turntable for showcasing the garment from different angles. ### Step 5: Sharing the Project 1. **Sharing via CLO**: - Click on “Share Project” in the upper right corner. - Select the option to update an existing style or create a new one. - Collaborators can access the project and provide feedback. 2. **Receiving Feedback**: - Check for annotations or comments from collaborators in your CLO account. - Make necessary adjustments based on feedback received. 3. **Finalizing Adjustments**: - Use the point of measure tool to check any required dimensions. - Adjust patterns and colors as needed based on feedback. 4. **Final Rendering**: - Upon completion, render high-quality images and turntable videos for presentation. - Upload images to CLO for sharing with collaborators. ### Tips and Tricks - **Use Keyboard Shortcuts**: Familiarize yourself with shortcuts (e.g., Ctrl+D for symmetrical editing) to speed up your workflow. - **Regularly Save Your Work**: Save your project frequently to avoid losing progress. - **Utilize the Library**: Make full use of the avatar and fabric libraries to find the right components quickly. - **Check the Garment View Display**: Always verify sewing lines and fabric properties before simulation. - **Adjust Particle Distance Wisely**: Gradually reduce the particle distance for smoother simulations. With the above steps and tips, you should be well-equipped to navigate the OEM workflow in CLO successfully. Happy designing!"

        "Transcript": "hello everyone and welcome to another clue video in this video we are going to be learning how to do smoking in khloe there are going to be two types of smoking that i will show you over here we will have a basic smoking and then a smocking using the clothe tag tool so let's get into it so the first thing you need to do is load in the files that is the pattern files that you will find you can download them from the description of the youtube video and i have already loaded them in here in my library so i'm just going to double click on the file here that is the dxf file and you'll get in this box that says import txf in this you can keep the option load type as open and you can set the settings according to them here now that we have all our patterns we're going to go in and add in an avatar so these patterns are for a woman so we're gonna add either of our female avatars and i'm gonna go ahead and add in grace over here so a simple double click and you'll see my avatar is added into my workspace now one thing to notice is these patterns are white on the front and the back so it is a little difficult in the 3d window to make out which is the right side of the fabric and the wrong side so to adjust that what we're going to do is we're going to go here in our toggle menu and we're going to select textured surface once we select that you will see now when you rotate the back side of your fabric that is the wrong side of your fabric is gray color once this is done let's go ahead into sewing just a quick reminder that in chloe i would always set my patterns in this manner with the back and front on either sides of the sleeve and the other side of the patterns can be duplicated with the option of symmetric pattern so now we're going to go ahead into the sewing the first thing i'm going to do is sew the side seam parts and i'm going to use the free sewing tool for this as you can see in this section you will notice that both the segments are not equal and this is because this part will be the smocked part which is why you can see the few baselines on it as well if i go ahead and use the edit sewing tool and delete the sewing and i go back into it again you can see that there will be a blue dot telling me the end of the sewing but for now we're going to do it till here because we have smoking go ahead and complete the other side seam and once this is done we're gonna go now into the side seam of the sleeve there we go now we have the front these sections over here in the front and here again we have a slight sort of sharing happening so there will be a little bit of a difference in the sewing lines as well going ahead and completing the back and once this is done we're going to move on to the shoulders so in the shoulders just remember you have to begin from one side and use that as a guide for the other so young beginning from the neck towards the shoulder and the same thing over here this will make sure my sewing lines aren't entangled now for the sleeve gap so over here you have all of these notch points and what i'm going to do is follow these notch points exactly so you stop at the notch point and when i'm going to the sleeve you can see i have my blue dot available now i'm done with the front and i'm going to do the same on the back so starting from here and i have the dark blue dot that tells me that my sewing line is complete and there we go now we're going to go ahead and duplicate all of these patterns to the other side so select all of them right click and you have the option symmetric pattern with sewing now i have my pattern and i'm just going to move the back to the other side and once that's done we have the center front and the center back so using my segment sewing tool just going ahead and quickly completing that there we go we have all the patterns sewn now let's go on to arranging the patterns in the 3d window i'm going to increase the size of the 3d window and to make sure the patterns resemble the 2d window in the 3d window i'm going to select this option called reset 2d arrangement and then i'm going to switch on the arrangement points over here once these arrangement points are switched on you'll see i will be able to pick each and every pattern and arrange them but to do that first i'm pressing ctrl and a selecting all the patterns and moving them up with the gizmo tool now what i'm going to do is i'm going to select the pattern from the 2d window and you can see it'll automatically get selected in the 3d window and i'm going to start arranging these patterns also note that since these patterns are symmetrical whenever i select one pattern to arrange it the other one will automatically get arranged on its side so here i'm selecting the front and you can see the shadow of two patterns and when i click you can see both of them are arranged just arranging all the front patterns and once this is done i'm pressing the number key 8 to get the back view and going ahead and arranging all the back patterns over here you can see that since these patterns are quite large they are overlapping each other a lot and to avoid the overlapping that will happen or the collision that will happen during simulation i'm selecting these patterns and in the property editor i'm going to change the way the arrangement has been set so over here you can see there is position x y and offset so i'm going to change the position x and you can see how the pattern changes in the 3d window and i'm going to change the offset as well in this way you can see the patterns are at a safe distance from each other and this will make my simulation a lot faster and easier now we're going to go ahead and arrange the rest of the patterns again i'm changing the offset so they sit correctly once this is done i have the sleeve pattern that needs to be arranged that also will be replicated on the other side as they are symmetrical once i have all the patterns arranged we can go ahead and simulate and there we have the basic garment completed so now let's go on to actually doing the smoking part of the garment so before that i can see there is a seam here on the center front and i'm going to take off that seam and to do so we have a very easy option i'm using the edit pattern tool and i'm right clicking on this line here you can also see that since they're symmetrical when i select one line the other gets selected as well and i'm going to right click and choose the option merge as soon as i choose the option merge you'll see that this section that was two patterns will now be one single pattern although these patterns are merged even so if i try to move the point of this side the other side will move as well so this will make sure any changes you make to one side will happen to the other i'm going to go ahead and merge the other center fronts as well and then let's go ahead and do it to the back patterns as well okay once we have all the patterns merged i'm going to switch on simulation again and you will be able to see that now there are no seams on the center front or the center back you can also see that the position of my avatar has the hands in an a pose and i'm gonna go ahead and change that pose over here in the pose file just double click and you'll get that option and you can click ok once this is done you can see the avatar's hands are down and i'm going to choose the top view and just adjust the shoulder of this garment i'm simply clicking and keeping left click pressed and dragging in to adjust that now that you can see this garment i want you to pay attention to the hem and the neckline you can see that there is a binding over there we are going to create this binding in our project file right now so to do that we have the binding tool in the 3d window over here i'm just going to select it and with left clicks you create the binding and you double click to end it you can see this binding goes around the entire neckline and i'm simulating so that the binding is adjusted i'm gonna do this for the hem of the sleeve as well and in case you feel the hand of the avatar is coming in your way you can temporarily hide your avatar and complete the binding also completed for the hem of the garment and i'm going to simulate it once more just so all the binding is completely settled in case you want to edit the binding you also have the edit binding tool so ctrl a and select all the bindings and here in the property editor you have the option of type so you can set the binding to sit over or under the pattern piece once this is done you can go ahead and change the width or you can also change other details as you can see them in the property editor over here so now that we have all the bindings shown exactly how we need them to we're gonna go on to the smocking over here you can see we've done two types of smockings the one on the back is attack tool smoking and the one here on the sleeve is a smocking that we're going to use with elastics so here on the back as you can pay attention we are going to use our tack tool in cloud to create this exact type of smoggy so over here in our 3d window you can see the back pattern and your you can also see the baselines that are available here and we're going to use this as a guide for our tacky in the 3d window you will find the tag tool over here so i am selecting that tool and using these baselines as a guide you're going to use the tag tool here so you click once to start at the top of the baseline and you click to end i'm going to do the same here and complete this line vertically the process that you follow is just to click once at the start of the line and then end the tag at the end once this is done you will see the tags look something like this in the 3d window and to give you an idea of what the tacking tool exactly does i'm going to give you an example here on the sleeve so i'm tacking it once on the top and then here at the bottom and when i simulate you can see it will bring both the ends of the tacking line that i've created together to delete it you just need to use the edit tag tool select the line from the 2d window or 3d window and press delete right click and press delete i'm also now going to change the fabric of my garments i'm using the cotton stretch velvet that is available in our glow fabric library and i'm going to change the color and you can change the color to whichever color you feel is appropriate we also have pantone integrated so i'm going to select a lighter color and i'm also changing the particle distance of this pattern piece where i'm creating the smocking on to 5 which is what it would be when it is a high resolution garment once this is done i'm going to go ahead with the second part of the tacking but as you can see i cannot see my pattern piece and bass lines clearly so i'm using monochrome surface in the 2d window from the toggle menu to be able to see it clearly now the same process that i did for the first set of lines i'm doing here in case you click wrong over here as you can see i have done you can use the edit tag tool to go ahead and adjust it to the right position okay once i have completed this line of tags all i need to do is replicate it so i'm using the edit tag tool and selecting all of them together then simply zoom into either one of them right click and copy and again right click and paste although before i go ahead and left click instead of left click i'm going to right click and when i do so i will get a pop-up box over here you can see it will show me the interval and also the number of copies that i want to create so i'm just increasing the number of copies to fit along that pattern piece once it's done you'll see you have all your tags done except for this last row which i'm going to go ahead and do manually there we go once this is done we are going to replicate that obviously to the other side of the fabric so again simple click with the edit tag tool so select all of them right click copy and right click paste once this is done and you have all your tags available i'm switching on my simulation and you can see you have a tag tool created smocking available on this back pattern once it has simulated correctly you can go ahead and switch off simulation now we're going to go ahead to create the smoking along the sleeves to do so i'm first selecting both the sleeve patterns and changing the particle distance to 5. once this is done i'm going to go ahead and simulate and let these two sleeve patterns settle down a little bit more once this is done you can see the smocking along the sleeve pattern and we are going to be using the elastic here as mentioned before so our elastic tool to create that type of smocking i'm going to first convert these baselines to internal lines so i'm using the trace tool and while keeping shift pressed i'm selecting all of them to convert them to internal lines i'm going to press enter on my keyboard once this is done you can see they have turned red in color which means they are internal lines now now i'm going to apply elastic to these lines so keeping shift pressed i'm selecting all of these internal lines and here in the property editor you'll see there will be an option for elastic and i'm going to switch this on you can also see the other values and i'm going to go ahead and change the ratio to 55 to create the smoking type that i want once this is done i'm going ahead and simulating and you'll see how the elastic will look on the sleeves now i'm just pulling out the sleeve a little bit you can also zoom into the pattern to see if the smocking looks exactly as you want it to here i can see 55 is not exactly correct so i'm going to select the internal lines and change it to 60 to get the look that i want yeah i can see the smoking and the wrinkles aren't expressed as much as i want them to so i'm going to select both the sleeve patterns and i'm changing the particle distance this time to 3. once this is done and i simulate you can see it is looking a little bit more like smoking and you can keep changing the particle distance and the elastic to get the exact type of look for the smoking that you want now we're going to go on to enhancing the quality of the garment and to do so i'm selecting all the patterns that we did not change the particle distance for and from 20 and the other values i'm going to change them to five once this is done go ahead and give it some time to simulate now you can switch off simulation and just have a look around the garment to see if there is any part of the smoking that you need to adjust to further enhance the garment i am going to use this option that is a high res option and go ahead and make the entire garment into a high resolution garment once this is done you need to simulate it again if at first when your simulation is on you don't see any change in the garment give it a minute since we have multiple different particle distances flow will take a little bit of time you'll see the quality of the garment getting better and better and once you're happy with it you can go ahead and switch off simulation and there we have our smocking completed in this video we learned how to create smocking with our tack tool as well as with creating internal lines and adding an elastic hope you all enjoyed this video you ",

        "Transcript": "hello and welcome back everybody to another tutorial of khloe today i will work on a complete outfit and show you how to express shearing on neck and sleeves first i will load the previously added file of the library from khloe i'll just click on the folder that i've added double click on the garment that i want to work on and then i close my library again to create also more space for my workflow so in the 3d window it looks like this but if you look at the pattern in 2d you can see how the garment has shearing applied to neck and shoulders you can always check it with the edit pattern tool or shortcut set so if there is a bright green line around the neckline like this just clicking on it here it means that elastic has been applied and you can check the elastic in the property editor on the right so if you click on the selected segment you will see here on the selected line that elastic is ticked on and the ratio here of 52 means that the elastic band is applied so that the length of the segment is reduced to 52 percent of its original length so when we use elastic to create an effect like this small wrinkles are created around the neckline and also here around the sleeve as you can see and this method works already pretty well but let's also learn now how to express it more into detail working with sharing we can express pattern outlines more into details because it helps us to work with particle distance so with edit pattern selected we can simply click the segment line that we want to work on in this case it's this one and once you have that line selected you can scroll down in the property editor under the menu for selected line you will find the option sharing that you can tick on which is this one here i'll just tick that box and then you can see a menu with more details pops up so here you can adjust the interval and height which is basically spacing and length the default values that are set here is one millimeter interval and the height is set to four millimeters and in the same moment that i activate sharing in my property editor it shows on the pattern piece that the sharing direction of the selected segment line is in place sharing gets expressed in 2d with this wavy line that you can see here and even if you check it in the 3d window you can see that there is a difference between the part of the garment to which the sharing function is applied and the part where it's not applied so here i just applied the shearing function to the right side of the 2d pattern so even if you check the 3d garment you can see that the wrinkles are much better on the right side compared to the left side so in order to show you what principle the sharing function is following i will turn on the mesh view in my little toggle bar on the 2d menu so you can see how it works you can find that mesh view here in the little toggle bar so i'll select show mesh and as soon as you turn the mesh view on you can see on your 2d pattern how different your mesh looks where the sharing function is applied so this function is also pretty easy to explain because it seems quite logic when you look at it where the sharing function is applied you will just reduce the particle distance immensely so you can have a much more detailed expression of the garment so since the interval of this shearing that i have selected now is one millimeter the mesh is very finely divided into one millimeter intervals just like this and can therefore create much more detailed 3d effect so this literally helps to express more details around pattern outlines on the parts where the sharing is applied in comparison to the part where sharing is not applied but you don't have to change the complete pattern to a lower particle distance yet the value one millimeter here is the maximum you cannot change it lower it will always stop with one millimeter so in case the value seems too low and the sharing too dense i can also increase the value a little bit so if i change for example the value up to a number of five sharing will be expressed in a wider interval than before and the mesh u also changes accordingly like this so i'll just lower it back to one the lowest value that i can have again and check at the same time the position where i have sharing applied in 3d window so you can see this very obvious difference in terms of detail now in the next step i will tweak the value of the height here so depending on the location where the sharing is applied there may be parts where the sharing should be shorter but there also may be parts where it should set to a bit of a higher value depending on the height of your detail that you want to express so the default value here is 40 millimeters i will change it to a higher one and it can be applied up to the maximum value of 90 millimeters in total so i'll just change that here so the same principle as for the interval if you type in a higher value it won't accept it so please keep in mind that you can't enter a higher value than 90 here and as soon as you do so your mesh view looks like this in 2d and the sharing is applied up to a height of 90 millimeters on your garment in 3d so i'll use this sharing function to express all the shearing of the neckline and also of the shoulders of this outfit i'll press shift and then click on the outline of the pattern segment lines where the sharing function should be applied and select all of them at once here i'm using the edit pattern tool as well and once i have selected them all still holding shift i can tick on sharing in the property editor for all of them at once so if you then take a look at the pattern i have also taken the values that are applied on my first line that i selected and if we now take a look at it it's applied around the whole garment everywhere where i selected the line and you can see even the details in 3d a bit more now just if you rotate around like this you can see that it's applied everywhere where i selected the lines so just keep in mind that there is a big difference in the expression of your details when you use the shearing function on wrinkles like this or when you decide to not use it so always when you work on garments that are having shearing and wrinkles around pattern outlines you should definitely use the function so my work on this garment using the sharing function would be done i hope you enjoyed the video you learned something new and see you next time you ",
        "Summary": "# Comprehensive Guide to Shearing in Garment Design with Khloe Welcome to this comprehensive guide on how to express shearing on necklines and sleeves in garment design using Khloe software. This tutorial will provide step-by-step instructions, definitions, tips, and tricks to help you achieve beautiful, detailed effects in your designs. ## Table of Contents 1. **Introduction** 2. **Loading the Garment** 3. **Understanding Shearing** 4. **Applying Shearing in Khloe** 5. **Adjusting Shearing Parameters** 6. **Using the Mesh View** 7. **Finalizing the Design** 8. **Tips and Tricks** 9. **Conclusion** --- ### 1. Introduction In this guide, we will cover the process of applying shearing to necklines and sleeves of garments using Khloe. Shearing is a sewing technique that creates small gathers or pleats in fabric, adding texture and detail. ### 2. Loading the Garment 1. **Open Khloe Software**: Launch the Khloe application on your computer. 2. **Access the Library**: Click on the folder icon to access your library. 3. **Select the Garment**: - Double-click on the garment file you wish to work on. - Close the library window to maximize your workspace. ### 3. Understanding Shearing - **Definition**: Shearing refers to the gathering of fabric, typically using elastic, to create small wrinkles or folds. It is commonly used in necklines and sleeve areas to add aesthetic appeal. - **Elastic Application**: When elastic is applied to a segment, it reduces the length of that segment to a percentage of its original length (e.g., 52% in this case). ### 4. Applying Shearing in Khloe 1. **Select the Edit Pattern Tool**: Activate the edit pattern tool or use the shortcut key (usually \"S\"). 2. **Identify the Segment**: Click on the segment line where you want to apply shearing (e.g., neckline or sleeve). 3. **Check for Elastic**: - Look for a bright green line around the neckline, indicating that elastic has been applied. - Verify the elastic settings in the Property Editor on the right side of the screen. 4. **Activate Shearing**: - In the Property Editor, find the option labeled \"Shearing\" and tick the checkbox. - This will bring up additional settings for shearing. ### 5. Adjusting Shearing Parameters 1. **Interval and Height Settings**: - **Interval**: This refers to the spacing of the shearing. The default is 1mm. You can adjust this to a maximum of 5mm if needed. - Example: Change the interval value to see how it affects the mesh and details. - **Height**: This determines the length of the shearing effect. The default is 40mm, with a maximum of 90mm. - Example: Increase the height to see more pronounced shearing effects. 2. **Select Multiple Segments**: - Hold down the Shift key and click on the outline of multiple pattern segments to select them at once. - With all desired segments selected, enable shearing in the Property Editor for all at once. ### 6. Using the Mesh View 1. **Activate Mesh View**: - Find the toggle bar in the 2D menu and select \"Show Mesh.\" 2. **Analyze the Mesh**: - Observe how the mesh changes in areas where shearing is applied. A finer mesh indicates more detail and better representation of shearing effects. ### 7. Finalizing the Design - Once you have applied the shearing to the desired areas, rotate your garment in the 3D view to inspect the overall effect. - Ensure that the shearing looks consistent and aesthetically pleasing across all segments. ### 8. Tips and Tricks - **Experiment with Settings**: Don’t hesitate to experiment with both interval and height settings to achieve the desired look. - **Use Mesh View for Precision**: Always use mesh view to evaluate how your adjustments impact the garment's detail. - **Save Your Work**: Regularly save your progress to avoid losing any changes. ### 9. Conclusion You have now learned how to effectively apply and adjust shearing on necklines and sleeves using Khloe. This technique enhances the visual appeal of your garment designs, allowing for intricate details and textures. We hope you found this tutorial helpful. Happy designing, and see you in the next tutorial!"

Open the first PSD file that corresponds to the button you want to customize. ### **Step 3: Understand the Template** - The PSD template is a flat representation of your button's surface. - It includes guidelines for logo placements, indicated by fine white outlines. ### **Step 4: Customize Your Button** 1. **Hide Template Layers:** - Hide unnecessary layers in the PSD to focus on customization. 2. **Add Custom Elements:** - **Logos:** Insert logos or prints on the button. - **Background Texture:** - Import a new background texture (e.g., marble) as a new layer. - Use a simple JPEG file for the texture. - **Brush Effects:** - Use brush tools to add effects or color to specific parts of the button. ### **Step 5: Save Your Work** 1. Save the customized file as a JPEG for realistic texturing. ### **Step 6: Create a Normal Map** 1. In Photoshop, go to: - **Filter > 3D > Generate Normal Map** 2. Adjust the **Intensity** using the blur slider to get the desired depth effect. 3. Click **OK** and save the normal map as a JPEG file. ### **Step 7: Import Textures into Your 3D Software** 1. Go back to your 3D modeling software (e.g., Chloe). 2. Navigate to the **Texture Window** and add the texture image you created. 3. Zoom in to check the new letters and brush effects. ### **Step 8: Apply the Normal Map** 1. Add the normal map you created earlier. 2. Adjust its intensity until you are satisfied with the look. ### **Step 9: Customize Button Threads** 1. Go to the **Thread Tab**: - Deactivate the **Use Same Material as Button** option. - Delete any existing textures. 2. Re-colorize the threads using a solid color. ### **Step 10: Modify Button Material** 1. In the **Button Tab**, change the material type (e.g., to plastic) for a shinier finish. 2. Adjust the **Reflection Intensity** to your liking. ### **Step 11: Adjust UV Position** 1. Change the UV position by adjusting the angle: - For example, change the angle to 5 to see the effect on the texture. 2. If you want to revert to the original position, press **Control + Z**. ### **Step 12: Inspect the Button** 1. Rotate the button to inspect branding on all sides. 2. Ensure that branding is visible inside any holes or cutouts. ## **Definitions:** - **UV Mapping:** A process of projecting a 2D image texture onto a 3D model's surface. - **Normal Map:** A texture that simulates bumps and wrinkles on the surface of a 3D model to create the illusion of depth. - **PSD Files:** Adobe Photoshop Document files that contain layers, allowing for complex image editing. ## **Tips and Tricks:** - Always keep a backup of your original PSD files before making changes. - Use high-resolution textures for better visual quality. - Experiment with different materials and settings to achieve unique looks. - Utilize layers in Photoshop efficiently; group related items for easier management. - Regularly save your work in both your 3D software and Photoshop to avoid data loss. By following these steps, you should be able to customize globe buttons effectively using UV maps, creating unique and visually appealing designs. Happy customizing!"

        "Transcript": "hi everyone thank you for watching this designer workshop i'm janine a 3d designer at cro wheelchair fashion based in munich today i would like to present the different map options you have in a workflow in khloe i would like to guide you through each map by using these different caps here so please feel free to ask questions in the live chat and we will try to answer all the questions via the chat the first map we're going to look at it is the texture map in other 3d softwares this map can be also called defuse or color map this map defines the main color as you can see here in that example of the surface of the fabric for creating a good texture map there should be no direct light for example there shouldn't be like a spotlight directly on your fabric so the lighting needs to be defused otherwise you might need to compromise the uniformity of the colors there should be also a good balance between the darkness as well as the lightness if that's not given then you might need to compensate this with additional maps and that could lead to a lower quality of the final result now let's take a look where to place the texture in chloe in order to place my first texture i have to go to the property editor in order to do that i just simply select first my fabric for my first cap and then i can see the texture tab here i have two options the first option would be going through my library to search for the right texture or i just simply drag and drop my texture in this tab here and then you can see immediately how it looks like so this is actually the most important map because this gives you a good idea of the look of your fabric then in order to make it more realistic this is the moment where the other maps come into play okay let's jump to the next map which is the normal map here i have a normal denim map and this is actually the most important map after the texture map it is also called a bump map in other 3d softwares this map will allow you to generate a subtle surface like details for instance wrinkles waves of the fabric scratches so without touching actually the mesh of the garment itself in most cases this map is purple as you can see here now let's check out what kind of effect the normal map has on our fabric first of all i will show you how the normal map looks on its own by using a blank fabric like this one here for example the way how i will apply the normal map works the same as i did with the texture so i'm going to simply select the fabric and below the texture tab i have a normal map tab here i can either search through the library or i can simply drag and drop my normal map here of course in the 3d window you can see that the purple color won't be shown because the normal map keeps the information where the structure of the fabric has some depth which means that it has the embossing look here which brings the illusion of a depth when i'm going to put for instance a number which is minus something let's do -20 you will see that now the selection is inverted one thing you should take into consideration is that this map is just the illusion it does not change the geometry of the mesh which we will later look on the displacement map i can also see when i have a look from the size that it doesn't have a geometry it's actually flat and smooth so i need to keep in mind to have a right perspective in terms of seeing my depth in the best way yes so this map is quite helpful and very usual and convenient to use the next map i'm going to demonstrate is the roughness map this map is also made of grayscale values with white black and grey sections as you can see here in my example through this map you will be able to control the light information making your fabric look more reflective or less reflective the darker tones will indicate that the material is going to be completely reflective like a mirror whereas the lighter color tones will indicate no reflection at all and though you have the options also to change the roughness intensity or using a roughness map as well i will show you how you can apply this roughness map here first of all we choose the right fabric it is no in a metal type we'd use that because we wanted to have a more pleasing look for the caps we had before but to explain that in a more clear way we're going to change this to a fabric type match the metal type would give us additional reflection which we don't like to have now let's take the roughness map here going to apply this but i have to switch to the map then i can drag and drop my map in this section here and you might not see as much but if i'm just going to change it to a more angle with the light reflection you can see the reflection on the surface but in order to make it a bit more visible i'm just going to change this to a darker color just to give it a more of a contrast of course i can also change the map intensity and the lower value allows light to be reflected in smaller areas so it actually looks highly reflective and larger values allows light to be reflected in the whole object so it looks more rough as well i can change the reflection intensity which actually increases the amount of reflection and together with the roughness map the roughness map spreads the reflected light so you can just play around with this two functionalities additionally to that i would like to show that you can also invert your selection as you know the white parts are going to be non-reflective and the dark plots are going to be reflective in some other 3d softwares it's actually the other way around in order to have it smoothly done in clo you can just simply invert your selection without changing the map in another 3d software so here you can just invert your selection and you can see that everything which is white is going to be reflective and everything which is black is going to be non-reflective so this is the easy way how you can change the map now i would like to present the displacement map this map is also called the height map in other 3d softwares this map physically displaces and tessellates the mesh of a 3d garment or fabric to which it is applied it can bring an illusion of depths of the fabric and the displacement map is made of grayscale values as you can see here so in this example for instance the darker color tone are going to represent the bottom of the fabric and the lighter color tones will represent the highest peak one thing you need to consider is that once you apply that and you'd like to see that you have to open the render engine and it takes a little bit of time to see the result because it actually needs to calculate the displaced and tessellated geometry of the mesh i will show you how that works so first of all i need to search for the right fabric i need to search for the displacement map tab which is here so it's below the texture normal map tab i can do it the same way as before going through the library or i just simply drag and drop all right now as you can see it is applied but i cannot see anything in the 3d window here this is because it needs to be open in a 3d render engine in order to see the displacement i will do this now and i will just refresh the interactive render and nothing will happen why because the depth like the highest peaks i like to have like the white colors is zero for the moment so if i would put a extreme number now let's say 10 you see how it will change accordingly but then you it's kind of like interacting with each other like the texture if i'd like to have it yeah more realistic i would need to change it slightly and then you can see the texture i mean i can also put it a little bit higher to see even more yes so this is the displacement map i will just show another example just going to drag and drop this here it will always starts from zero so i have to change that i can do another 10 to see how it looks like and also from the side you will see that you have a structure if i'm now going back to a lower value then you can also see it in that way let's jump to the next map which is the opacity map it is also called alpha and other 3d software it's like a texture mapping to define the degree of transparency translucency of areas in a given object so as you can see here it is like a grayscale image so the image actually tells you which part of the texture is going to be transparent or opaque now i would like to show how we can upload an opacity map in our alpha channel so for instance we can either use a jpeg or a png i will start with a jpeg and i need to drag and drop this image to my opacity tab here so it's below the displacement map tab so i'm just simply drag and drop or i would just go through the library function and you can see here that no everything which is black is going to be fully transparent and everything which is white is going to be opaque now let's try another one by using the png with the alpha channel i'm just doing the same way going to drag and drop it here but as you can see it doesn't looks as nice as i should be so i will need to use the alpha channel for that so i would just simply change the mode and then i can see this here as well okay let's take a look at the metalness and the metalness map in chloe when an incoming light wave hits the surface the wave is partially reflected and all the refracted light is observed so that means that the collar tint of metals comes from the reflected light so in our maps so that actually means that we don't give metals a diffuse color i will demonstrate this on a basis level here just by using the ms i'm just going to show you that now we support pbr materials in the 3d window as well as in the render so i'm just going to open it that you can see the 3d render and i'm just going to close the library to have a little bit more space now i'm going to scroll down and i will just going to push the ruler a little bit more up and you can see in the 3d window how it becomes more reflective just going to use the interactive render to see the result and now you can see we have a very reflective or like a nice metal effect here okay what else can i do it is the use of the madness map by that i will just simply use this map here and i will drag and drop this in this tab now let's take a look in the render engine as you can see here that the white section has a high value of reflection whereas the black section has a low value of reflection what else you can do or you can take into consideration you could also change the fabric type into metal but you have to take into account that it will affect the whole surface of the fabric and i'm just going to demonstrate this a little more in the render engine and you can see that it has even more a higher reflection in the white parts so the metal effect which we have here is going to superimpose our metalness map so i'm just going to keep it as fabric matte type and i'm just going to go back and change the intensity one thing you can do as well you have the ability to change the metalness map in the width and the height so the scaling you can do it by typing any measurements you like to have or you can also change this now we're getting to our last cap and i will present combination of different maps first of all i will use the texture map which is as i mentioned earlier one of the most important maps because it actually gives you a good impression on how your design is going to look like but to have a more realistic outlook it is very beneficial to use the normal map so i'm simply going to drag and drop like both together makes the surface more realistic because the normal map makes the surface of the object a little bit more bumpy or it gives you a little more of a roughness can also increase a little bit the normal map another beneficial map is the roughness map just going to drag and drop this map here it is going to be by default 50 i can for sure make it a little bit higher like the intensity of the applied map and it's also like a grayscale image which means that the white sections is going to be non-reflected whereas the black section is going to be reflective to have a more reflection in here i need to increase their intensity and you can see that in those parts here it has a higher reflection as well as you can see it in the render engine so in this case you can decide how much reflection you would like to apply now we get to our last map which is the displacement map and this map will gives you a little bit of a bumpiness now i'm going to simply drag and drop this here as well and it is also a grayscale and you can see that everything is what is going to be dark is on the button of the fabric and the claw logo will have the highest peak so let's have a look in here it doesn't change much as i have to apply amount and now you can see the little bumpiness of this claw logo i can also make it a little bit more extreme if i like to or i will keep it a little bit more flat there we go okay thank you very much know you have seen different options of the maps you can use in khloe i hope you enjoyed this designer workshop and i wish you a good user summit thank you very much ",
        "Summary": "# Comprehensive Guide to Using Maps in Clo 3D Design Welcome to the comprehensive guide on using various map options in your 3D design workflow in Clo. This guide will walk you through definitions, step-by-step instructions, and tips for optimizing your designs using texture maps, normal maps, roughness maps, displacement maps, opacity maps, metalness maps, and their combinations. ## Table of Contents 1. **Introduction** 2. **Texture Map** - Definition - Steps to Apply - Tips and Tricks 3. **Normal Map** - Definition - Steps to Apply - Tips and Tricks 4. **Roughness Map** - Definition - Steps to Apply - Tips and Tricks 5. **Displacement Map** - Definition - Steps to Apply - Tips and Tricks 6. **Opacity Map** - Definition - Steps to Apply - Tips and Tricks 7. **Metalness Map** - Definition - Steps to Apply - Tips and Tricks 8. **Combining Maps** - Steps to Combine - Tips and Tricks 9. **Conclusion** --- ### 1. Introduction In this guide, we will explore different types of maps used in Clo 3D to enhance your fabric designs. Each map serves a unique purpose in defining the look and feel of your materials. ### 2. Texture Map #### Definition The texture map (also known as diffuse or color map in other 3D software) defines the primary color of your fabric. It is critical for achieving the desired appearance. #### Steps to Apply 1. **Select Fabric**: Click on the fabric you want to apply the texture to. 2. **Open Property Editor**: Navigate to the property editor. 3. **Texture Tab**: Locate the texture tab. 4. **Add Texture**: - Option 1: Search through the library for the desired texture. - Option 2: Drag and drop your texture file into the texture tab. #### Tips and Tricks - Ensure there is no direct light on the fabric when capturing the texture. - Maintain a balance between light and dark areas for uniform color representation. - If colors appear uneven, consider using additional maps to correct the appearance. ### 3. Normal Map #### Definition The normal map (also called bump map) adds surface details like wrinkles and scratches without altering the mesh geometry. #### Steps to Apply 1. **Select Fabric**: Click on the fabric. 2. **Normal Map Tab**: Find the normal map tab below the texture tab. 3. **Add Normal Map**: - Search in the library or drag and drop the normal map into the tab. #### Tips and Tricks - Normal maps typically appear purple and do not show their color in the 3D view. - Adjust the strength (negative or positive values) to control the depth illusion. - Remember, normal maps only create an illusion of depth and do not modify the actual fabric geometry. ### 4. Roughness Map #### Definition The roughness map controls the fabric's light reflection, determining how glossy or matte the surface appears. #### Steps to Apply 1. **Select Fabric**: Choose the fabric you wish to modify. 2. **Roughness Map Tab**: Navigate to the roughness map section. 3. **Add Roughness Map**: - Drag and drop your roughness map into the tab. #### Tips and Tricks - Darker colors in the roughness map indicate high reflectivity, while lighter colors indicate matte finishes. - Adjust the roughness intensity to see its effect on the fabric's appearance. - Invert selection if needed for different effects (white = non-reflective, black = reflective). ### 5. Displacement Map #### Definition The displacement map (also known as height map) physically alters the mesh geometry to create a 3D effect based on grayscale values. #### Steps to Apply 1. **Select Fabric**: Choose the fabric for displacement. 2. **Displacement Map Tab**: Find the displacement map section. 3. **Add Displacement Map**: - Drag and drop the displacement map into the tab. #### Tips and Tricks - Open the render engine to visualize the displacement effect. - Set initial values to see the effects (e.g., start with a value of 10). - Displacement maps significantly impact render times, so be patient. ### 6. Opacity Map #### Definition The opacity map (also known as alpha map) defines the transparency levels of the fabric. #### Steps to Apply 1. **Select Fabric**: Click on the fabric you want to modify. 2. **Opacity Map Tab**: Go to the opacity map section. 3. **Add Opacity Map**: - Drag and drop your image (JPEG or PNG) into the opacity tab. #### Tips and Tricks - Use PNG files for alpha channels to achieve better transparency effects. - Black areas will be fully transparent, while white areas will be opaque. - Test different images to see how they affect the overall design. ### 7. Metalness Map #### Definition The metalness map defines how metallic or non-metallic a surface appears based on light reflection. #### Steps to Apply 1. **Select Fabric**: Select the fabric you want to modify. 2. **Metalness Map Tab**: Navigate to the metalness tab. 3. **Add Metalness Map**: - Drag and drop the metalness map into the tab. #### Tips and Tricks - Adjust the fabric type to \"metal\" for enhanced effects. - Use the interactive render to see the immediate impact of the metalness map. - Control the intensity of reflection based on the grayscale values in the metalness map. ### 8. Combining Maps #### Steps to Combine 1. **Select Fabric**: Choose the fabric to which you want to apply multiple maps. 2. **Apply Maps Sequentially**: Begin by applying the texture map, followed by the normal map, roughness map, and displacement map. 3. **Adjust Values**: Fine-tune each map's settings for optimal appearance. #### Tips and Tricks - Layering maps enhances the realism of the fabric. - Use the render engine to visualize combinations and make adjustments. - Experiment with different values to achieve unique effects. ### 9. Conclusion Using various maps in Clo 3D allows you to create detailed and realistic fabric designs. By understanding each map's function and how to apply them, you can significantly enhance your workflow and the quality of your projects. Feel free to revisit this guide as you work through your designs, and don’t hesitate to ask questions in the community for additional support. Happy designing!"

        "Transcript": "hi my name is simon and i'm a 3d designer at glow munich germany i want you to show some of the basic techniques of lighting and glow as well as give you an overview how lights actually work why is it important to learn more about lighting and practice your skills first of all lights can shape your object slash garment with a small placement of lights you get to see shadows at every wrinkle of your garment and the whole picture will have more depth and details also it's possible to draw attention to special parts of your garment you can highlight some areas because our eye always tends to look at the bright spots first on top your lighting will create an oval mood of your scene it can be gloomy and dark dramatic flawless and perfect or just represent a certain daytime or weather in general you can improve the level of details and quality of your final images a lot just with some basic knowledge about lighting therefore we need to start with the basic rules of lights to understand how they work every light has different physical properties which affect the look in our scene intensity is the most simple one if you increase the level it gets brighter and vice versa the only thing which seems logic but you might forget about it when working in 3d is the inverse square fall off if you double the distance of your light to your object then it will only receive 25 percent of the light intensity the next thing is the softness of your light which is related to the scale of your light in relation to the object itself in real life you would just put a diffuser in front of your light source this is not possible in glow but we can simply increase the scale to achieve the same result so if your light is very small then only a tiny bit of your object gets highlighted and it looks very contrasty and sharp when you increase the scale a lot you first get to notice that also the intensity will increase we need to balance this out by decreasing its intensity number what's more important is the softness of the light the whole object is now more evenly illuminated comparing these two setups we will notice another thing which has to do with the softness of the light the shadow gets smoother when blazing a big light and gets sharper when only blazing a small light if you want to create realistic lighting i recommend you to mix different scale of lights just as in real life what's also visible is the reflection of the light itself especially at glossy materials for example metal it can be a creative way to play with some nice reflections we mostly know this from car commercial but also for more reflective and glossy garments or trims it's important to keep this potential in mind the last physical property is the color of the light source in real life barely any light is purely white the wavelength of each light is different so it comes that candlelight looks orange while neon light looks very cold and bluish you might want to consider adding a very slight of tint to your light your eye will still see it as white but it's the last step of photorealism or you want to create a certain mood then you choose a more saturated color but let's get more practical and dive into the lighting techniques and glow glow comes with several kind of lights which i don't wanna cover all of them the dome light is activated by default and already gives you a great start to begin your lighting for a quick and easy rendering this can be already enough and great stunning in the images in order to create our own lighting i recommend you to turn it off for now the most common and fastest lights to render is the rectangle light because it only emits light from one direction and it's comparable comparable to a soft box in real life most of the time you're doing quite fine just with these lights the directional light is also nice to create sunlight with hard shadows you don't have to worry about scale intensity and so on the directional light is made for sharp lights with hard shadows and the last important one is the sphere light this one looks like a light bulb it emits light to every direction it's kind of useful to place it inside your jacket or hoodie if it gets too dark inside to start i simply place one rectangle light in front of the garment i hide the visibility but not the illumination to see the result this is called flat lighting if you increase the scale to make it more soft then your garment will look flawless and elegant the amount of light spread over your object is even therefore you have fewer shadows and less contrast just to make it a bit more interesting you can simply lift it and rotate the angle pointing towards the garment you still keep the flawless look but at least you get to see some shadows my favorite one is the split lighting you only use one key light from the side this one looks very dark and dramatic but the viewer is curious to look more closely because he's not able to see some areas because they are too dark you can now create a fill light on top at the opposite direction just to clean up the dark areas and to keep the lost information in general this lighting setup is also called low key one level further would be the classic three-point light system as the name says we have now three lights arranged at three different locations first i move my fill light a bit more to the front kind of fun 45 degree angle next to the camera position then i place a rim light at the back of my garment to make it pop out from the back background and give it a nice bright outline this one is very famous for product lighting and also for movies you have a nice balance of shadows and don't lose any information of the image so what's the best approach to start with your own lighting as mentioned before i would turn off the dome light first and start with an empty dark scene then place each light one after each other instead of creating all of them at once if you are not sure what effect the light has on your garment it's super helpful to temporarily colorize the light once you've placed the light you can change the color back to neutral keep in mind that more lights will also increase the render time and on top more lights don't necessarily make your scene better actually the opposite is the case you will end up with a light mesh with no real ambience it can be a smart choice to keep your hdr light and bring it back later to your scene after you've placed the lights once you're used to blaze your lights manually you can keep the hdr light from the beginning on and just add the missing necessary lights to your setup one thing to mention is that there is no perfect light setup which works from every camera angle if you blaze a rim light at the back it will look nice at the front camera but from the back side it's just too bright in that case you need to come up with a new light arrangement for each camera position since glow 6.0 it's possible to save all your render properties in an external file this also includes the blazed lights in your scene so once you've came up with a nice lighting you can apply this one easily for the whole product line you've created that's all from my side i hope you've enjoyed this short workshop and learned something new thank you for tuning in and have fun with the user conference and the following presentations you ",
        "Summary": "# Comprehensive Guide to Lighting Techniques in 3D Design ## Introduction to Lighting in 3D Design Lighting is a critical aspect of 3D design that can dramatically affect the appearance and mood of your scenes. Proper lighting can enhance details, create depth, and guide the viewer's eye to specific areas of interest. This guide will cover the basic principles of lighting, the properties of different light types, and practical techniques to achieve stunning results in your 3D designs. ## Importance of Learning Lighting 1. **Shape and Detail Enhancement**: Proper lighting highlights shadows and details in your objects/garments, providing depth and realism. 2. **Guiding Attention**: Bright spots attract the viewer's eye, allowing you to emphasize important features. 3. **Mood Creation**: Lighting sets the atmosphere—whether dark and dramatic or bright and cheerful. 4. **Quality Improvement**: Knowledge of lighting can significantly enhance the overall quality of your final images. ## Basic Rules of Lighting 1. **Intensity**: - Increasing the intensity makes the light brighter. - **Inverse Square Falloff**: Doubling the distance from the light source reduces the intensity to 25% of its original value. 2. **Softness of Light**: - Related to the size of the light source relative to the object. - Larger light sources produce softer shadows; smaller sources create sharp, contrasting shadows. 3. **Reflection**: - Glossy materials reflect light differently. Consider how reflections can add realism and interest to your design. 4. **Color of Light**: - Real-world light sources vary in color (e.g., candlelight is warm, while neon lights are cool). - Adding a slight tint can enhance realism or create mood. ## Lighting Techniques ### 1. Basic Light Types - **Dome Light**: Default light providing a good starting point for lighting. - **Rectangle Light**: Acts like a softbox, providing directional light. Best for most rendering tasks. - **Directional Light**: Creates hard shadows, suitable for simulating sunlight. - **Sphere Light**: Omnidirectional light useful for illuminating interiors. ### 2. Setting Up Your Lights #### Step-by-Step Instructions 1. **Turn Off the Dome Light**: Start with a blank scene for full control. 2. **Place Rectangle Light**: - Position it in front of the garment. - Hide visibility but keep illumination to observe the effect. - Adjust the scale for softness; increase intensity if necessary. 3. **Experiment with Angles**: Lift and rotate the rectangle light to observe changes in shadow and highlight. 4. **Implement Split Lighting**: Use a single key light from the side for dramatic effects. 5. **Add Fill Light**: Position it opposite the key light to balance shadows. 6. **Classic Three-Point Lighting**: - **Key Light**: Main light source. - **Fill Light**: Reduces shadows. - **Rim Light**: Backlight to highlight edges. ### 3. Tips for Effective Lighting - **Start Simple**: Begin with one light and add more as needed. - **Colorize Lights Temporarily**: This helps visualize the effect before reverting to neutral. - **Beware of Render Time**: More lights can lead to longer render times without necessarily improving the scene. - **Adjust for Camera Angles**: Lighting setups may need to change based on the camera position to avoid overly bright or dark areas. - **Save Render Properties**: In Glow 6.0 and later, save lighting setups for reuse across multiple projects. ## Conclusion Lighting is a fundamental skill in 3D design that can transform your work. By understanding the properties of light, experimenting with different setups, and applying the techniques outlined in this guide, you can significantly enhance the quality and impact of your designs. Remember to practice regularly and try new lighting configurations to find what works best for your style and objectives. Happy designing!"

        "Transcript": "welcome to the intermediate design workshop i'm wendy and i'm a 3d designer from the hong kong office in this session we'll go through the basic workflow of a wire bra creation and some techniques for intimate wear if you have any questions feel free to use live chat at the side and we'll try to answer all of your questions there so before we start there are few things to prepare the first one will be an intimate avatar so we'll need to arrange the body measurement according to the cup size you need to present and also make sure that it's nude the second will be a wire gum file so basically the brow wire is also created by pattern what we do is add pins at the two end and then turn on simulation to drape the wire on the avatar so the y shape will be highly related to the design so we'll need to create several wire for a different style when you're satisfied delete all the pins and then freeze the pattern to hold the shape so try to keep the curve smooth and natural and place it close enough to the effect then save the file and we'll use it afterwards the first thing that we need is a dxf file a dxfl is a digital format of pattern and is compatible to most 2d and 3d cad other than using the existing pattern from a dexa file i can also create a stripe pattern by the rectangle too and then half of the patterns are ready i'll use the symmetric clone function to copy the other half next move all the patterns away so i can see the avatar clearly and turn on arrangement point select patterns and click on the points to place it with the symmetric linkage you can see that i only need to do one side and the other side will follow now we can start sewing so i'm using the segment sewing tool and click on pattern outlines to apply the sewing line make sure the sewing direction is the same and pre-fill your sewing lines in the 3d window when everything is ready turn on the simulation to check the effect when the simulation is on gravity is supplied and you can touch the garment like real life the next step will be adding the wire garment file to workplace we'll need to sew the wire on the bra internal lines on the bra pattern is needed for sewing offset as internal line to create these lines with the same shape of the pattern outline now start sewing the components of the intermittent wear is usually very small so make sure that you zoom close enough to see clearly and the sewing line type should change to turn because the wire pattern is going to be overlapping with the bra pattern and it helps to maintain a better simulation effect simulate again and now you can see the brow shape is holded by the brow wire but the hem still look a little bit loose we'll need some elasticity for better fit so select the pattern outline and then we'll apply elastic you can find the elastic function in property editor just click on to activate now the fitting improved but there are still some wrinkles on the bra cup because of the loose stripes so i'm going to adjust the pattern by moving the pattern outline and reduce the length in my own measurement don't forget to apply elastic on the stripe pattern as well after that we can work on the bra pad i'll hide the avatar to see inside of the bra clearly and freeze the stripe pattern to prevent it drops next select the bra cup pattern and use the layer clone function to copy the under layer you can see the new pattern is automatically placed under the original one i'll delete the sewing lines connecting the two layers and apply again because i want to remove the seam line at the middle of the under layer because bra pad don't have any seam lines to hide this thin line i'll use the edit pattern 2 to select this sewing line and change the 3d seam line intensity to zero and this is also how we express the seamless effect other than removing the seam line visually i can also merge two pattern into 1 so select the center front right click to merge and it become 1 pattern now and this is how we create a basic wire bra for the trims like stripe slider and rain we import to cloud as an obj file and after we import it the size the color material can still be changed for hook and eye these are actually pattern applied with the texture image usually we create several of these basic blocks and develop the design on top i'll try the ellipse pattern 2 to draw a ruffle pattern prepare an internal line and then use this line to cut also applying symmetric linkage to these two pattern for better control and this time use the free sewing to sew it from the stripe to the cup this time i'll use another method to place the pattern which is the super impose it help us to place the pattern according to the sewing line we applied and no need to spend extra time to place pattern manually copy and place for the second layer of ruffles and i'll change the whole pattern by scale and do the sewing super impose to place pattern to show more detail of small pattern and for a more realistic look we usually change the particle distance of the intermediary pattern to 5 or even lower when you're finished unfreeze all the pattern to see the true color of the fabric i'm going to add some buttons on the center front as a decoration and change the pattern shape in a default library we provide more than 30 styles from soul food buttons to revet the pattern size material and also color can still be arranged if i want to copy all the buttons at once ctrl c to copy ctrl v and right click at the same time to have this paste window so i can paste all the buttons in the same distance at once rotate to the back and we'll work on top stitches i'm using the free top stitch to apply stitch line so i can draw the line across all the pattern outline and i will change the distance from the pattern outline by offset you can see we will be able to change to different top stitch shape like zigzag overlap bar tag i'll knit more than one stitch line in the same style so i'm adding more in the configuration and adjust the distance from the first line after that i'll focus on fabric for fabrics we need a normal map to express the uneven structure of the fabric i can adjust the intensity to make the effect more obvious and we'll change the material by material type for shiny effect scroll the bar in reflection intensity to make the fabric less shiny after that i would like to apply a lace fabric for the upper layer of my bra cup for lace fabric we need to prepare a png file and you can drag the intensity bar to have the lace structure change the color to match with the underlayer i also like to apply lace for the ruffle pattern select all this ruffle pattern and right click to assign to new fabric we also need a png file and i'll use the edit texture too to move the texture image matching with the pattern shape repeat for the other side and don't forget about the normal map if we created other items we can add it to workplace and do mix and match i'm adding these panties to see how it looks with the bra as a set when i'm happy with the combination i'll change to color weight mode to test various color options on one style not only fabric trims like buttons and top stitches are also included i can select the color chips in colorway editor window and change the color all at once or i can select the fabric type in object browser and change the color in property editor like the usual way for the fret colorway i would like to change to another fabric material before that make sure all the color of this fabric will set back to white and apply with the texture image the rest of the color i will change it in the colorway editor after that update the thumb now so it will reflect the same wheel as the 3d window for fabric texture we can use the added texture tool in 3d window to change the grain line of each pattern you can also drag the ball to rescale the texture image and rotate and this function is also available in 2d window so this is the render result of the bra in different materials and colorways hope you had a great time and gain some knowledge please also check out the other design workshops and presentations throughout the day thank you ",
        "Summary": "# Comprehensive Guide to Wire Bra Creation in 3D Design Welcome to the intermediate design workshop on creating a wire bra, hosted by Wendy, a 3D designer from the Hong Kong office. This guide will provide you with step-by-step instructions, definitions, tips, and tricks to successfully create a wire bra using 3D design software. --- ## Workshop Overview ### Objectives - Understand the basic workflow of wire bra creation. - Learn techniques for designing intimate wear. ### Materials Needed - **Intimate Avatar**: A 3D model representing the body measurements corresponding to the desired cup size. It should be in a nude color. - **Wire Gum File**: A file containing the wire design for the bra, created using patterns. - **DXF File**: A digital pattern format compatible with most CAD software. - **Texture Files**: PNG files for lace and other fabric textures. - **3D Design Software**: Software capable of simulating garment design (e.g., Clo3D, Marvelous Designer). --- ## Step-by-Step Instructions ### Step 1: Prepare the Intimate Avatar 1. **Create or Obtain an Avatar**: Ensure the avatar matches body measurements for the targeted cup size. 2. **Nude Color**: The avatar should be in a nude color to accurately simulate the bra design. ### Step 2: Create the Wire Gum File 1. **Design the Wire**: Use patterns to create the wire structure. 2. **Add Pins**: Place pins at both ends of the wire pattern. 3. **Turn On Simulation**: Activate the simulation to drape the wire over the avatar. 4. **Adjust and Freeze**: Once satisfied with the shape, delete the pins and freeze the pattern to retain the wire shape. Ensure curves are smooth and natural. ### Step 3: Create the Bra Patterns 1. **DXF File Import**: Import a DXF file containing the initial bra patterns. 2. **Create Stripe Patterns**: Use rectangle shapes to create stripe patterns. 3. **Symmetric Clone**: Use the symmetric clone function to duplicate half of the patterns. 4. **Move Patterns**: Shift all patterns away from the avatar for clarity. 5. **Arrangement Point**: Select patterns and click on arrangement points to place them symmetrically. ### Step 4: Sewing the Patterns Together 1. **Segment Sewing Tool**: Click on the outlines of the patterns to apply sewing lines. 2. **Check Sewing Direction**: Ensure that the sewing direction is consistent across all seams. 3. **Activate Simulation**: Check the garment's draping effect under gravity. ### Step 5: Add the Wire to the Bra 1. **Sew Wire to Internal Lines**: Use the bra’s internal lines for sewing the wire pattern. 2. **Adjust for Overlapping**: Change sewing line types to accommodate overlaps and ensure proper simulation. ### Step 6: Enhance Fit with Elasticity 1. **Select Pattern Outline**: Choose the pattern outlines that need elasticity. 2. **Apply Elastic**: In the property editor, activate the elastic function to improve fit. ### Step 7: Create the Bra Pad 1. **Hide the Avatar**: This step helps in clearly viewing the bra's interior. 2. **Layer Clone**: Copy the underlayer of the bra cup pattern. 3. **Remove Seam Lines**: Delete any sewing lines connecting the two layers. 4. **Change Seam Line Intensity**: Set the seam line intensity to zero for a seamless effect. 5. **Merge Patterns**: Right-click to merge the front patterns into one. ### Step 8: Add Decorative Elements 1. **Import Trims**: Import trims like sliders and rings as OBJ files. 2. **Change Size and Color**: Adjust the size, color, and material of trims as needed. 3. **Create Ruffles**: Use the ellipse pattern tool to create ruffles and apply symmetric linkage. 4. **Superimpose Patterns**: Use superimpose to align the ruffle patterns easily. ### Step 9: Add Stitching and Fabric 1. **Apply Top Stitches**: Use the free top stitch tool to create decorative stitch lines. 2. **Adjust Stitch Shapes**: Change stitch types (zigzag, overlap, bar tag) and adjust distances as needed. 3. **Select Fabrics**: Choose fabrics and apply normal maps to simulate texture. ### Step 10: Final Adjustments and Rendering 1. **Apply Lace Fabric**: Use a PNG file for lace texture on the upper layer of the bra cup. 2. **Mix and Match Items**: Add additional items, like panties, to evaluate the complete set. 3. **Colorway Testing**: Use colorway editor to test various color options. 4. **Update Thumbnails**: Ensure that thumbnails reflect the latest designs. 5. **Render**: Finalize the design and render the bra in different materials and colorways. --- ## Tips and Tricks - **Zoom In**: Always zoom in when working on small components, especially for intimate wear. - **Use Simulation**: Utilize the simulation tool regularly to visualize how the garment behaves in real life. - **Experiment with Patterns**: Don’t hesitate to try different shapes and patterns to achieve unique designs. - **Save Progress**: Regularly save your work to avoid losing progress. - **Texture Adjustments**: Experiment with normal maps and material types to get the desired fabric effects. --- ## Conclusion By following this comprehensive guide, you should be equipped to create a basic wire bra design in a 3D environment. Practice these steps, and feel free to reach out with questions during the design process. Happy designing!"

        "Transcript": "hello he's olga i'm a 3d designer at chloe office i'm going to explain how to visualize denim and add different special effects such as washing laser prints grinding and so on the interest in this topic is getting higher and there are new opportunities thanks to new features and new integrations during this workshop you can ask any questions in the live chat on the site and they will be answered let's start our project with already built up garments we start by applying fabrics our claw library contains three types of denim with visual and physical properties you can also digitize your own denim fabrics and use them for the pockets i'm going to use simple cotton an easy and fast option to change a fabric is to de-saturate its texture and change the color for it so i go to object browser texture desaturate and choose the color and since the backside of denim usually has a lighter color we can reproduce it in claw by unchecking use same material as front for the back and changing its color we recommend doing it for all denim fabrics to achieve more realistic results in case you're happy with the physical properties of these denim fabrics you can use them but with your own textures how to create a good texture for denim it's important to cut a big piece of fabric and make sure the part you choose does not have any washing or scratches then you can clean this picture in a graphic editor create a seamless repeat and adjust colors according to your real fabrics then it's recommended to create a normal map for this texture and do the same process for the back you can also create different variations of color and washings for this scan texture let's take a look how this denim will look and claw i simply drag and drop textures and normal maps to my denim fabric for the front and for the back you can also create different color ways and apply different textures to them you can find colorway mode here in this way you can get a great overview of these garments in different colors and washings don't forget also to change the texture and the normal map for the back side of the fabric here we have some standard tanium but we can also create something special for example denim and purple you can name all your colorways according to washings and colors if you think that your 3d garments miss thickness you can add a bit of additional thickness rendering for all denim pattern pieces some pattern pieces are doubled by its construction in case you use two pattern pieces for it for example as on the jacket cuffs it will be enough of the thickness in other case when you just use one pattern piece and you want to fix this effect you should use a bigger value here for additional thickness rendering as well as switch on double-sided geometry as for the fabrics copy an existing denim fabric apply to all pattern pieces where you want to fake a double-sided construction and in the property editor for the back check use same material as you might know denim garments are often washed after sewing this results in some tension and seams that can be recreated in claw you would need to choose seams that you want to apply some tension check this box in the property editor and adjust parameters according to your denim something like strength 3 and ratio 97 then you can simulate and adjust these values you can also reduce and cancel tension for some of the seams the final adjustments should be done once you put your garment in high resolution the other property you can change for the seam is its normal map since most denim fabrics are sick the sims go deeper you can increase the 3d intensity of normal map and make it thicker here i put intensity to 30 and thickness to 4 but i may also adjust it later top stitching is very important for denim garments there are some tricks you can use to add a much more realistic look to it let's start with creating a simple top stitch for the edge and adjusting its properties i will rename it to denim one needle three millimeters first of all the type should be obg because this top stitch has 3d geometry if your computer is slow you can temporarily use texture because adjust the picture and requires less calculation but before rendering change it to obg offset here i would use three millimeters from the edge since thread for denim is sicker it also influences the size of top stitches here i would recommend using length 2.8 millimeters and you can also add a bit of space in between 0.3 millimeters thread thickness 140 for the color let's choose a standard for denim bash orange and the last check 3d to activate a normal map for top stitching then you can copy this style of top stitching and create its variation for example the same but with a bigger offset for the hem like for example here and another style that would be a double needle i'm changing configuration number of lines too and then you need to apply it all over your jeans as you can see you can also use bartok it's also one of the standard styles that claw offers in this way you should apply all necessary topstitching to your garments it's always good to use real garments as a reference and of course you can change top stitching colors for each of your color ways puckering helps to fake realism of 3d garments by adding shadowed height and depth around the seams background tools can be found here to show you how it works i will apply a puckering here then the preset of the puckering can be changed to denim now i'm changing the properties to make the puckering more visible you can pay attention how it changes in the 3d window you can use this preset and add puckerings every way it might be needed and then adjust its properties it is recommended to do it while you have your render preview opened the other way to work with puckering is to create your own library of puckerings by scanning parts of adenium garment here on the left you can see a scanned picture to create a puckering from it you would need to extract a texture and a normal map to extract the texture move the seam to the edge of the image then erase the part that is just denim after that you would need to extract shadows and highlights to create a black and white image and then it makes sense to blur it a bit when creating a normal map make sure to get rid of the denim fabric structure where it's not needed on the right you can see how this puckering would be translated to claw here you can see a comparison of different scan seams on the left and creating custom puckerings in claw on the right when applying those puckering effects make sure you choose the right seam the right side and the right size of puckering it always needs a bit of time since there are so many seams and again you can use a real garment as a reference to know where which effect should be i have applied a bottom hem puckering and now i'm going to apply some puckering to the side seam as you can see the effect is quite visible in the 3d window here we have a flat felt seam it's a sim with overlapping on one side it has a double needle top stitch so we add a puckering effect for it and since this side is higher than the other we add a seam shadow puckering on the other pattern piece now you can see how these seams don't look flat anymore and i will keep applying puckering to save your time during this workshop we sped up this video but as you can see all you need to do is to be a bit patient and apply puckering effects everywhere they are needed here we have jeans and then we do the same for the jacket this process can take some time and some patience but as a result you get a garment that looks much more realistic the 3d viewer and the render may show puckering differently so make sure to adjust these effects using render preview there is no right or wrong settings for these effects everything depends on your garments and what you find the most realistic now i go to render settings our new feature global map sympathetic intensity allows to change the intensity of all puckering's normal maps at once also you need different settings for different denim colors in clause 6.0 we added a new feature a texture editor it allows you to mix and blend different images for one of the maps and create all over washings and effects on top of the fabrics thoughts as it you should select the fabric go to the property editor and click here on the right from the texture here you can add another layer on the top i choose an image with a white asset washing on a transparent background and simply drag and drop it from the library to the texture editor a really nice thing about the texture editor is an opportunity to blend one layer on top of another for the all over washing effects i would recommend to choose the option of soft light or overlay you can also adjust the opacity and the color and in this way you can check how your denim will look with different version effects for example a cloud wash another nice thing you can do here is to create a less engraved pattern i would drag and drop a picture with stars and here again we choose soft light blending option for this image and here we can change the scale of our pattern by making the picture smaller and tile it using texture editor is a very nice way to design and create prototypes of lesser engraved denim let's talk about design and the particular finishings since claw 6.0 we have an integration with genealogy you can find more about this integration in the main stage presentation with genealogy if you work with this company you can import gene files to claw i will show you how it works basically you work with it as with the graphic at this graphic choose the legs that you want to apply and then click on the pattern then you will need to do it for the other parts make sure that all corresponding pattern pieces have this effect for example added for the pockets you can temporarily position pattern pieces in 2d as they are positioned in 3d copy the graphics on the pockets and place them on the pattern pieces so that your dry finishings match and then you can return the pocket on its place here i will do it the same for the other pocket at first i will rotate it so it's in the same angle as the main pattern piece and place it on top of it then i can copy the dry effect and place it in a matching way now i can move my pocket piece back let's continue to do it for other pockets and other pattern pieces then you can adjust these graphics in the property editor selector and we recommend to set the opacity to a lower number and use a color close to your denim but a bit lighter open the render preview to double check how the final results will look like and here again adjust the color for the different color ways to achieve the most realistic results for different denim washings and colors the great thing about genealogy integration is that you can get the exact placement of the dry finishes on your dxf pattern if you created additional copies of washings graphics for some pattern pieces make sure to change their classification in the property editor to none since your main version graphics being classificationology and it's enough if you don't use genology in your company you can still use dry finishings from our library or even create them yourself in image editing software in this case i will take a default one you can find them in our library hardware and trims washing textures i choose scrapping calf used but i will apply it to the jacket now we can adjust the position and the size of this graphic and then duplicate it to symmetric pattern in the property editor you can find a new feature graphic configuration of a seam line check now the graphic goes over the seam to the other pattern pieces i will change the tolerance to one so that it does not jump to the sleeves or back tolerance means the difference between sides of a sewing connection then you can adjust the properties in the same way as we did for the gene file change the color to the lighter shade of the denim color and put opacity to a lower number the placement of these finishings will be available in the tech pack as well and of course you can adjust those finishings in colorways some genes look even more destroyed and often they have holes here you may already guess how we could add some let's start with adding a graphic with a picture of a hole it's always nice to use additional maps to give a more realistic look if you want to use calls through which you can see skin the image should be transparent in these areas but how do you achieve this see through holes and claw the best practice here would be to create an internal shape that goes around the entire hole you can do it with the internal polygon line then right click on this shape cut and sew the next step is to create a fabric that is transparent for this shape for that let's copy the existing denim fabric change its opacity to zero and assign it to the whole pattern piece in case you have not added any additional maps before you can do it now make sure both graphics on select on the whole pattern pieces are selected normal map can be generated automatically if you make its intensity higher a displacement map can be created with any graphic editor it will create fake volume of the broken threads make sure you input some number for amount for example here three millimeters and also reduce the particle distance to one so that the picture is more defined keep adjusting your displacement map always looking at the changes in the interactive render you can create raw adjacent claw into ways using s control edge image or using claw fur denim row h preset to do it in the first way you would need to create a pattern piece at first let's measure its length 3993 and then we create a rectangle the height could be for example 50 millimeters it depends on your scanned image now we need to create a transparent fabric make sure you copy the one that it's double-sided and change its opacity to zero now we can assign this fabric to our pattern piece the next step is to add this control edge as graphic also i will use a displacement map for it and set amount to 3 and particle distance to 1. right click on the graphic tile x axis to create a horizontal repeat then you can sew it to your garment and use superimposed side to place it easily let's add the raw edge on the other side and take a look how it looks in the render another way to replicate a raw edge is to create a fabric with material fill denim row edge preset in this case we also need a small fabric piece connected to the future row edge then we can copy the existing denim fabric and apply fill denim row edge now it's time to open the render since we can see fur only there it already looks quite good but you can modify the setting in order to achieve the look you want it also makes sense to desaturate the texture and add a lighter color because it's what raw edges usually look like there is no wrong color right here just experiment to get your desired results another effect grinding it's done with a special machine to give a destroyed look this can be done on pattern edges or simply somewhere on the fabric let's start internal polygon line and create several internal lines here a good way to recreate grinding is to create a top stitch with fill as a material and adjust it let's do it so now we have a new top stitch and we can change its parameters offset 0 so it is on the edge length 25 and let's choose material for denim row h then color very light blue and here we propose the following length 0.4 taper 0.4 density 15. then variance gravity 1 and curl radius 0.5 now let's apply this top stitch on the edge of the pocket and on the internal lines then we can open a render preview and adjust the properties further if it's needed there are no particular perfect settings for it it depends on your design you can also create several top stitches with different levels of grinding let's create a zika version that we will use for some areas of the pocket age and for the internal lines now we can open the render preview and change some parameters fill shape base band 0.4 and density 111 and then we go up to specification and change lengths to 6 millimeters to see the changes for the fur you would need to stop the interactive render and start it again here you can see another application of grinding on jeans on the back pocket some denim garments especially jeans have wrinkles in particular areas such as crotch or under the knee the wrinkle jeans look is created with chemicals and machines that manipulate the denim fabric and wrinkle it in the desired areas you can replicate this look in clock using internal lines and assign angles to them let me show how it would look like internal polygon line and let's create some lines here and to copy them to the other side we use copy mirror paste then we can first adjust their position now we can assign fold angles to them in the property editor i would go for 0 and 330. to make wrinkles more defined we can also apply strengthen to these pattern pieces and then simulate now we can solidify these pattern pieces and then unstrengthen them for this project i would uncheck fault rendering for the internal lines but it depends on how you want your wrinkles to look sometimes you simply delete the internal lines it is time for some final touches this always depends on your designs for example it's nice to create labels or to add your branding to buttons when you work with denium garments puckerings and dry finishings it's really important to do final adjustments working with the render preview i hope you enjoyed this workshop and were able to learn some new techniques we are looking forward to seeing your denim creations please check out asset design workshop and presentation taking place throughout the day bye bye you ",
        "Summary": "## Comprehensive Guide for Visualizing Denim in 3D Design ### Introduction This guide provides a step-by-step approach to visualizing denim and adding special effects such as washing, laser prints, grinding, and more. The techniques discussed are useful for 3D designers looking to create realistic denim garments using the CLO 3D design software. ### Getting Started 1. **Setup Your CLO Environment:** - Ensure you have CLO 3D installed and access to the CLO library. - Familiarize yourself with the interface, especially the Object Browser, Property Editor, and Texture Editor. 2. **Choose Your Denim Fabrics:** - Open the CLO library and select one of the three types of denim available (with visual and physical properties). - Optionally, digitize your own denim fabrics for custom designs. ### Applying Fabrics 1. **Basic Fabric Application:** - Select the garment in your project. - In the Object Browser, navigate to the texture settings. - Use the desaturate option to adjust the fabric color (choose a lighter color for the backside). 2. **Creating Custom Textures:** - Cut a large piece of denim fabric, avoiding any washing or scratches. - Clean the image in a graphic editor, create a seamless repeat, and adjust colors. - Generate a normal map for added texture. 3. **Applying Textures:** - Drag and drop the created textures and normal maps onto your denim fabric for both front and back. 4. **Creating Colorways:** - Use the colorway mode to create variations of the denim, adjusting textures and colors as needed. ### Adjusting Thickness and Rendering 1. **Thickness Adjustment:** - If your denim appears too thin, add thickness rendering. - For single pattern pieces, increase additional thickness rendering values. 2. **Double-Sided Geometry:** - For pieces requiring a double-sided appearance, ensure to check the double-sided geometry option. ### Simulating Seams and Tension 1. **Apply Seam Tension:** - Select seams that need tension and adjust the parameters (e.g., strength and ratio) in the Property Editor. 2. **Normal Map Adjustments:** - Adjust the normal map settings to give seams a deeper appearance. ### Creating Topstitching 1. **Create Top Stitching:** - Use the Object Browser to create a top stitch, adjusting parameters like type (set to OBG), offset, length, and thread thickness. - Change the color to standard denim colors (e.g., orange). 2. **Variations:** - Copy this style and create variations (e.g., double needle top stitching). ### Adding Puckering Effects 1. **Apply Puckering:** - Use the puckering tool from the background tools menu. - Adjust settings to enhance visibility in the 3D viewer. 2. **Creating Custom Puckerings:** - Scan parts of a denim garment and extract textures for custom puckering. - Use the puckering presets and adjust properties for realism. ### Working with Graphics and Finishing Effects 1. **Dry Finishing with Genealogy Integration:** - Import gene files and apply them to the corresponding pattern pieces. 2. **Using Graphics:** - Adjust graphics for pockets and other pattern pieces to match the denim finish. - Set opacity and adjust colors for realistic results. 3. **Adding Holes:** - Use transparent graphic images of holes and create internal shapes around them. - Assign transparent fabrics to these shapes and adjust normal maps for realism. ### Creating Raw Edges and Grinding Effects 1. **Raw Edges:** - Use the denim row edge preset to create a raw edge look. - Adjust opacity and color as needed. 2. **Grinding Effects:** - Create top stitches with specific parameters for grinding effects. - Apply top stitches to areas of the garment where grinding is desired. ### Wrinkles and Final Touches 1. **Creating Wrinkles:** - Use internal lines to create the desired wrinkle effects, adjusting angles in the Property Editor. 2. **Final Adjustments:** - Make final touches for branding, labels, and additional details. - Use the render preview to fine-tune all aspects of the garment. ### Tips and Tricks - **Patience is Key:** When applying puckering and other effects, take your time to ensure realistic results. - **Use Real Garments as References:** Always refer to real denim garments to inform your design choices and adjustments. - **Experiment with Settings:** There are no wrong settings; experiment with different values to see what looks best for your design. - **Utilize Render Preview:** Frequently check your render preview to see how adjustments affect the final look. ### Conclusion By following this guide, you can effectively visualize denim garments in CLO 3D, applying a range of effects for enhanced realism. With practice and experimentation, you will create stunning 3D denim designs. Enjoy your design journey!"

        "Transcript": "i am anisha a 3d designer with the claw india team in this workshop i'm going to show you how to create a simple environment using hdri as the name suggests hdra means higher dynamic range image dynamic range is the amount of data about the brightness of this image in short these images help us illuminate a scene in a cg environment so let's go ahead and see how we can use these hdri to create environments for our flow projects our first step would be to add an avatar with the pose make sure to choose a pose which is keeping in mind your environment whether it's a street view indoor view or a landscape a pose which complements the environment would help in making it look more natural then i'm going to switch on the render view to be able to add the hdri in the lighting properties there are different light options under the dome light when there is environment map and that is where we're going to place our hdr image there are a bunch of different websites which offer high quality hdr images free of cost a hdr image of size 2k is suitable for a chrome project a higher size would just make your profile heavy so now you can see that the hdr image is lending its lighting to this scene over here but we cannot see the hdr image itself so for that we need to click on the show option over here and now we are able to see the hdr image on the background but it is not proportional to the avatar so that we need to scale it down to match the avatar for that i am going to go to the camera properties and increase the field of view once i have got a desired distance i can just zoom in my avatar towards myself and also rotate it and i can pan my window and place the avatar as if it looks like she is walking on the ground so this is how we can make the avatar proportional to our hdr image so now since our avatar and the hdr image are proportional to each other we can use different areas of the hdr image as a backdrop for our avatar so if i want to use the same hdr image but different areas of the hdr image i can go and change the light angle over here and as you can see when i'm rotating or changing the light angle i am placing my avatar in different areas of the hdr image and this gives us a lot of versatility even when using a single hdr image and the lighting will also change according to the area of the hdr image where you are placing your avatar in and since its 360 degree photographic image it really gives us a wide variety of different backdrops in a single hdri that is how we rotate our hdr image now in case i want the same backdrop which i have currently and i want a different view of my avatar let me try and do this so you can see while i'm rotating trying to rotate my avatar even the hdr image moves along with it and i have less control over the view that i would want of the avatar so for that what we will do is we will go in the light properties and we will lock our hdr image to our camera once i have locked the hdri to the camera over here and now if i try to rotate my 3d window you can see the backdrop still remains the same but i have more control over how i can position the avatar so this is really helpful when you want to change the view of your avatar but keeping the backdrop same once you have explored around the hdri and now you have your avatar with the perfect backdrop you can also attach it to a physical camera and you have all the properties of a physical camera over here so you can change the iso shutter speed etc if you require it so it's like photo shoot on a cloudy day if you require more brightness in this image you can change the iso and it will also change the brightness over here so you can make these changes if it is required if you want a zoomed in shot of this view you can still use your field of view over here and get a zoomed in shot of this view and since i've attached the physical camera i can also click on the depth of field and using the focus by left click i can click over here and make the focus my avatar or the background so whatever if i click on the background my avatar will become blurry and the focus will become the background and if i click on my avatar over here my avatar will become the focus and the backdrop will become blurry it's also possible to remove certain strong hues in your image as in this one you can see there is a strong blue hue on the image so if i want to remove that i can use the physical camera white balance i can select a light blue color and this will cancel the blue in my image and now you can see the image looks much more natural and it does not have a blue hue all over it so when you have a hdri and the avatar which is perfectly set and you have a view but now i want to view my avatar completely with the shoes including so i can use something called the effects over here in the camera properties and there is a vertical tilt and a horizontal tilt and it is as the name suggests it tilts your image slightly so i will use the vertical tilt over here and you can use them in a positive or a negative value and i just need to make very very small changes so i'm just going to do 0.1 and you can see it tilted my image and now i can see the shoes of my avatar so this is what it does very minor changes without actually upsetting the entire scene this is how you can use hdri to create various simple environments for your flow projects you ",
        "Summary": "# Comprehensive Guide to Creating Simple Environments Using HDRI In this guide, we will walk you through the process of creating a simple environment using High Dynamic Range Images (HDRI) in your 3D projects. This tutorial is tailored for 3D designers like yourself and is divided into clear, step-by-step instructions, definitions, and useful tips. ## What is HDRI? **HDRI (High Dynamic Range Imaging)** refers to images that contain a greater range of luminosity than standard images. This means HDRI images can capture a wider spectrum of light, which is essential for illuminating scenes in computer graphics (CG). They are particularly beneficial in creating realistic lighting and reflections in 3D environments. ### Understanding Dynamic Range - **Dynamic Range**: The amount of data about the brightness in an image. In HDRI, this allows for more accurate and nuanced lighting in your scenes. ## Step-by-Step Instructions ### Step 1: Add an Avatar 1. **Choose an Avatar**: Select or import a 3D avatar model. 2. **Select a Pose**: Ensure the pose matches the environment you are creating (e.g., street view, indoor, or landscape). A complementary pose helps in achieving a more natural look. ### Step 2: Switch on Render View 1. **Enable Render View**: Activate the render view in your 3D software to see changes in real-time. ### Step 3: Add HDRI Image 1. **Locate Dome Light Settings**: Navigate to the lighting properties of your scene. 2. **Add Environment Map**: Under the dome light settings, find the option for the environment map. 3. **Load HDRI Image**: Choose an HDRI image from a high-quality source. Free websites like HDRI Haven or Poly Haven offer suitable images. - **Image Size**: A 2K HDRI image is typically adequate for most projects. Larger sizes may slow down your profile without significant benefits. ### Step 4: Adjust HDRI Visibility 1. **Show HDRI Image**: Find and click the “show” option to make the HDRI image visible in the background. 2. **Scale the HDRI**: Adjust the size of the HDRI image to match your avatar’s proportions. ### Step 5: Adjust Camera Properties 1. **Increase Field of View**: Go to the camera properties and increase the field of view (FOV) until you achieve the desired composition. 2. **Zoom and Positioning**: Zoom in on your avatar and rotate it as needed. Pan the window to place the avatar naturally within the environment. ### Step 6: Utilize Different Areas of the HDRI 1. **Change Light Angle**: Rotate the light angle to explore different areas of the HDRI image. 2. **Positioning Versatility**: Move your avatar around the HDRI to utilize various backdrops without changing the image. ### Step 7: Lock HDRI to Camera 1. **Lock the HDRI**: In the light properties, lock the HDRI image to your camera. This allows you to adjust your avatar's position without altering the backdrop. ### Step 8: Attach Physical Camera 1. **Attach Camera**: Attach your scene to a physical camera to gain additional control over camera settings. 2. **Adjust Camera Properties**: Modify settings such as ISO, shutter speed, etc. - **Brightness Adjustment**: Increase ISO for more brightness if needed. ### Step 9: Implement Depth of Field 1. **Enable Depth of Field**: Click on the depth of field option in the camera properties. 2. **Select Focus Point**: Use the left-click to focus on the avatar or the background, which will blur the other. ### Step 10: Adjust White Balance 1. **Remove Color Hues**: If there are strong hues, like a blue tint, adjust the white balance. - **Select Light Blue**: Choose a light blue color to neutralize the blue hue, making the image more natural. ### Step 11: Use Camera Effects 1. **Apply Vertical and Horizontal Tilt**: In the camera properties, use vertical and horizontal tilt to adjust the perspective slightly. - **Minor Changes**: Make small adjustments (e.g., 0.1) for subtle changes without disrupting the scene. ## Tips and Tricks - **Experiment with Different HDRIs**: Each HDRI offers unique lighting and tonal qualities. Experiment with several to find the best match for your project. - **Use Reference Images**: Having reference photos can help you understand how to position your avatar and HDRI for the best effect. - **Test Render Frequently**: Regularly test render your scene to see how the lighting and composition work together. - **Save Versions**: Save different versions of your project as you make significant changes. This allows you to revert if needed. - **Lighting Adjustments**: Don’t hesitate to tweak the HDRI settings and camera properties to achieve the desired effect. By following these steps and utilizing the tips provided, you will be able to create engaging and realistic environments for your 3D projects using HDRI effectively. Happy designing!"

        "Transcript": "today i'll give you a quick demo on how you can create betting products in clothes the first thing i'm going to show you how to make is a simple mattress shape so i'm going to first go into my 2d tool bar select this rectangle tool just click once in your 2d pattern window today i'll be making a half scale queen-sized bed so i'm going to put in 30 inches for the width and 40 inches for the height once that's done i'm going to go into my 3d window rotate this piece and just make sure check that the back of my fabric is facing the floor okay once that's done i'll just adjust it slightly so that it's closer to the ground you can then go ahead select this pattern piece and go edit in your property editor so i'll add additional thickness rendering so that it looks like an actual thick mattress if you find that the edges are a little bit too rounded out for your liking you can then go up here in curved side geometry you can turn the curvature percentage down a little bit and just depending on how you like your mattress to be rounded out on the edges you can adjust this number here according to your liking now i feel like my mattress looks pretty good the next thing i'm going to do is just go ahead click on file export and make sure i select obj once that's done just save it in a folder that you will locate later so i'll just type in mattress click save and once this menu shows up just make sure that you have it saved as a single object and this click option is checked and you can just leave the rest as is and once that's done just hit ok and you have now created your mattress obj file okay once you've created your mattress i've already linked my files to the library so i have the quick access over here i'm going to bring in my mattress right click select add to workspace make sure when you import your mattress import it as an avatar once that's done you just want to click ok and you'll have your nice mattress shape imported in the space if you ever want to rescale your mattress you can do that very easily at this step as well just click on the mattress obj and in specification in property editor you can also edit and adjust the measurement if you wish to do it this way now i have my mattress all set up the first thing i'm going to do is start creating a fitted sheet so i'm going to go back to the rectangle tool click once and again create a 30 by 40 inch square rectangle piece and again just make sure check that you flip your fabric and the back of the fabric is facing the top of your mattress once that's done just select this pattern piece and adjust it slightly so that it's laying nicely on top of your mattress okay once that's done all we have to do just create the four additional panels on the side i'm going to go into my edit pattern tool over here right click on the edge i want to extend select offset pattern outline and i'm going to put in 6.75 and make sure check internal line this create internal line is checked on and i'll do this for all of the other edges as well so that it creates the extended panel from all four sides okay once that's done you can then go ahead turn on simulation and you'll just have this bed sheen nicely draped over your mattress next let's go ahead and sew the four sides together i'll use this segment sewing tool just click once click two times and just have your four sides all sewn together okay once that's done we can go ahead and apply elastic and have it nicely tucked in so i'm back in my edit pattern tool just click and hold shift to select the four sides of your bed sheet and i'm going to go into elastic over here in my property editor and apply elastic to those four segments once the elastic is turned on simulate and you'll see now your bed sheet is being tucked nicely around your mattress once you have your mattress and fitted sheet all done let's go ahead and make a quilt so i will go back into the rectangle tool click again in my 2d pattern window and for the width this time i will put in 45 and the height will be 48 again i'm working in half skill queen size bed so this is also kind of the standard sizing for queen size quilts but in half skill once that's done again i'll just rotate it so that it's laying flat parallel to the ground and let's have it just on the side for now so don't put it on the bed just yet we're going to create the quilt line simulate before we apply it to the rest of our bedding okay for today's purpose i'll just create really simple quilt lines but using any of these internal tools you can just really play around and have any kind of quiltings done for you as well so when you create internal lines i'll just use the easiest way by creating it using the edit pattern tool right click and offset as internal line and let's do six over here and just add additional offsets and i'll just right click on this edge offset as internal line and i'll just make it in five for the distance once that's done we can then go ahead and start creating the quilting so now i am done with my quilt line designs i'm going to go back to the transform pattern tool right click on this pattern piece and i'm going to select layer clone under and this will automatically create a piece that is directly underneath the original as you can see it has it nicely stacked on top of each other the great thing about this function is that when you created the internal lines first it will also automatically sew together every single seam that is on the internal lines so for people who love to create quilts or any kind of padded products this is a super convenient function for you to use once that's done i'm going to select both of these pieces and strengthen them for the top layer i'm going to go to my property editor over here and set it at a positive pressure so i'll just do 10 and the bottom layer i'll have it set at a negative pressure when you have a piece of fabric that has the face facing out of the fabric you will set that at a positive pressure so for this bottom layer here i have the back of the fabric facing outwards so in that case i have it set at negative pressure so pressure is a great way for you to express any kind of product that has fill or quilting once that's done we can go ahead simulate the reason why i like to apply strengthen before simulating is that it will apply a temporary star to your fabrics makes it a little bit more stiff and if you do that before simulating it will allow the two layers of fabric to separate a little bit nicer once you do that initial simulation you can then right click on strengthen so that it goes back into its natural fabric simulate again and you'll see now the wrinkles and quilting looks a lot more natural okay once that's done i'm going to select both pattern pieces for my quilt and group it together and now you have your quilt completed as well once you have your quilt successfully simulated let's go ahead and create the pillow so i'm going to again go back into my rectangle tool in my 2d pattern window just click once in your 2d space and then i'm going to put in my measurements so it's going to be 14 inches wide and 10 inches the height now that i have the basic pattern piece for my pillow i'll just rotate again to make sure that it's laying flat against the surface of the ground once that's done i'm going to go ahead right click and select layer clone under once that's done for this top layer i'm going to set the pressure at five the bottom layer i'll do it at negative five once that's all done just go ahead and strengthen the pieces turn on simulation and you should see your pillow gradually simulate okay once that's done i'll just remove strengthen and let it simulate in its natural fabric now that i have the pillow insert created i'll just group these pattern pieces adjust it so that it's slightly above ground and then i'm going to freeze these pattern pieces before i create my pillow case once that's done go back into your 2d pattern window right click select copy right click again and i want you to paste that new copy on top of the original once you have the second copy created just move it out of the way in your 2d and the new copy won't retain the grouping so you do not know that this is your new copy and i'm going to just um freeze these pattern pieces and then move this so that it's slightly above the original and then just adjust this one so that it's slightly below so whenever you readjust these pattern pieces you want to make sure you kind of arrange it in the order that you will have it eventually end up in so since this will be my pillowcase i want to make sure that it lays nicely on the outside of this pillow insert once that's done simulate again and you should have your pillow nicely simulated on the outside of your pillow insert once that's done i'm going to start and make some additional pattern edits so i'm going to first select both of these pattern pieces and then use my edit sewing tool and then i'm going to delete the sewing okay once that's done i'm going to go back into my edit pattern tool right click on one of the edges on the right hand side and then i'm going to select offset pattern outline so that it will allow me to extend from that original edge so my extension is going to be 2 inches and just double check that create internal line is checked on once that's done click ok and then you can just right click on that internal marking that we checked on and then select cut and sew and then do the same for this bottom one and now you have that extended panel created and you see it automatically sews together that seam for you so all you have to do now is take your free sewing tool sew back together these two edges and then i'll use the segment sewing to sew together these remaining areas as well once that's done i'm just going to use my gizmo to rearrange these pattern pieces and if you're scared that it won't simulate properly what you can do before you simulate again is use my favorite tool strengthen so that it applies a temporary start to your fabric so that it's a little bit more solid once that's done turn on simulation and you should have the pillowcase sewn together and before you bring it back to its natural state make sure you select both of these pattern pieces and set the pressure back to zero remove the strengthening and simulate again and then if you want it to lay nicely what you want to do is also unfreeze the pillow insert that you have on the inside and then just move it slightly closer to the ground simulate again and it will just lay nicely and on top of your ground once that's done if you want to add an additional pillow you can directly create a duplicate of this one as well if you paste it on top of your original this will allow you to quickly locate that new set of pillows so this is the second duplicate that i've made and that will just allow me to create the duplicates really easily before you start moving things around again i would suggest you group them together so you have everything that is belonging to the same set of pillows all grouped together now that you have all of your bedding products created we can go ahead and bring in the bread frame i'm going to right click and select add to workspace and just double check that you import it as an avatar since it will interact with the soft fabrics in your workspace this bed frame i created in khloe as well so feel free to experiment different kind of 3d modeling techniques in clothes if you have time once that's done i'll select my pillows and just gradually position them so that it's closer to the front of my bed before i start simulating these pieces again okay and i'll just gradually move this so that slightly towards the center once you have your pillows nicely adjusted if you want them to drape a little bit more naturally on your bed but you don't want them to lose the shape completely a trick that you can do is click and hold and select your pin box tool and just place a group of pins on the top edge of your pillowcase once you have the pins placed you should see it appear in your 3d like this and what this does is it places a group of pins on the top edge of your pillow so once you turn on simulation it will just kind of hold it in place which gives you a little bit more control since when you click on that pin group you can then use your gizmo and very gently adjust it and push it towards the top of your bed and now you have them laying nicely and standing nicely on top of your bed once that's done i'll just turn off simulation and move it closer to that headboard if you feel like the pins are kind of distracting you from the aesthetics of how you want to view your bed in the display button on the top you can under 3d garment select show pins and once you click on that you'll be able to turn off the pins okay now that's done i'm going to select my comforter over here and then just again gradually move it so that it's laying on top of my bed and then before you simulate it you just want to make sure that it's nice and centered   once you're all set up since it's a bigger piece of textile i'll just make sure to strengthen it again before i simulate okay and once you hit simulate it should just lay nicely over the bed like this once it does that initial simulation set it back to its original fabric state so that it will drape a little bit nicer on your bed okay now you have a completed bed setting created in clothes you ",

        "Transcript": "today i'm going to show you everything related to avatar editor this video is going to take you through all the details required to creating your own custom size avatar so let's go ahead and get started the first thing i'm going to do is import in an avatar and you will find our claw avatars in the library here we have a number of avatars they are divided into male v1 v2 female v1 v2 and we have a kid folder and 3d shapes i'm going to be working in female v2 folder in case your folder looks a little bit different than mine don't worry it's because you are using a different version of clothes so you will find your avatars either in the female v2 or v1 folder so to get started i'm going to import in an avatar i will be working with fifi over here simple double click and that will import in my avatar into my 3d space you can see the shadow in the 2d window and from here on we're going to go ahead and explore the sizes so the first thing i want to show you guys is the close size folder this is the default close size folder that you have and in here you have usas sizes you have them in missy curvy and straight and then you have the same in petite and in plus size to import these sizes you simply have to double click on them and you'll see automatically the size of my avatar has changed i'm just trying a size 14 and you just have to double click to add in these particular sizes you can also drag and drop them i'm gonna go ahead and try another size folder just simply drag and drop or you can just double click on either of these size quarters and you'll see your avatar will change according to that particular size now we also have clone maternity avatars and in these we have the same process that you would for any of the astm sizes you simply click on the maternity folder and go ahead and either drag and drop or double click to add in your maternity avatars and you'll see automatically khloe will adjust the avatar to create its maternity avatar so i'm gonna go back to the female default size because i'm gonna explore more in getting a perfect custom size so double click and now i have my default size which you would get if you imported any of these avatars so now that we've explored all the cloud default sizes i'm going to show you guys how to create an avatar from a size chart so over here on the top we have avatar and then avatar editor this will open a pop-up box which will have a different sets of measurements available in them we're gonna do this point by point and you'll see your avatar has dotted lines around it this will highlight based on which measurement you're changing or the one you're selecting so we're gonna start with total body and here you have the height and the width now in the height you have either the total height the hps height or the inseam height based on what your size chart has you can customize it on each of them hps height to see which it is as soon as you click on that you'll see it gets highlighted in yellow so in case you're a bit confused don't worry chloe will highlight the measurement for you i would suggest not to use the total height since the head size of the avatar may vary it would be better to use either hps height or inseam height in case you are customizing any dress form or a dummy the inseam height works the best for the width we have the option of bus circumference and underbust circumference so you can set that again according to your size chart we also have the option of changing the measurements so in millimeter centimeter inch or feet an inch i'm setting it to centimeters because that is what my size chart is and now i'm gonna change the values so my hps height and you can see immediately the avatar will change to the height value that you put in i'm now going to go ahead and change my bus circumference and once this is done i have the two values that are my total body values from this we're going to go ahead to the details and in that we have the option of basic in basic you'll be able to see that we have three options you have basic and then advanced human body and advanced dress form advanced human body is when you're replicating a real life model's measurements and advanced stress form is when you're replicating a dummy measurements i'm going to start with basic and i'm just gonna double check that the value i'm using is centimeter so this next part is going to be sped up a little as i put in my values but one pro tip to remember is that when you're adding in your values always change your height measurements before your circumference measurements this creates a good workflow for when you want to customize any avatar you will also notice that you will find a marginal error that will come at the side of your measurement block this margin of error is used to adjust the appearance and the proportion of the measurements relative to the rest of the body now that we've completed the basic measurements i'm gonna go into advanced human body since i have a few extra measurements on my size chart so just simply click there and you have advanced human body open so you're again the same method that we followed before i'm gonna change all the heights first and then the circumference i am also only changing the measurements that are extra the ones that i've already changed in basic i won't be changing them over here so only the extra measurements that are in the advanced human body now i'm gonna move on to advanced stress form because i have a few measurements there as well in case you do have a dummy measurement that you're following i would suggest starting with your basic and then moving into advanced stress form for them so here i have a few measurements such as shoulder drop and the vertical trunk that i'm going ahead and changing once this is done i have all my measurements changed according to my size chart and you can see my avatar is now based on the size chart and customized according to the size that i wanted now i'm going to show you guys how to save it so it's very easy there are two ways to save this particular customize avatar you can either save the size from here so you have the icon to save it so you pick a folder and then name your size it'll save as an avs file which is the clo avatar size file and now i'm going to delete this avatar and bring in another avatar from the v2 folder so let's bring in grace and grace is again in the default close size if i want grace to have the customized avatar size that i just had i'm just going to find it over here in my library and drag and drop and you'll see that now grace is customized to the avatar size that i saved earlier let's suppose i want to go ahead and save the complete avatar and not just the size folder what i can go ahead and do is on top in file we have the option to save as avatar and this will save grace as the complete avatar with the size so that's dot avt instead of dot avs again i'm just selecting the folder and naming my avatar once this is done go ahead and click on save and now you will find that avatar in the folder in my library right here so i'm going to delete the avatar that's currently in my workspace and just double click and you'll see that i can import in grace as a complete avatar you ",
        "Summary": "## Comprehensive Guide to the Avatar Editor This guide will take you through the process of using the Avatar Editor to create and customize your own avatars, based on the transcript provided. It includes step-by-step instructions, definitions of key terms, and tips and tricks for successful avatar creation. ### 1. **Importing an Avatar** #### Step-by-step Instructions: 1. **Open the Avatar Library**: Navigate to the library section within your software where the avatars are stored. 2. **Select the Appropriate Folder**: - Avatars are categorized into several folders: Male V1, Male V2, Female V1, Female V2, Kid folder, and 3D shapes. - For this guide, choose the **Female V2** folder. 3. **Import an Avatar**: - Locate the avatar you want to use (e.g., **Fifi**) and double-click on it to import it into your 3D workspace. ### 2. **Exploring Size Options** #### Step-by-step Instructions: 1. **Locate the Size Folder**: Find the **Close Size Folder** in your editor. 2. **Select a Size**: - You will see different size categories (USA sizes divided into Missy, Curvy, Straight, Petite, and Plus Size). - Double-click on a size (e.g., **Size 14**) or drag and drop it onto your avatar to change its size. 3. **Maternity Sizes**: To explore maternity options, navigate to the **Clone Maternity Avatars** folder and apply sizes similarly. ### 3. **Creating a Custom Size from a Size Chart** #### Step-by-step Instructions: 1. **Open the Avatar Editor**: Click on **Avatar** in the top menu, then select **Avatar Editor**. 2. **Adjust Measurements**: - A pop-up box will appear with various measurements. - Use the dotted lines to identify which measurement you are adjusting. 3. **Set Height**: - Adjust the **HPS Height** or **Inseam Height** instead of Total Height for better accuracy. 4. **Set Width**: - Adjust **Bust Circumference** and **Underbust Circumference** as per your size chart. 5. **Measurement Units**: Change the measurement units (millimeters, centimeters, inches, feet) based on your size chart. 6. **Input Values**: Enter the values for height and width. The avatar will update automatically. ### 4. **Using Basic and Advanced Settings** #### Step-by-step Instructions: 1. **Basic Measurements**: - In the Avatar Editor, switch to **Basic** settings. - Input your basic measurements first (e.g., height, bust, waist, hips). - **Tip**: Always change height measurements before circumference measurements for better workflow. 2. **Advanced Human Body Settings**: - Switch to **Advanced Human Body** for specific model measurements. - Input only the additional measurements that are not covered in the Basic settings. 3. **Advanced Dress Form Settings**: - If you have dummy measurements, switch to **Advanced Dress Form**. - Input relevant additional measurements here as well. ### 5. **Saving Your Customized Avatar** #### Step-by-step Instructions: 1. **Save Size Only**: - Use the save icon to save your size settings. This will create an **AVS file** (Clo Avatar Size File). - Choose a folder and name your size before saving. 2. **Save Complete Avatar**: - To save the entire avatar along with its size, go to **File** > **Save as Avatar**. - This will save your avatar as a **.AVT file** (Clo Avatar File). - Select a folder and name your avatar before saving. 3. **Importing a Saved Avatar**: - To import your saved avatar, delete the current avatar in your workspace and double-click the saved avatar from your library. ### **Tips and Tricks** - **Use Highlighted Measurements**: Pay attention to the highlighted measurements in the editor to avoid confusion. - **Keep a Consistent Measurement Unit**: Set your preferred measurement unit before starting to ensure consistency. - **Test Different Sizes**: Try various sizes to see how they affect the avatar's proportions and fit. - **Use the Marginal Error Feature**: Adjust based on the margin of error provided in the measurement block for better accuracy. ### **Definitions** - **AVS file**: Clo Avatar Size File used to save size information only. - **AVT file**: Clo Avatar File that contains both the avatar model and size information. - **HPS Height**: Height measured from the highest point of the shoulder to the floor. - **Inseam Height**: Measurement of the inner leg from the crotch to the ankle. By following this comprehensive guide, you should be able to effectively create, customize, and save avatars using the Avatar Editor. Happy editing!"

        "Transcript": "in this video we are going to go through the multi-texture editor and its relationship with the colorways here i am in my colorway mode and as you can see in close 6.0 your colorway editor has been slightly updated so that all the elements in your style have been organized into different sections if i wanted to add a new colorway i still will just have to go to this plus button here and select that now that i have a new colorway i'm just going to rename this as colorway b once my colorway b is highlighted i can then just go to my object browser and i'm going to first go to my cotton twill fabric this fabric also has a print on it it has a print on the back using the add print function i'm first just going to worry about the facing of this so i'm going to go to my texture editor tool here and now with this up i can now start to do a lot of different options so here i can select this and i'm going to change the color first i'm going to change it to a dark blue and i can add a second print so here i'm going to add another print here and i'm going to add this print here now that my print has been added i can start to adjust and move this around as normally i can tile this i can turn on desaturation and i can play around with my blend modes so i can try out multiply i can play around with the intensity of my desaturation i can switch around with my blend options still trying to figure out exactly which blend option i want i'm happy with this right now once i'm all set here i can then just hit apply because i'm going to now go into my texture editor tool and i'm going to play around with the size so here i'm going to make my size a little bit larger and i'm happy with that i don't want to change around any longer i could keep going around and playing around if i wanted to but i'm happy with how this is so i'm now going to hit apply and close and once i hit update you'll see that my colorway b has been updated to have this print now i also have this print on the back side of my fabric here i can start to adjust this now with the add print i could select different faces that will affect my first colorway though if i do i can then go into my multi-texture editor and play around with the type of print so here i can hit add and bring in a different print so i could resize this print so that it fits with r wise and i can delete this first print so that i just use this one i can resize this canvas if i'd like so that it fits the artwork that i'm using right here and again it's fine this is a transparent background because this is not print layer and i'm just going to select apply and close if i wanted to continue to adjust this print scale i would have to go to the transform section in the property editor that is because you cannot use the texture editor tool to just adjust the scale of the ad print the transformation tool will work with the entire texture so now i want to change the color of this print so i'm going to change the color to black i'm going to hit ok and also to help this print pop a little more i'm going to change the back of this cotton twill to not have a print on it so i'm going to uncheck same as front and then i'm going to go into my multi-texture editor window and i'm going to delete this print so that's just solid on my back and now i can hit apply and close and again that only affected the back and it only affected this colorway so as you can see we changed quite a while around in colorway b and none of that has affected color way a now of course as normal you could select your top stitches and change around the colors holding down shift is going to allow you to select multiple at once and now i'm all set with colorway b so here if i go to rib i see that my texture is desaturated and i have a color here if i uncheck desaturate and turn off this color this still will not affect colorway a i can go to my multi-texture editor here once this window pops up i can even add a print i can select add here and now i have a print here i can resize using my wheel tiling it all out i'm going to go into my fabric swatch here change the color around maybe i'm going to desaturate this a bit and i can change my circle colors so that this is a tonal but i just have to remember to hit desaturate and now i have a whole another rib t-shirt colorway so now this is all set i'm going to hit apply and close if i wanted to continue to play around the scale i would use my texture editor tool and now when i hit update you'll see that this has only affected color wavy if i switch back to color way a and i select this rib you will see that it's still desaturated and that the color is still the tofu however if i go back to colorway b the texture is no longer desaturated and i don't have any color so these are quite significant changes that have not affected either colorway another great ability with this multi-texture editor is the ability to change out graphics so here using this edit graphic tool i'm going to select this graphic i'm going to go to my texture editor and i'm going to add a second graphic here so i'm going to add this grab flower i can resize it i can adjust and play around with this i can move around the layers i can hit apply and now i have a whole new graphic on my jeans if i didn't want this splatter any longer i could delete this now i have a whole new print again and i could hit apply and close up hitting update you'll see the change but you'll see that it did not affect color way a so here i still have the splattering colorway a but in color wavy i have this floral graphic so now you can easily switch out a floral graphic so now i'm going to add a third and final colorway colorway c and in this colorway i'm going to change some prints around again so that you can see that even changing prints on top of new prints it still won't affect either colorways so going to this multi-texture editor i'm just going to add a wash on top i can delete this old print resize this wash turn on my desaturation lay around my colors and my blending and i can change my opacity around and once i'm all happy i can just hit apply and close now let's say i don't want any print on the back of my fabric here i'll have to change the opacity i cannot delete this print if i delete this print it will affect all the other prints if i hit delete here and if i hit update that will affect everything as you can see so as you can see i don't have any prints i'm just going to hit ctrl z very quickly so that i can undo this but as you can see deleting something will affect everything so if i just change the opacity down to zero though in this colorway and if i hit update it will only affect color way c it will not affect colorway b or a only c the same will be said for this graphic so if i select this graphic and change the opacity to zero hit update i'll still have the graphic on these two other styles but i won't have it on this third i can also change this color around with my texture editor and here i can just change this color to make it lighter hit okay and now i can just update this and now i can also change this rib around completely so i can go to my multi-texture editor and i can even go back to what i originally had so here i can just delete that print change it so i have no color here in my multi-texture editor and turn off desaturation apply and close and then add the desaturation in my property editor and change the color in my property editor and when i update it will not affect colorway b it only affects colorway c colorway b desaturation will still be checked off while in colorway c d saturation is checked on i hope you enjoyed this video thank you so much for watching you ",
        "Summary": "## Comprehensive Guide to Multi-Texture Editor and Colorways This guide provides an in-depth overview of using the Multi-Texture Editor in conjunction with colorways, based on the transcript of the video tutorial. The guide includes step-by-step instructions, definitions, and tips to help you navigate the software effectively. ### Definitions - **Colorway**: A specific combination of colors and prints applied to a design element (like a fabric or garment) that can be switched or altered independently. - **Multi-Texture Editor**: A tool that allows users to manage and modify textures, prints, and graphics applied to a design, providing an interface for layering and adjusting visual elements. - **Texture Editor Tool**: A specific tool within the Multi-Texture Editor that allows for detailed adjustments to textures, including color changes, sizing, and blending options. - **Prints**: Designs or patterns applied to the fabric, which can be layered and adjusted. ### Step-by-Step Instructions #### 1. Accessing the Colorway Mode - Open your design project and switch to **Colorway Mode**. - Note the new organization of elements in the style sections in the updated version (e.g., Close 6.0). #### 2. Adding a New Colorway - Click the **Plus (+) Button** to add a new colorway. - Rename the new colorway (e.g., \"Colorway B\"). #### 3. Selecting Fabrics and Textures - Highlight \"Colorway B\". - Navigate to the **Object Browser** and select the desired fabric (e.g., cotton twill). #### 4. Using the Texture Editor Tool - Open the **Texture Editor Tool**. ##### Adjusting the Fabric Color - Select the fabric and change the color (e.g., to dark blue). ##### Adding Prints - Click **Add Print** to apply a print to the fabric. - Adjust the print using the following options: - **Move**: Position the print as desired. - **Tile**: Repeat the print across the surface. - **Desaturation**: Toggle this option to lessen color intensity. - **Blend Modes**: Experiment with different blend modes (e.g., multiply) to find the desired effect. ##### Resizing the Print - Adjust the size of the print as needed, ensuring it fits the fabric appropriately. ##### Applying Changes - Once satisfied with the changes, click **Apply** and then **Close**. #### 5. Updating Colorway - Click **Update** to see changes reflected in \"Colorway B\". #### 6. Adjusting Backside Prints - For the backside of the fabric, access the **Add Print** feature again. - You can choose to alter prints specifically for the back without affecting the front. - Adjust the print size and apply changes. #### 7. Working with Graphics - Use the **Edit Graphic Tool** to switch or add new graphics to your design. - Resize and adjust the graphic as needed, then click **Apply**. #### 8. Creating Additional Colorways - Repeat the above steps to create \"Colorway C\" or any additional colorways. - Each colorway can have unique configurations, ensuring they do not affect others. ### Tips and Tricks - **Select Multiple Elements**: Hold down the **Shift** key while selecting multiple stitches or elements to change their properties simultaneously. - **Undo Actions**: Use **Ctrl + Z** to quickly undo any changes you’ve made if you accidentally delete or modify something you didn’t intend to. - **Opacity Adjustments**: Instead of deleting prints or graphics, adjust the opacity to zero to hide them while preserving their properties in other colorways. - **Consistency**: Keep track of your changes across colorways. If a specific change needs to be consistent across all colorways, make sure to apply it to each one manually. - **Experiment**: Don’t hesitate to try out different blend modes and desaturation levels. This experimentation can lead to unique and appealing designs. ### Conclusion The Multi-Texture Editor and Colorway features provide a powerful way to manage and customize your design elements without affecting other versions of your work. By following these instructions and utilizing the tips provided, you can effectively harness the capabilities of the software to create diverse and visually appealing designs. Happy designing!"

        "Transcript": "hello today i'm going to demonstrate how to construct a square let's get started the first thing i am going to do is bring in one of the clone default avatars you can find the avatars in your library folder once my avatar is in my workspace i can then bring in my dxf file i have my dxf pattern within my clo library allowing me to double-click to bring in my file once the patterns are brought in i will then start to organize them in my 2d window these are the waistbands the front is here and the back and here's the back now i will start to sew my pattern pieces together i will sew my pattern pieces together using the freesew tool since my front pant panels are going to be symmetrical i then can just select my patterns and create a symmetric copy my back patterns are not symmetrical so i will not create a symmetric copy here by right clicking i can then create a symmetric copy i'm now just going along the rest of my skirt to sew it up i'm now going to sew this waistband this is the front of the waistband i'm paying attention to my notch direction while i'm sewing this now that i finished sewing i am going to place my pattern pieces onto the avatar using arrangement points before i go to my arrangement points i'm going to use reset 2d arrangement to get my patterns in my 3d window to look like my patterns in my 2d window now i'm going to switch to thin textured surface so that i can see the back of my fabric easily and now i will go to my toggle menu to turn on my arrangement points using these points i can place my pattern pieces onto my avatar i can adjust my pattern pieces further by using my property editor over here and adjusting the offset and positions of my pattern piece pressing 8 will get me to my back view turning off my avatar and arrangement points i can then check my sill lines so here i'm going to hide my avatar now that my avatar is hidden i can check all my sew lines to make sure they're straight i can turn my avatar back on now i have to sew the inside waistband i'm going to use my freesew tool to sew the edges of my waistband together since these pieces should lay flat i'm going to change the so type to turn i can do this over my property editor i'm now going to select my pattern piece and instead of arranging it i'm going to go into my 3d window right click and superimpose under this will then place it underneath my pattern now i have simulated my skirt and the next step is just finishing up some final details selecting the hem and right clicking to offset the pattern outline to create the turn back that i want i'm going to use my edit pattern tool to select my end lines i'm now going to right click and offset as pattern outline i would like a one inch turn back so i'm going to put one inch and i'm going to make sure that my side segment type is mirrored now i'm going to hit okay now i have my one inch but i need to create a line to sew my turn back to so i'm going to reselect my hemlines right click and set as internal lines i'm going to make this one inch again but i'm going to create two of these and hit ok i now have all the lines i need to do a hold back i'm going to turn on my internal line so that i can easily see these lines to turn them back before i turn back i'm going to sew all of my relationships together since all of these sewing relationships will be facing each other i'm going to change the sew type to turn you can see in this image what the difference is between turned and flat sewing flat is your custom angle and turned is your turned angle this image will help you understand more clearly what the differences are now the last thing i'm going to sew is this part here and just make sure i have finished my ends and turning all of these angles now i can go into my fold arrangement tool in my 3d window to fold my hem back as you can see i can use the arrows to just fold my hem completely back once this is set i can simulate and i'll see my skirt and i have a full backhand now that my skirt is all set i'm going to get rid of the center front line i'm going to select all of the center front lines and right click and merge this will get rid of that center front now let's apply the fabric i have a rib in my fabric library that i'm going to use i'm just going to drag and drop it over fabric one to replace the fabric one with this fabric i'm going to turn this back to thick texture view and i'm going to select my interior waistband and add bonding the bonding is going to act as a fusible i can then simulate to see how this looks i'm going to turn this down to particle distance of 5 to check to see how this skirt drapes as you can see you see the line of this hem now i would like this to look as a blind hem so i want to get this line erased you can do this within glow i'm going to have to be in my edit sewing tool to be able to get rid of this line once i've selected my sewing relationship this will then help me get rid of the line that you see over here in your property editor you can change your normal map intensity to zero this will then hide the line to make it appear as a blind bend back now i'm ready to change this garment to a high res i'm going to use my high-res garment here and hit ok i'm then going to simulate and fit simulation once the garment has completely settled you can then turn off simulation now you have an a-line score you can continue to check it and if you want to make any changes you can but this is good for me thank you for watching you ",

        "Transcript": "hello today i will show you how to do a lace fabric let's learn how to do it i'm going to have this lace fabric in the end so before that let's just make a black shirt and then we will reproduce the lace sleeves now i have my glow window open and i am going to add a female avatar to my 3d window you can find it on the library in the case i am using a female avatar from the female v2 folder now i am going to select my patterns a dxf file and i am going to add them to my workspace as well you can double click on them and then press the ok button now i am going to organize the patterns first so here's the front the sleeves is going to be here and then the back here and the collar on top i am going to cut the front and back patterns in the middle in the base lines we have for that let's try the trace tool you can find it in the 2d window toolbar with this tool now we can do a right click on the line and select cut i'm going to do this for the front pattern and now for the back pattern now we select one side in both front and back patterns right click and delete so we remain with only one side to make the window a little wider i'll hide the library aside i'm going to use the free sewing tool and then let's start sewing first we can do the seam lines then the shoulders and the sleeve in the armhole we have to match the red notch we have from here to here and from here to the next red notch and then repeat this for every notch even here i am going to go to the notch not to the blue dot and this is it now i am going to duplicate my patterns with symmetry for that select a pattern with the transform pattern tool shortcut a i am going to select three patterns so front back and the sleeve while leaving the two other patterns then right click on top of one of them and select symmetric pattern with sewing now everything i do on one side is going to be automatically done in the other side i am going to sew the center lines for the front and back patterns so select segment sewing tool n and i am going to do one click one click and the same for the back now we need to sew the color pattern pieces to the reference lines we have in the main patterns so to be able to sew them before we need to activate these bass lines and for that we can use the trace tool so i'm going to select the trace tool shortcut i select the baseline we want to activate and press enter then we will have an internal line instead because the symmetric pattern is applied you only need to activate the baseline on one side only so we do this for the front and the back and now we can select free sewing tool m and we can start sewing everything together select the edit sewing tool to select all the sewings we just did for the color and then in the property editor change the line type to turn the reason we need to do this is that if we don't change the turned line type there is going to be a gap between the layers in the case of a seam line that overlaps two patterns together you should always change the sewing line type to turn so here this sewing line and all these sewing lines need to be in turn now i'm going to sew the inner line to the baseline we just activate it and for that i am going to use the segment sewing tool and also in this case when we saw something to an internal line the sewing line type is always going to be automatically interned so we don't need to modify it in this case now i'm going to repeat for the back pattern what i did in the front and then change again the sewing line type to turn for all of the sewing lines once all the sewing work is done i'll try to place all the patterns correctly around the avatar in the 3d window the shortcut too is going to place the avatar on the center of the window now with reset 2d arrangement all tool that you can find in the 3d window toolbar we can organize all of the patterns automatically in the 3d window as we have them in the 2d window just like this since the patterns should not cover the the arrangement points all over the avatar before we work with them i'm going to select select move tool press ctrl a all the patterns will be selected and then move them up so i get a clear view of the avatar in the display menu in the 3d window select show arrangement points i will be selecting the patterns in the 2d window i'm going to select one only one front pattern because of the linked editing and i am going to click on the arrangement point that is working for this pattern now i'm going to do the same for the back and for the sleeve for which i need a side view of the avatar for the patterns of the color what i need is to select them do right click on them in the 3d window and select superimpose under because i want them to be placed inside of my shirt now i can go to the display menu and deactivate show arrangement points and now we can simulate with the space tab we are going to have this in the end and for that we are going to apply a fabric and change the color if i go to library i already have my black fabric which i am going to apply by double clicking on it or selecting it from the library and dragging it into the garment i can also drag and drop it to the object browser and then if you simulate the fabric will change of shape on the front pattern i am going to merge the pattern center lines with the edit pattern tool i do a right click on one of the lines and then i select merge now i can simulate again i'm going to do the same for the back and simulate again now what i'm going to do is i'm going to change the pose of the avatar i go to my library to the avatar folder female v2 and then i search for post folder in here i'm going to select attention pose by double clicking on it i am going to select all the patterns in the 2d window and then go to the property editor to decrease the particular distance from 20 to 5. now we can simulate again the view of the internal lines and baselines in the 3d window is activated if you don't want to see them you can deactivate the view of both in the display menu in the 3d window then it looks good and now we are going to do the lace but before doing something like texture on a fabric or a top stitch it is good to complete all the simulation so with high resolution garment i am going to try to increase the resolution of the garment you can click ok the simulation starts and when nothing else changes anymore you can click to turn off the simulation to express the lace in claw the first thing we can do is use an image with no background for that we need to make the image transparent to have the texture of the lace you want you can take a picture using a scanner or a camera in order to cut out the background of the lace we need a contrasted color between the lace and the background i am going to open my file in photoshop once i have it here i can arrange my layers and we can use the color range function that you can find on the top menu select select color range from the main menu and use the eye dropper to click once on the background and then you can adjust how many color values need to be selected i've selected all the backgrounds and now i can delete it so press the ok button and then delete on the keyboard since we want to express transparency we must save this file as a png file now after saving the image file i am going to open it in cloud now we want to apply this image in our sleeves to make the shirt look like this i am going to open my library and search for the png file i just saved we need to select both slips so if transform tool pattern select while holding shift both patterns press assign to add a new fabric to the sleeve patterns drag and drop the png texture file you can also import textures directly here just drag and drop if i select edit texture tool in the 3d window toolbar i can relocate scale and rotate the lace textures as i like now we have completed our laced shirt if you have any further questions please comment below and thank you for watching you ",

        "Transcript": "hello and welcome to this tutorial video about how to tie a pattern we will start by adding a garment to our scene that has no knot and we may make pattern changes so that we can apply the not so open your library in my case in my material tab i have already prepared a project file and as you can see the project is already simulated on the avatar double click on the project file to load the file and you will see that is already a complete outfit also if you rotate around your garment you get an impression of how it's set up and what we would like to do is we would like to manipulate the file and the pattern so that we can achieve this effect that we can see here on the image so let's start i will start by making changes to the pattern in 2d in order to be able to tie the knot before we start let me close the library as your works surface will become bigger through this then we want to extend the hem part of the front panels and in order to do so we will have to add a point on the hemline that we can later on drag down so i will choose the add point split line tool shortcut x and then hover over the line you see there's numbers indicating how you're gonna split the distance but for us it doesn't matter as we then gonna drag it down so just click anywhere and the next step now we want to move this point downwards so we will have to switch to tool and we will select the edit pattern tool shortcut set select the point and then drag it downwards in order to change the straight lines now to more curved shape we will have to switch the tool to the edit curve point tool with this tool you can click on a line and you can create a curve point the curve point are the red points that you now see on the pattern outlines and then you can drag and drop this point to the desired location so first of all click on the pattern outline and now move it and now you can do the same thing for the second line now after adjusting the pattern it's a little bit distorted this will be solved later we would like to freeze the rest of the pattern pieces as we're only working with the front panels so for this i will now choose the transform pattern tool and with the help of this tool i can now select all pattern pieces except the front panels draw a box around all pattern pieces and with shift press down i can deselect the ones that i don't want to freeze i right click on one of the selected pattern pieces and choose the freeze command in the right click menu while rotating around you can see that the back and the sleeves have been frozen and we can now work with the front there is still some adjustments that we can do to make the simulation easier as you can see on the top left the simulation quality is still set to fitting complete and when this is selected it is so to say at the high resolution level and we can change it now back to normal when you now select both of the front panels with shift press down and we go to the property editor then we can see that the particle distance is currently set to 5. this is because with a dense mesh it's easier that the pieces don't get stuck in each other but it is also slower so now for our first work process and the simulation we would like to make use of the speed and therefore we will set it up to 15. so once you have set the particle distance to 15 start the simulation by clicking on the arrow or hitting the space bar and you will see that the pieces nicely come out of the legs from the outer now we can see the changes we made to the pattern simulated in 3d and now when i zoom in i still want to make some additional changes to the shape of the curve and i can do this by going back to my edit curve point tool that allows me to move the points and then also by clicking on another location i can add multiple points and by adding a few more points we can make this more natural and i will do this same procedure also for the pieces on the back you see you can add multiple points and thereby define the shape of your curve pretty precisely once you're happy with the result just hit the simulation button and see your results in 3d before we can start tying the knot we should still look at the properties of our pattern pieces in the property editor when you select both of the pattern pieces you will see that the collision of the selected pattern piece is still set to 1 when it is in high res mode so if the collision between two pattern pieces is set to such a low value it is very likely that the pattern pieces entangled themselves therefore it is recommended to change this to a higher value in our case we will now change it to 10 for the process while we're tying the knot after we have raised the collision to 10 we can now move on to the next step when we want to tie a knot we will use pins there's always two ways how to place pins on a pattern piece you can do it by using the pin box tool then you can drag open a box and select a larger area and fill it with pins the second option is that you stay in your select move tool and by holding down the w key on your keyboard you can click on a pattern piece and it will place the pin at the location where you clicked so it's recommended to use the pinbox tool if you want to fix larger amounts and move larger amounts or you can use the default tool and pairs down w if you only want to move points i will now delete the pins that i placed for this demonstration and you can do so by right clicking on one of your pins and you find two commands delete selected pin or delete all pins there is an even easier way so if you press ctrl and w you delete all pins by shortcut i will now continue with the select move tool and place the pins by using pressing down my w key and place the pin on both sides now it's important that the simulation is started and now you can move the pins around in the 3d window you can simply move a pin by using drag and drop but you can also make use of the gizmo normally for pattern pieces the gizmo never appears when you have the simulation turned on but for pins you will have the option to move pattern pieces with the gizmo as the pin is quite small it can be easier to use the yellow square to drag and move the point i will now use the blue axis to turn the pin outwards and then use the yellow square to raise one pin up to the hem level i will do the same now for the other side so move it outwards on the blue axis and use the yellow square to bring them up to almost equal height and by changing the view then moving it below the first pattern so that they overlap when i look at it from the top when looking at the current status it can sometimes be easier if the opening where you want to thread one of the fabric ends through is a bit bigger so what you can do here is you can create two pins on the left and on the right and with the help of the gizmo move them to the side so that it's easier to thread it through as a next step select one of the pins on the tip and rotate your view accordingly to bring it first downwards then look at it from the side move it backwards and then the goal is to bring it up again through the opening that you have just created just remember to adjust the view frequently and find the correct access on which to grab the gizmo once i have pulled up one end like this i can start to delete the pins on the sides by pressing down the w key on my keyboard it's just important that you click precisely on the pins so then they disappear and now as a next step try to pull the two ends away from each other so that you can at close the knot more tightly and this will always involve a bit of going back and forth pulling a bit on different ends but just try to adjust the knot nicely and tightly just also always make sure to not only check it from the front but also from the side that you can see that they're actually far apart from each other and then bring the pins also a bit closer to the body again when you zoom in a bit more closely and you already have a good result you can make it even more tight-knit by adding pins to the sides so once again if you press w and keep it pressed down you can click on a pattern piece and create a pin and you see that you can always pull a bit more we have a collision value set to one so there's little chance that they will sort of say interfere now when you look at the result that you've created you have now the first knot and we would like to add a second knot on top of that one so for the fine tuning we will deal with this later but first we will engage in doing the second knot so what i want to do now is i want to fix the area that i have already knotted so this area should be fixed and we can use the pin box tool for this to draw open a box and make sure it stays in place when we start the simulation select the tool draw open a box over this area you see the pins marked in orange appearing switch back to the select move tool and with w pressed down you can delete the single pins that we've placed before after this you do the same process one more time once you've tied the second knot just make sure to bring the pins a bit closer to the avatar and when you look at it from the front spread them out evenly and at the same height and try to now tighten the knot a bit more by pulling in order to simulate now the first knot we've created and the second knot together we will have to delete the pin area that we've placed so you do this by selecting it and right click delete selected pins and now if you want to tighten it a bit more you once again place pins to the right and to the left close to the knot by pressing down the w key and pull them a bit apart so this makes sure that everything is tightly connected and then as a next step we can delete the pins on the outer fringes when we have a look at our knot now we can see it looks still quite rough it's due to the fact that the particle distance is still uh quite high and you can also see that the collision is that we set to 10 millimeters is still causing like this gaps and we can basically look through the knot and now step by step we would like to enhance the quality of the garment so as a first step i will select both of my front pattern pieces and then lower the particle distance down to 5 just to increase the mesh density and quickly simulate to see the changes applied as we now want to tighten the knot a bit further i will also set pins closer to the net so on the left and on the right i with my w key pressed on i place a pin and with a w key pressed down i also delete the pins that's a bit further out now before i start the simulation i would like to decrease the collision that we have set from one millimeter to 10 millimeters at the very beginning and i will not go down directly from ten to one so i will go down in steps to avoid the pattern pieces so they clashing into each other and yeah in order to do so we will just select both of the front pattern pieces by holding down shift and then you find the additional thickness collision line in your property editor type in nine hit enter and then press the spacebar to start the simulation now we allow the two fabrics to come closer to each other stop the simulation again and lower it to the next value to eight same procedure again start the simulation and we will go on to seven when you now observe the process you will see that the holes are getting smaller so the knot gets tighter it's because we lowered the collision between the fabrics and you can always select the pins and also readjust them a bit so direct them to the side and say tighten your knot you can always add more pins when you think you need additional pins after you adjusted your knot once more i will now go back to lowering the collision down in one millimeter increments so i go to six millimeter i start the simulation let it sink as a next step i will go down to five millimeter and i will do this all the way down to three millimeter to make sure that the knot can really come closely together and when you hover around you will see that now there's almost no space between the knot and it looks already quite natural and now as next step i would select the pins and delete them or you just use the control w as a shortcut and you see that the edges cannot drape more naturally when you start the simulation and the fabric drapes there's also the risk that the knot will untie itself so i recommend with a w key pressed down to place pins in locations where you want to fix the knot permanently and then you just continue to start the simulation and let it sink and once it has draped and stopped moving too much you can then stop the simulation and normally we would work in a particle distance of five and that will be the final particle distance for a garment but in this case we want to have more defined wrinkles and really fine wrinkles so we can lower the particle distance of the pattern pieces that are connected to the knot even lower it will slow down the simulation so it's important to only lower it for the pattern pieces that is really necessary go to the property editor and lower the particle distance to 3 for example start the simulation and see the changes applied and now as the mesh has become even denser we can decrease the collision a bit further for a project like this with a knot you cannot directly change the collision in bigger steps so we will have to go in small steps downwards so i start with 2.5 simulate then as the next step 2 and then lower it to 1.5 which will be the final value for this knot now when you're zooming closer the knots are a lot tighter there is no space in between and it is also true that the pins are now hiding somewhere in the knot and you cannot see them so here use the shortcut ctrl w to delete the pins on the inside and start the simulation to simulate the drape of the knot once we have now completed the tying of the knot we can work on improving the whole completeness of the garment so normally i would always use the hi-res garment button open the dialog window by clicking on the icon and you want to change the simulation quality to fitting accurate fabric to get a more realistic drape of the fabric this can be done here in this menu but as you made many changes to the settings of your pattern pieces this can always be a bit risky so in this case i will choose the second way and i will change the simulation directly up at the simulation arrow and as we have now changed the simulation properties it is recommended to fix the area of the knot with the set of pins as it could otherwise untangle itself choose the pin box tool draw open your box and fix this area after the area is fixed start the simulation to apply the simulation properties and then stop again after you have seen that your fabric has re-draped right click on your pin area and delete it and you can switch back to the select move tool and we have now finished the process of creating a knot on our garments now as a last step we can now unfreeze the parts that we froze before and you could do this by simply clicking on each individual pattern piece but you can also use ctrl and a to select all pattern pieces right click on one of them and choose the unfreeze command in the right click menu and this will unfreeze all pattern pieces at once so now we've completed the garment thank you very much for watching this tutorial video and good luck with your project you ",
        "Summary": "# Comprehensive Guide to Tying a Knot in Pattern Design This guide provides a detailed step-by-step approach based on the tutorial transcript for tying a knot in a garment pattern design using a 3D simulation tool. The guide will cover definitions, necessary tools, and tips and tricks to enhance your workflow. ## Definitions - **Pattern Piece**: The individual sections of the garment that are designed and manipulated in the 2D view. - **Simulation**: The process of visualizing how the garment behaves in a 3D space, allowing you to see how the fabric drapes and interacts. - **Particle Distance**: A setting that defines the density of the mesh in the simulation; lower values create a more detailed mesh but may slow down the simulation. - **Collision**: A measure of how much space is allowed between pattern pieces during simulation to prevent them from intersecting. - **Pin**: A virtual tool used to fix a point in space on a pattern piece, allowing you to manipulate the fabric without it moving freely. ## Step-by-Step Instructions ### 1. Preparing the Scene - **Open Library**: Open your material library, and ensure you have a project file ready. Double-click the project file to load it. - **Inspect the Garment**: Rotate around the garment to understand its design and layout. ### 2. Modifying the Pattern - **Close the Library**: This will increase your workspace. - **Add Point on Hemline**: - Use the \"Add Point Split Line Tool\" (shortcut: **X**). - Click on the hemline to add a point. - **Drag Down Point**: - Switch to the \"Edit Pattern Tool\" (shortcut: **S**). - Select the point and drag it down to extend the hem. ### 3. Creating Curves - **Edit Curve Points**: - Switch to the \"Edit Curve Point Tool\" (shortcut: **C**). - Click on the line to add curve points (red points) and adjust them for a more natural shape. ### 4. Freezing Pattern Pieces - **Select and Freeze**: - Use the \"Transform Pattern Tool\" to select all pieces except the front panels. - Right-click on the selected pieces and choose \"Freeze\". ### 5. Adjusting Simulation Settings - **Set Simulation Quality**: Change the simulation quality from \"Fitting Complete\" to \"Normal\" for faster processing. - **Adjust Particle Distance**: - Select both front panels and change the particle distance to **15** for faster simulation. - **Start Simulation**: Click the arrow or press the space bar to see the changes. ### 6. Fine-Tuning the Pattern - **Adjust Curve Points**: Use the \"Edit Curve Point Tool\" to add and adjust additional curve points as needed. ### 7. Setting Collision - **Increase Collision**: Set collision to **10** to prevent entanglement during simulation. ### 8. Placing Pins for Knotting - **Pin Placement**: - Use the \"Pin Box Tool\" to place multiple pins, or hold down **W** to place individual pins on the pattern pieces. - **Adjust Pins**: Move and adjust the pins using the gizmo for precision. ### 9. Creating the Knot - **Threading**: Move the pins to thread one end of the fabric through the opening. - **Tightening the Knot**: Pull the two ends apart to tighten the knot. Adjust the pins as necessary. ### 10. Finalizing the Knot - **Remove Pins**: Use the shortcut **Ctrl + W** to delete unnecessary pins. - **Adjust Particle Distance**: To refine the knot, reduce the particle distance to **5** or lower for better detail. - **Lower Collision Gradually**: Decrease collision settings in small increments (e.g., to **9**, then **8**, etc.) to tighten the knot. ### 11. Completing the Garment - **Final Pin Placement**: Use pins to secure the knot if needed. - **Fix the Knot Area**: Use the \"Pin Box Tool\" to secure the area around the knot. - **Start Simulation Again**: Allow the fabric to drape and observe the results. ### 12. Unfreezing and Final Touches - **Unfreeze Pattern Pieces**: Select all pattern pieces (Ctrl + A), right-click, and choose \"Unfreeze\". - **Final Simulation Settings**: If necessary, adjust the simulation quality to \"Fitting Accurate Fabric\" for the final look. ## Tips and Tricks - **Use Keyboard Shortcuts**: Familiarize yourself with shortcuts to speed up your workflow (e.g., **S** for the Edit Pattern Tool, **C** for Edit Curve Point Tool). - **Work Incrementally**: Make small adjustments to collision and particle distance to avoid drastic changes that could disrupt the simulation. - **Check from Multiple Angles**: Regularly rotate your view to ensure that the knot and fabric look natural from all perspectives. - **Save Frequently**: Keep saving your progress to avoid losing any changes, especially after significant adjustments. By following these detailed steps and utilizing the definitions and tips provided, you can effectively tie a knot in your garment design and enhance your simulation skills. Good luck with your project!"

        "Transcript": "hi everyone today i'm going to work on a dress shirt pattern like the image shown here it is a design with buttons and a placket in this exercise you will import a pattern and an avatar and then place the patterns around the other tab before the sewing i'll just work in order so you can follow me step by step first i'll show the files that i added in the library and then we can start placing it around the avatar so your folder within the library you can see it here just connected it and can double click on it so i can load the dxf pattern file to work on today and the avatar to use is also in the avatar folder in the library i will bring up the version to female avatar in order to arrange the patterns nicely around it so this is what i'm going to do next we need to organize the patterns first set the front panel to fit the front panel based on the avatar shadow next the sleeve pattern i'll also arrange then the back seam patterns in order before i'm going to start with a simple sewing for this i'm going to select the segment sewing tool which would be shortcut n i just start connecting my side seams pay attention to my sewing direction then i connect the shoulder seams and i also can sew the sleeves along the side straight away and connect the sewing line between the yoke and the body on the back seam now we are going to sew the sleeve armhole we will connect the back seams first aligning them as a standard so based on these two notches align the notch to the sewing line and sew when the notch is enlarged it is cut in short proportions so pay attention and do not miss this part and of course i'm going to sew by aligning the direction of the sewing line now the upper part just like this and it's a two-piece connection so in this case the tool you're currently using can't be used as it is so press the segment sewing firmly change it to m to n segment sewing i'll press the tool and change it to m to n first of all set the sewing line of the segment to be n when you have all sewing lines set for m press enter on the keyboard then click on the segment which you want to be n and likewise when you completed the end sewing line press enter on your keyboard the same applies for the next step the next part from the shoulder seams towards the front again since this is a job that requires sewing one to one likewise it cannot be used only with the segment sewing tool this time it's not an end to end but a segment sewing tool so let's learn how to sew one by one using a shortcut key when changing the tool again select the tool hold it down and switch to the segment sewing tool and then first set the sewing line at the position to be the one sewing line where shorter parts will get connected to after setting one sewing line by clicking at it so come and move the cursor also if you press the shift key on the keyboard the color of the sewing line will change to a fluorescent color and then connect this sewing line with all according ones on your armhole just in line with the sewing machine notch and make a connection as when sewing if you let go of shift you can complete one or more sewing in the case of many too many you have to switch to the m2n sewing tool to work in case of one too many you don't have to change tools then the armhole is also aligned with the seam line you can connect according to the notch so now i'm going to sew the neck fit the center part on the back panel connect them side by side when i connect the rest of the front again the position that becomes one like this and here you can see that the front neckline is broken by many points so in this case first i click on the position of the sewing line 1 to set it hold shift and then move to the front by setting the sewing line you can easily manage one too many and connect then the remaining neck pattern on the back now let's work on the sleeves so first look inside the sleeve body as a baseline there is information about the design of this pattern so the baseline is the purple light colored line in the pattern not a line that can work on patterns separately so just think of it as if it were painted and to work with this line you have to select the trace tool which would be shortcut i because you need to change this line into an internal line so you can work on the pattern to convert baselines into internal lines use the trace tool shortcut i i'm going to use this tool to select the lines i want to make into the internal lines that i can use i can just select multiple lines all at once by pressing down shift and once i have selected them all i press enter on my keyboard so they will turn automatically into internal lines another option that i have could be also selecting more also here on this placket so i select again multiple baselines also here on the sleeve and on the placket and then i right mouse click so i get this drop down menu and can here select trace as internal line or shape first i'm going to make this tuck here in this leaf here it's shown what amount is folded into the baseline now the direction in which its folds is well marked so in this amount that folds over there i need to cut off the midpoint so now if you change the tool to edit pattern and make a selection you will see that the outline of the pattern is connected all the way around just like this this is because it's not separated by a straight point in this case you can then use the internal lines with their help you can create the point that cuts the segment exactly in the middle so select both ends of the internal lines that intersect with the pattern outline right click on the mouse and here you can select the menu to extend trim and add points to the outline of the pattern if you select the menu there it will also add a point at this location at the end of the internal line so if you check the pattern outline you will see it's divided in multiple segments so you can now draw another line at the midpoint on this line so we need to make a fold line between the two marked ones and in order to do this to break down the point in the middle of that segment here i'll select the add point tool at the top going to select that tool could also use shortcut x and if you right click on the line segment the split line window appears so you select the bottom menu here divide the quantity into two pieces if you click ok it's calculated into two segments with this same length because the point will break it in the middle and now i change the tool to internal polygon line tool shortcut g so if you click on the point you took and double click on the line segment and the end you can easily create an internal line in the middle that you can fold later on next i'm going to put the folded angle along the direction of the base lines here i'll quickly resize the window then the pleats fold tool will appear here on the top right so select this tool and create an arrow in the direction of the base lines on your pattern just like this click once to start the position and then move the mouse cursor like this to the right there is an arrow that gives you a preview of your direction of your future fold angles so i'll include all the internal lines and double click then my design is knife pleats here is a menu called number of internal lines per pleats that lets me decide how many internal lines will fit in one pleat it can also be displayed and since i drew three lines i now have to select three for this menu below you can set how smooth each fold is so usually 0 and 360 degrees are selected you can also choose an angle that is less flat of course and once i'm done with the folding angle i'll just sew the chuck below i will now change the tool to the free sewing tool the full angle here is on zero degrees which is shown in red and we are going to create a seam line where the red line is at this time the amount of pleats is not marked in the direction going to the left so first create a sewing line where you know the length so here i create the sewing line from one side towards the middle line and after that i will get the blue dot so i know how long i have to sew that piece down here towards the left when sewing one tuck like this the mound is based on this zero degree so you just have to work so that the two sewing lines face each other and take the 360 degree lines as a reference if you set two sewing lines like this so that the notch faces each other as much as the amount sewing for one chuck is then completed and since all the sewing lines just made are sewing lines where the pattern and the pattern overlap i'll use the edit sewing tool to edit the sewing line so you can use the edit sewing tool also shortcut b select all the sewing lines you just set up and set the sewing line type to turned you can find this function in the property editor and you need to change the part to turned if you don't do this it may be recognized as a seam that just sticks side by side in that case this tuck will not stick flat and the part where the sewing line is connected will float flat the sewing line that needs to be pressed flat on top of the pattern is exactly where the pattern overlaps i always select this with the edit sewing tool and change the sewing line type just like this to turned then this time i'll work on attaching the blackhead on the right side so if you take a look at the cuff pattern on the sleeve this cuff has two buttons a button and a buttonhole you can also see the location marked so because the button and buttonhole are locked and overlapped there must be a location where this pattern is open but it can overlap just like you can see here with these scissors so there is a baseline marked on but i will create a separate internal line that doesn't go just until the very top of this marking so i select the internal polygon line tool starting from the top where it opens up by clicking once then i'll go straight down the baseline and double click on the outside of the pattern and then i change the tool to edit pattern right mouse click on the internal line and then you can select cut from the menu so then this line is not connected to the outside of the pattern but it ends in the middle now i will try to sew the overlapping placket in here i will do so with changing to the segment sewing tool so first i will sew the placket from the outline just connect the notch to the sewing line so that the shape is exactly the same so now if the entire line is connected to the right side the meaning of creating a slit will disappear so i turn the tool into a free sewing tool then start my sewing line and will only sew to the position and set the length by matching the blue points there is one more location where this placket is sewn which is at the hem so if the hem is connected all the way it won't work to create a slit here so when i saw this placket onto my actual sleeve pattern i just need to make sure i connect only the part until the pattern cuts open also i do this again with the free sewing tool where i get the length first that i can use then here on my little placket pattern and connect the sewing line only until the blue dot also this pattern will later on be superimposed so that means it will lay on top of this leaf pattern which means i make sure i select all my sewing lines and make sure the sewing line type here again is set to turned which will just ensure my little placket pattern will just lay flat on that sleeve pattern just quickly again i'm in my edit sewing tool i make sure i have the right sewing line selected that will lay on top of each other later on go to my property editor and set it to turned in the next step i will connect my placket with my sleeve also the internal lines as you can see here and this ones are easy because they go just simply on top of each other and this one long line here that you can see which will also ensure that the slit will close i will use the 1 2 m sewing that we have seen before with pressing shift and attaching two short lines to one long sewing line the right side of this little placket i will leave open because later on this will be the end and also opening of the cuff at the same time so in the next step i can focus on sewing the cuff onto the actual sleeve pattern this is going to be a one-to-many seam because it's connected to this position all the way and from the location where the slit is located i will connect all the way except the overlapping sewing line just like here so you can see how i'm leaving out the tuck because this is the amount of fabric that will fold under the next part the remaining amount of the cuff will then meet at the side seam of the sleeve and return from the right side here just like that i'll draw this in orange so you can see it better so to sew this on i will use the free sewing tool shortcut m and then i start by clicking on the outer line until the first notch finish the line with the left click and what you can see marked here is in form of a baseline the position of the buttonhole which will always be on top when you close the cuff of a sleeve so this is why i will start the connection now sewing the cuff on and the first bit i have to attach is the little placket now i need to press shift to connect many sewing lines to one just like we did before on this leaf and then i will start here with the internal line marked for the position of the placket until the first line that marks the position of the tuck then i will leave out again as i already mentioned that amount of the tuck which will fold under continue at the third line which marks the last fold of my pleat and sew until the side seam of my sleeve as soon as i finished my sewing line i let go shift so the connection has been made and then i connect the remaining part of the cuff which will get sewn on to the right side of that sleeve pattern just like that with the free sewing tool as it's only one connection no need to press shift here and i finish with one click at the blue dot where my sleeve seam ends the rest of that sleeve i will finish later once i have arranged and placed it around my avatar and also in case i find that the library window here is narrowing down my view on my 3d space i can now either click on top of that library window to close that temporarily or i press shortcut y and now i will just start with the arrangement here i can use the transform pattern tool to also refine the arrangement in my 2d pattern window even a little bit more and if i want to reflect my layout of my 2d pattern window onto my 3d window i'll just press the button reset 2d arrangement all as soon as i press that you can see how it's reflecting perfectly the arrangement on my 3d window which i have on my 2d window and to get better view on the avatar i press ctrl a to select all patterns move them at the side and turn on the arrangement points i can find them either in a toggle bar or with shift f and now i can start placing my patterns by selecting one by clicking on it and then then i press on the arrangement point where i get the perfect preview for it and like this i place piece after piece here i'm adjusting the layout of my little placket pattern to my sleeve a little bit with my gismo and then place both of them around the arm of my avatar if you place it like this it won't be easy to select the arrangement point on the wrist so if you go down the menu on the bottom to the property window as it is the arrangement properties are shown so i'm going to adjust position y here then select the cuff pattern and click the arrangement point on the wrist to place it correctly then i press 8 on my keyboard to see the back view of the avatar here i can select the back panel patterns all at once and click on the arrangement point on the other half at this time the rear center is more deviated from the center of the arrangement points so again in the properties window you can adjust position x to move it a bit towards the avatar i'll push it a bit around and as the last step i'll place the collar stand and the collar pattern by clicking the arrangement point next to the avatar's neck the remaining space is also among the arrangement points on the back of the avatar so i'm going to pick the color and click on an arrangement point that's a little bit more outside just like this when placing the center of the selected pattern it will be positioned at the clicked arrangement point so therefore at this time it's a half pattern and again i adjust the position x in the properties window by turning this color a little bit around the neck once you have finished using the arrangement points you can turn off the view again and then continue with working on the shirt pattern i'm going to put the gusset attached to the side of the pattern here the notch is well marked so you can use it and i'm going to make an internal line to sew it on the inside here so if i select it with the edit pattern tool on the first notch position like this the point is well divided but the second one is not which i can see because the whole line is selected and in this case you can use the notch tool to make a straight line of the pattern so you select the notch tool and use it by right clicking on the notch there is a menu so select the notch tool right click on the notch here and then select add point to notch and if you select this on the pattern you can just add straight points everywhere you want to there is also no point for a lower notch on the front so likewise i select the add point to notch select the edit pattern tool again and now i'm going to make an internal line from the new segment that i have created here so here i have to see how far do i have to place this internal line which i can't know yet so i'll check the number the length of the top part of my gusset pattern and as i only need half here i'll enter half the value for the internal line so i right click on the newly created segment select the menu called offset as internal line and then once this info window puts up i put in a distance of six millimeters and important if extended is checked since the pattern extends beyond the length of the segment line i will uncheck the extend the same goes for the front panel so also here i will right click to set the internal line to be six millimeters distance from the pattern outline and then click ok the upper part of the gusset will also be sewn so this time i select the internal polygon line tool i click to start the straight line point based on the point at the top and then double click to finish the same goes for the other side and then i can start sewing the gusset on here i change to the segment sewing tool also here i will use the one too many sewing so i pay attention my sewing line notch is facing to the left which means i need to start at the front press shift attach the first top part of the gusset and then also the one at the back let go of shift and have it connected the sides of the gusset i can simply attach by one click on each segment and then this one is sewn on so before i continue with the sleeves here i will just finish the arrangement of the little gusset that we have just sewn and you can do this in the 3d window by just simply clicking on the pattern here so here i'm picking the transform pattern tool then i click in the 3d window on the pattern and set it to superimpose under which will help me to place that little pattern exactly underneath the sewing line where it belongs to then next we can take a look at this leaf and also if you want to control your views in 3d window you can always press on a pattern then click f on your keyboard and then you can zoom in directly on that point that you have clicked on then first adjust the position x of your cuff in the property editor so here you can directly go to the properties editor and adjust position x i'll adjust it according to the seam line so it matches where my slit opens and if you confirm this with the picking point coming out from the position you just clicked the click part is where the buttonhole is created that is when it's wrapped it should rise more outward so looking at the enclosed direction this part is more inward and in this case right clicking the pattern flip wrap direction you can flip the wrap direction and to make it more locked i'll adjust the spacing in the layout in the properties window and i want to reposition it and i'll make a button and a buttonhole here so i select the button tool at the top of the 3d window then click at the intersection of the two baselines where only the button is located and after selecting the buttonhole tool i will do the same i click at the intersection point on the other side to create a buttonhole the connection between button and buttonhole can be made by using the lock tool right on the top right of this menu so if you select the button first then the buttonhole you can set them to be locked that also is shown with a little lock on top of it and now we continue to work on the front panel so the front placket has a proportion that folds inward like this to be able to fold this placket i need to convert the base lines into internal lines first the one where i want to fold the placket and also the one where i want to attach it to to sew it on the inside so i press shift and select both of them at once just like this first the middle one and then the one where i want to sew it on then i press enter on my keyboard and have both of them connected into internal lines both at once so this pattern will get folded into the shape by selecting the fold arrangement tool up here then i click on the internal line in the middle which i have just created i can use my gizmo and then click and drag that fold around so the placket falls on the inside we only need to fold it in so it's flat enough but make sure it's not pointing outside and you can also hear by adjusting in the new check where they overlap and because these two lines overlap each other you can sew it just like when sewing pleats this one we will sew by using the free sewing tool based on the fold line also the same amount on both sides also the same position at the hem and because it has been folded already the outer pattern line will meet the internal line just like this i'll connect them as well here all the sewing we just did is overlapping sewing so at this time when sewing on the internal line the sewing line type is automatically turned and then you select only the two sewing lines sewn together with the added sewing tool on the top and the hem and change the sewing line type to turn here now in this state i'll first create a symmetrical pattern so i select the transform pattern and just draw a big box over my complete pattern or use the shortcut ctrl a and then i right click select the menu called symmetric pattern with sewing i'll get the yellow ghost that i can just position next to my pattern pieces in the 2d window by just simply clicking it and press shift so shift helps to organize it horizontally and as soon as i clicked i get a symmetric copy on the other side that now i need to just adjust slightly in the position with the help of my gizmo in the 3d window i'll move it horizontally so that it fits and in this case you just need to look at the position of the sleeves rather than the placket the back panel will be arranged in the pattern window so that the back panels can face each other and i can now complete the center back sewing i'll connect all the back panels center side by side using the segment sewing tool by simply clicking then i'll tidy up my front panel by changing to the select move tool because when worn the buttonhole is located on the outside that means in women's wear it's on the right side of the avatar on screen you see now the pattern is on the left and it will have to be more on the surface so i click this pattern pull it slightly out with the gizmo to the front and i also put it a bit more to the center to put the placket position on top of each other because when the buttons will be locked the simulation can be done correctly i'll now create a button and a buttonhole choosing the button tool i'll make a button with this pattern on the inside so i click on the intersection of the baseline to make a button you can also click on the bottom to make it and then you can easily copy and paste at once after changing the tool to the select move button tool click the first button and use the copy shortcut ctrl c and then if you press ctrl v a button to paste on the mouse cursor will follow now you can zoom in choose the right position and right mouse click because then this pop-up window appears and the first button you clicked on the first time will give you the position you can define the interval between the following buttons and also the number of buttons that you want to create in total i'll put in to create four more and now the gap between the first and the second button is replicated along this placket then i'll make a buttonhole in the symmetrical position so you can copy and paste using the buttonhole tool in the same way there's but also an easier way to do it when there's a symmetrical pattern so if you select the created buttons all at once and then right click on them you get this menu and you can select duplicate as buttonhole to symmetric pattern that's why i paste it with a buttonhole instead of a button in a symmetrical pattern so the baseline position is the same and the position is also well aligned to the center of the placket if you lock it here it will be completed but there is one more task that needs to be done so the front plaquette is double layered with a folded position so in this case it will be the same like in reality but whether it's a button or a buttonhole when there is an overlapping pattern it should be stick together so you can do the same in chloe likewise with the select move tool we can use it to select both buttons and buttonholes all at once right mouse click on the selected items and then set number of sewing layers and we can set the number of patterns to pierce together as two press enter so the centering is based on the overlapped position in 3d it will be an indication of where it will be pierced with and then it is complete now you can click and drag with the lock tool to select all buttons at once click on all buttonhole positions to lock all buttons with buttonholes properly and then this is completed let's change the tool back to the select move tool and then run the simulation you can also hit the space bar to simulate and as the base of this process is completed we can now take a look in adjusting the shirt in the simulation and enhancing the quality in our garment first i'll check if there are any parts of the sleeve or placket that are not properly before this i finish the locking sleeve up to the side but i didn't do the other side in this case you will need to correct it again and the gusset also needs some modification so stop the simulation simply press ctrl set on the keyboard to go back to the previous work and then select the button lock tool and lock up the according button and buttonhole and then re-simulate also checking in on the little gusset now here just like rotating around and looking it up here it seems to be okay on this side but still a bit mis-simulated on the other side so you can stop the simulation again and in the stopped state you can then just use the gizmo again to put the little gusset a bit more inside simulate again and with the use of this off and on simulation you can easily fix some minor simulation mistakes the other part seems to be well fitted also the placket so i'll try to close up the collar stand button of the neck pattern here in this case i will close it using the pin function with the select move tool i can then just click on the pattern by holding down w on the keyboard and a pin is simply created like this i click on this pin to make sure it's inward a button will then later be created in this location and then i take the other side and drag it a bit more to the right press the space bar to stop the simulation so now you can easily create a button on the side where the pin was created select the button create one by clicking on the placement on the collar stand here and then do the same for the buttonhole select the buttonhole tool and place it right where the position on the other side of the collar stand is then just lock button and buttonhole again by picking the lock tool and before we can simulate we need to do one more thing because it's important to remove that little pin so select move tool on the 3d window right mouse click on the pin and then you can say delete selected pin because otherwise the button simulation will get stuck where the pin is so now i press simulate and now i have a smooth simulation so now i will modify the buttons and the buttonholes a bit i'm going to modify the button and buttonhole items if you look at this baseline shape you will see that the button you created is much larger than the baseline so in this case after selecting the button tab in the object browser there is a default button and you can adjust the width on the button properties in the property editor for this exact eight item i entered about 10 randomly so it came out a bit similar if you want to do it correctly this internal line segment make the baseline an internal line and check the length or just keep going like this you can change the distance and find the same size of the marking if you want to then i'll fix the buttonhole also here i think i have to change the direction first before adjusting the size so the buttonholes are created basically always horizontally here it seems to be a vertical line so after selecting all the buttonholes with the select move tool i can change the angle of it in the property editor since it's laying horizontally i will enter an angle of 90 degrees to get a vertical state in this state select the buttonhole tab and click the default buttonhole item then just like before you can adjust the size here i'm entering a little bit lower value and now that seems much more fitting already the size has been adjusted similarly so you can adjust the angle on the collar stand here for the buttonhole just like you did before and as a next thing we can then take care of the whole collar and collar stand so first step i will change the tools again to the select move tool shortcut queue in my 3d window here i'm clicking on both color patterns and right mouse click to strengthen them i can also use the shortcut ctrl h then simulate and this will make your collar standing up more stiff stop the simulation again and with the edit pattern tool i select the pattern outline and create an according internal line that reflects the same shape of the selected pattern outline right mouse click offset as internal line and then i get a pop-up window where i enter a low distance just like here for example six millimeters that i can use to arrange a smooth fold to achieve a smooth fold we will again use the fold arrangement tool in our 3d menu by choosing the fold arrangement tool i can then click on the new created internal line and just simply fold my shirt collar downwards toward my garment and then simulate now the folded shape is nice and completed and in order to continue my work i will also first do some tidying up again in this case i will set my avatar into a clear position so i click on my library window or open it by shortcut y go into my avatar menu the corresponding folder for this will be within the avatar folder for the version 2 female avatar and then pause and you just have to choose the pose carefully if you want to see a larger thumbnail you can also click on the icon view here to get a bigger preview then i'll double click on the correct pose here and wait until it has finished the simulation simulate again for a perfect finish and then i will combine the work that has been divided in two parts on my back panel patterns here similar when using the edit pattern tool if you want to right click on the line where you want to merge you can just choose the menu and say merge for the pattern and the patterns that were divided into two will merge into one because there is no separate line in the back yoke i'm going to combine only the line segment with the other segment line here on the color stand then i continue with the lower back panel and then i go to the 3d window change the tool back to the select move tool simulate once again also here i can pull a bit on my sides to make the fit looking nice and correct then i stop the simulation now i'm going to align the shoulder position of this shirt according to the back panel of my back yoke pattern you can see the shoulder position here marked on as a baseline according also to the notch on the outside i use the trace tool shortcut i press enter to transfer it into an internal line so i can use it then i press 5 on my keyboard so i get the bird view on my avatar so i can basically look at my avatar's head and if you increase the size of the 3d window here you also can get a better view on your menu bar here you can find the avatar related tape tool so i will choose the linear avatar tape you can think of it as a linear line that you can mark the position on your avatar where your garment should be positioned and then attach it accordingly so you can draw the line by clicking once and double click to finish it on the shoulder repeat that process on the other side and in the next step we have to attach the internal line on our garment on the shirt back pattern to the line on the avatar with the attached to avartar tape so here the tool is in our 3d menu bar you can then first of all click on the internal line on the back yoke pattern and then you can see how it gets transparent in the 3d window and you can simply click on the linear tape that you have just created if you then do the simulation again the position will stick to that avatar tape here on the shoulder and the position of the whole shirt will be more balanced out according to the pattern indication that you got it still looks a bit pointy so then click the edit avatar tape tool again and now you can immediately remove these tapes again and when the simulation is on you can see how the drape just falls down more naturally then also change back to the select move tool turn around to check if your fit looks nice so now that i have the shoulder position corrected i'll try to improve the final finish and i can directly detect that that little gusset hasn't been simulated properly so i stop the simulation use my gizmo to pull it a bit more inwards of my pattern simulate again and like this i have easily corrected the little mistake coming to the end i'm going to use the high resolution garment tool at the top of the 3d window getting this input window here and by reducing the particle distance and particle spacing so the additional thickness collision between the garment the mesh will become more dense for a nice simulation the drape will be more natural and also in that state the thickness of the collision is lowered we will also lower the avatar skin offset to zero so the spacing between the garment and the avatar becomes more natural if you change the simulation quality to fitting and then press ok the complete garment simulates more accurate and also more realistically this needs a second to calculate this is also properties that also can be all changed by clicking on one pattern piece after another then the simulation tool changes to the fitting state by the arrows also turning red and if you run it again now it will yeah as mentioned look more realistic click again to stop the simulation and for the fine tuning i want to give the color and the color stand a little bit more stiffness so i select transform pattern and both my color patterns here then i move on to the property editor and here i can directly go to the drop down menu for bon skyff click on the little arrow on the left so the drop down menu opens up and then i tick on the box for bond just like this so both my patterns turn orange immediately which means diffusing or bonding now is applied and if we take a look at the folded line on the color here that we made before to actually fold it down we can see that it's still very sharp and in order to make this look more soft we can choose the edit pattern tool go to the pattern choose the line the internal line directly and then here take off the option for fold rendering so if we then simulate again we can see how that fold just drapes down more naturally again and simply looks more realistic next step to also get a nicer view of my whole completed garment i want to then change the view of my garment here in the little toggle bar for the garment view i will turn off the internal lines and then as soon as i turn around i can only see the fold here better as well also internal lines everywhere else have disappeared and now as soon as i click on that fold line again with edit pattern i can even adjust the fold angle to not be as sharp and to drape a bit softer then i will simulate again and see what kind of a different it makes for my outcome in the end that's a little fine-tuning here so whatever gives me the result that i'm aiming for so once the simulation has been completed i press the simulation tool again to turn it off so now when you look at the whole outfit turn it around in the view menu like the internal line i can also turn off the baseline view so to get an even cleaner view of my whole garment i can also turn off the trim view so i won't see my bond or fusing here so the orange will disappear and lastly the clothes now have a texture view that separates the outer and the inner surfaces so if you change this one to look at the thick texture surface you can see the original color on the outside and the inside and the thickness of the clothes can be seen as well so if i take a look at the whole garment now i like the dress shirt that i have completed after this date and i hope you enjoyed the session there's more videos in this intermediate course and see you next time you ",
        "Summary": "# Comprehensive Guide to Creating a Dress Shirt Pattern This guide outlines the step-by-step process of creating a dress shirt pattern using digital pattern-making software. It covers definitions, step-by-step instructions, and tips to enhance your workflow. ## Definitions - **Avatar**: A digital representation of a human figure used to visualize how garments fit. - **Pattern**: A template that provides the shape and dimensions of a garment. - **Placket**: A fold of fabric where buttons and buttonholes are placed, allowing for the opening and closing of a shirt. - **Gusset**: A triangular or diamond-shaped piece of fabric inserted into the seam of a garment to provide extra room. - **Sewing lines**: Lines that indicate where two pieces of fabric will be sewn together. - **Internal lines**: Lines within a pattern that are used for folds, seams, or other design elements. - **Segment sewing tool**: A tool used to connect two segments of fabric in the design software. - **Free sewing tool**: A tool used for more flexible sewing lines that are not strictly linear. - **Transform Pattern Tool**: A tool used to manipulate the position and orientation of patterns in the software. ## Step-by-Step Instructions ### Step 1: Import Files 1. **Open the Library**: Connect to your folder within the library. 2. **Load Patterns**: Double-click to load the DXF pattern file and the avatar (female version). 3. **Organize Patterns**: Position the front panel, sleeves, and back seams around the avatar. ### Step 2: Sewing the Basic Structure 1. **Select the Segment Sewing Tool**: Use shortcut 'N'. 2. **Connect Side Seams**: Pay attention to the sewing direction. 3. **Sew Shoulder Seams**: Connect shoulder seams. 4. **Sew Sleeves**: Attach sleeves along side seams. 5. **Connect Yoke and Body**: Sew together the yoke and body on the back seam. 6. **Sew Sleeve Armhole**: Align notches and sew. 7. **Use M to N Segment Sewing**: Change tools as needed to sew. ### Step 3: Create Internal Lines for Design Features 1. **Use Trace Tool**: Shortcut 'I' to convert baseline to internal lines. 2. **Select Internal Lines**: Select multiple lines using 'Shift' and press 'Enter'. 3. **Cut Midpoint**: Create fold lines and internal guidelines using the split line feature. ### Step 4: Create Pleats 1. **Select Pleats Fold Tool**: Create direction arrows for pleats. 2. **Set Number of Internal Lines**: Choose how many lines will be included in a pleat. 3. **Sew Tucks**: Use the Free Sewing Tool to connect tuck points. ### Step 5: Add Cuffs and Plackets 1. **Create Internal Line for Cuff**: Use the internal polygon line tool. 2. **Sew the Placket**: Use the segment sewing tool to connect placket sections. 3. **Adjust Cuff and Placket Position**: Ensure correct overlap for sewing. ### Step 6: Finalizing the Shirt Design 1. **Transform Patterns**: Use the Transform Pattern Tool to adjust the arrangement. 2. **Reflect Layouts**: Use the 'Reset 2D Arrangement All' to sync the 2D and 3D views. 3. **Adjust Positions**: Use arrangement points to position patterns accurately on the avatar. 4. **Add Gussets**: Attach gussets using internal lines and segment sewing. 5. **Create Button and Buttonholes**: Place buttons and holes where needed and lock them together. ### Step 7: Simulate and Final Adjustments 1. **Run Simulation**: Press space bar to check garment fit and drape. 2. **Modify Fit**: Use gizmo to adjust positions, particularly gussets and seams. 3. **Change Simulation Quality**: Adjust particle distance for more realistic draping. 4. **Check for Overlapping Patterns**: Ensure all layers are properly aligned. ### Step 8: Final Touches 1. **Adjust Button Sizes**: Modify button and buttonhole sizes in properties. 2. **Stiffen Collar and Cuff**: Use the \"Bond\" feature for added stiffness. 3. **Final Simulation**: Ensure everything drapes well and looks realistic. 4. **Clean Up Views**: Turn off internal and baseline views for clarity. 5. **Export or Save Your Work**: Make sure to save your pattern for future use. ## Tips and Tricks - **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Familiarize yourself with shortcuts (like 'N' for segment sewing, 'I' for trace tool) to speed up your workflow. - **Use Layers**: Keep different pattern pieces on separate layers for easier management. - **Simulate Often**: Regularly run simulations to check fit and drape as you work. - **Adjust Properties**: Don’t hesitate to adjust properties like spacing and angles to ensure accurate fitting. - **Save Versions**: Save different versions of your work to revert back if needed. - **Utilize the Gizmo**: Use the gizmo for precise adjustments in 3D space. By following this guide, you will be able to create a well-fitted and stylish dress shirt pattern efficiently using digital pattern-making tools. Happy sewing!"

        "Transcript": "hello everyone today we are going to learn how to create a pant in flow we're going to follow the process of adding in our avatar a claw avatar organizing our patterns and then adding the details to complete this pant so let's go into it the first step when starting this is of course to load in our avatar and load in our pattern pieces so here i have a file which is called library bands and i'm going to add in my avatar first here i'm adding in a mail avatar i'm simply double clicking and your avatar will be imported into your window next i'm going to add in the dxf pattern i already have present here simple add into my workspace and here i have my patterns in the 2d and 3d window now that all the patterns are in my window i'm going to begin arranging these patterns so that this makes it a little easier for me to sew starting of course with the front and back here i'm also going to arrange the pockets here on top and then lastly my waistband here i have matched the pattern so i can work with sewing quite easily so let's begin our sewing during any sort of sewing it is better to sew the larger part first and over here i am going to use free sewing once i select my free sewing tool i i'm going to start sewing the sides as you can see over here in this pattern there is a notch and you have to fit the notches together to sew it this small part is going to turn back so i will sew it only from here to the end now i'm going to go ahead and click the m to n free sewing tool and i'm going to use this tool to sort this side in the case of m to n sewing the order is very important both sides of the m to n will come from the top to the bottom so i begin from the start over here and once this is done i'm going to go ahead and press enter once you press enter you will be instructed to start the free sewing of the n side so there i am completing the end side of the sewing starting with that part of the pocket and then this part over here once this is completed i will press enter again and the sewing for m to n will be completed i'm going to continue sewing the other parts as well as you can see i'm placing that pattern right on top of it so it's easy to understand where each part has to get sewn this part will be my pocket so i'm sewing the sides together here it is important to note that since the pocket bag will be flat against the front pattern we will have to change the sewing line type as you can see over here we are going to learn all about the sewing line types whenever you do a normal sewing you can see it'll be shown as the first option that is flat over here whenever our basic default sewing is done it always gets sewn as flat but what we are looking for in the pocket since the pocket bag will be right behind the front pattern we want the pocket bag and the front pattern sewing line to be turned so here you can see we have the sewing line type and in the property editor you can see there is the option of sewing line time which i am just changing to turn here again for reference you can see when it is changed to turn both the pattern pieces will lie flat one on top of the other so in this case our pocket bag will lie flat right behind the front pattern so for any such sort of a pattern you have to change the sewing line type to turn now i am just going to go ahead and continue the rest of the sewing again using my free sewing tool i'm sewing from top to bottom over here like before i'm leaving that slight space at the hem because that would be turned go ahead and complete the rest of the sewing once this is done we are now going to focus on the pocket as you can see this pocket pack pattern is on fold so i'm going to sew both the sides and over here again i will change the sewing line type to turn you will understand this a lot more when we place these patterns around the avatar once all of this is done we are going to duplicate the patterns and then sew the waistband what i'm doing here is now i'm going to use the transform pattern tool and i'm going to select the patterns that i want to duplicate once you have selected all the patterns that you want to duplicate you simply right click and over here you have the option for symmetric pattern with sewing that is the shortcut of control plus d once this happens you will have the shadow of the other side of your patterns and you simply click i'm bringing the back patterns together so that this helps with the sewing once again i'm making sure the patterns are arranged in the 3d window as they are in the 2d and now i'm going to continue the sewing here i have the fly which i am sewing once this part is done you can see the other side of the pattern edge of the fly needs to be sewn to this line but right now on the pattern it is a baseline and we cannot sew anything to a baseline so i'm going to have to convert it to an internal line to do that i'm using the trace tool and i'm simply going to click on these baselines the baseline is divided into a number of different lines so i'm simply keeping shift pressed and clicking on it once this is done i press the enter button on the keyboard and this will turn the line into a red that means it's turned into an internal line now i can go ahead and sew this part once this is done you can see as per default the sewing line type will be turned this is because whenever you saw a pattern outline to an internal line the sewing line will always show as don't now i'm completing the sewing and you can see here i'm going to turn this as well once this is done i have a few more sewing lines to complete on the back now we are going to work on this fly pattern so to complete the rest of this pattern i am going to copy this fly pattern and to do so i am simply right clicking choosing the option copy and right click anywhere in the 2d window and paste this pattern this construction will become clearer to you when we do the arrangement of all of these patterns i am then sewing this one side and this part of my fly is now complete now we have the waistband part that is yet to be completed over here you can see that this denotes the center back of the waistband so i'm going to start the sewing from there and do the back first here i have one side of the back completed then the other and you will also get the dark blue dots to tell you the sewing line length now i'm going to complete the front the front here is going to be a little bit tricky because we have the pocket and the front pattern so i'm selecting m to n sewing first i select the waistband sewing and i'm pressing enter to complete the m sewing now to complete the end sewing i have to select part of the pocket and then the waistband so here i'm selecting one part of the pocket and then finish it off with the waistband and press enter once this is done i have one side of my front completed and i'm going to replicate it to the other side same process on the other side using m2n i select the waistband and press enter and over here now i'm going to select the pocket the front pattern and we are also going to select the fly pattern that we copied over here once this is done you go ahead and press enter again this will become much more clearer when we arrange the patterns once this is done i'm going to go on to free sewing and in free sewing i'm sewing this part of the pocket to the front pattern again we are changing it to turn since the pocket bag will be sitting right behind the front pattern as you can see i don't have to do the sewing twice because it will be duplicated on the other side since both of them are symmetric patterns now i have these pocket patterns that i have not yet sewn and i'm going to select them and deactivate the pocket and the loop patterns so right click and we have the option deactivate pattern only i will be deactivating these patterns because i am not sewing them right now i'm going to finish the basic pant patterns and then i will get on to sewing them i'm also going to select the reset 2d arrangement just so that all my patterns are set in the same way as my 2d window in my 3d window now we're gonna work on arranging the pattern pieces around our avatar so the first thing that we're gonna do over here is that all of these pattern pieces are right now in front of the avatar and we're gonna keep them a little bit away so we can work on it and before that we're gonna go ahead and switch on our arrangement points this will help us arrange our pattern pieces around our avatar with ease what i'm going to do is i'm going to select all of these patterns and i'm going to move them up with the help of my gizmodo once that's done and all the patterns are out of your way i'm using the number 2 on my keyboard which is the shortcut for the front view of the avatar and i'm going to select the front band pattern and place it over there with my arrangement points now i'm using the number key 8 for the back view and i'm doing the same but i'm keeping shift press to select both the back patterns next we have our waistband so you're again placing the waistband along here now i've placed the pocket and once the pocket is placed since i need the pocket to be behind i'm looking at the property editor section that says arrangement and i'm going to change the offset so that my pant pattern is towards the front lastly we need to fold this pattern piece of the pocket so i'm using the trace tool and selecting that line and pressing enter to create it into an internal line once that's done we're using the fold arrangement tool to fold the pocket so you simply select it and once you get the gizmo tool you can move that and fold the pocket like so once this is done we need to place the fly patterns so i'm going to right click on the fly pattern in the 3d window and you have the option to superimpose under when i choose the option to superimpose under you will see that the fly pattern will be right behind the front pant pattern so this will help with the arrangement next i'm going to superimpose side for this other pattern here with the gizmo tool i'm just bringing it out and over here i'm also going to complete the sewing this side so you can see all the sewing lines as well this pattern might also be a little stretched out but that is because it is also sewn to the top waistband and the superimpose is dependent on the sewing here i'm also changing the offset of the waistband this will help in the simulation i am going to sew this part of the waistband here so i'm using the trace tool to create that into an internal line and now i'm going to sew the edges of the waistband together this will help with the simulation process as well lastly i'm moving the pockets below now let's adjust the garment in the simulation once it's complete so i'm going to switch on simulation by pressing the space bar on my keyboard and you can see the garment has simulated there's one part of the sewing that is incomplete so i'm going to do that right now once this is done just simulate again you can see there's a slight collision happening over here so i'm simply going to bring the front pant pattern ahead and i'm pressing the 2 key on my keyboard to get the front view and i'm selecting all the patterns and with the gizmo tool i'm going to move them a little higher so the waistband sits at the correct position once simulation is done you can see the waistband is sitting much better now we are going to work on the hem of the pant to work on the hem of the pant i need an internal line that is the exact distance from the hem on the top so i can create a fold to do that i'm using going to use the edit pattern tool and when i right click i get the option offset as an internal line i'm going to use that right now and create an internal line that is the same distance from that as you can see here you have a line i'm going to sew it and now with the fold arrangement tool i can fold it to create my hem i'm also going to sew the sides i'm doing this with the free sewing tool and i'm making sure to change the seam line type to turn since they will be folding it will be right against each other which is why we set the same line type to turn i'm following the same process on the other side of the band as well this is on the back and don't forget to change the seam line type to turn for the edges once this is done i'm using the fold arrangement tool to fold them to the inside once this is done you can go ahead and simulate and you have your hem done now let's work on the pocket to make sure my pocket is adjusted properly i'm hiding the 3d pattern that is the front pant pattern now while keeping simulation on i'm just pulling this to make sure the pocket is simulated correctly now selecting the pant pattern in the 2d window you will get the gizmo in the 3d once i right click on it it will give me the option to show the 3d pattern again this will make sure my pocket is simulated correctly and there is no collision on it i am now going to strengthen all of these patterns just to make sure there is no collision and the pant is fitted correctly this is a good trick to use if you feel that there is some collision that you cannot see and now i'm going to unstrengthen it now we are going to start with these small pocket patterns and the loop pattern that we had deactivated earlier i am activating them right now over here it is important to note where the patterns need to be placed on the front you can see the pocket pattern needs to be placed between two other patterns and on the back it needs to be placed on top of the back pant pattern here i am going to now change the base lines into internal lines so that i can sew my pockets over here i'm going to use my trace tool and keeping shift pressed i am selecting the outline of this pocket after that i will press enter to convert it to an internal line once this is done we are going to go ahead and sew the pocket i am using the free sewing tool over here we're going to do the same to the back pocket i'm using the trace tool and while keeping shift pressed i'm selecting the outer baselines that will form my pocket i'm then going to press enter to convert it to an internal line and now i'm going to use the free sewing tool to go ahead and sew up the pocket you can see that since i have sewn one pocket the other will automatically get sewn because they're symmetrical now i'm selecting these pockets and i'm using the shortcut of super impose over since this pocket pattern is going to be placed between two patterns i'm selecting the front pant pattern and with the gizmo tool slightly bringing it out the back pocket is fine as it is once this is done we switch on simulation and check if it has simulated correctly now we are going to work on the loops of the pant for this you can see that one side is going to be attached to the pattern outline and the other side as usual is on a baseline i'm using the trace tool pressing enter to convert it to an internal line and the same for the back since the patterns are symmetrical you will have to do it only for one side now we are going to go ahead and start sewing these loops since we have only one loop pattern we are going to need to copy and paste it to create more for that i am using ctrl c and then ctrl v and right clicking to get this popup box to select the amount of loops i want to create now that we have all the loop patterns created we're going to go ahead and start sewing them i'm using the free sewing tool here sewing the top part to the belt first and then to its corresponding part on the band always make sure to use the sewing tool first on the belt loops and then on the belt pattern or the pant pattern this will give you the dark blue dot that will tell you the exact measurement of sewing that you have completed now that all the sewing is completed i'm selecting all the pant loops and here i've shown the mesh of the loop and you can see since it's a small pattern a 20 particle distance is too much so what we are going to do is we are going to select all of these belt loop patterns and i am going to change the particle distance to 5. this will help in simulation as well now with all the pattern loops selected i'm going to use super impose over and you can see they will be placed according to the sewing lines once simulation is on you can see the pattern loops are placed correctly now we're going to work into applying our fabric and changing our avatar pose the first thing that we can do is change the pose and in library and in library avatar section you'll see there's a folder called pose if you click on it you'll see that there are a number of poses and when you double click you'll get the option to add the post to the existing avatar here i've changed the avatar pose so the hands come lower and now we're going to add in a fabric i already have a denim fabric here which i'm simply going to drag and drop and you can see now that the denim fabric has been applied to my pant i'm selecting the belt and the belt loops   and here in the property editor i'm looking for the option for adding bond to this belt pattern here we have the option of bond which i'm going to take so it switches on and now i'm selecting all the patterns and simulating the pant again while using the gizmo tool to lift it up now we are going to work on the top stitches and the trims yeah i'm making sure my baselines and internal lines are not visible anymore and you can see here that there are a number of top stitches in this render which i am also going to add into our pant here i'm using the top stitch tool and i'm going to use the section of free top stitch and i'm going to go ahead and add top stitches to my pocket as soon as i completed you can see there's a white top stitch added i'm going to change this default white top stitch and make it more suitable for a denim so here i am changing the spi i'm also going to go ahead and change the color and i'm increasing the number of top stitch lines to two now i'm adding top stitch to the back band and the front pocket section now to the front pant pattern the side seam now i'm going ahead and adding top stitches to the belt pattern as well as the belt loops to add it to a complete shape on all four sides you just need to double click on one of the corners of the pattern as i am doing here now we are going to add in top stitch to the hem and we also need to add top stitch to the fly over here since the patterns are symmetrical as soon as i add top stitch to one side it will be replicated to the other so for that we need to take off the symmetry between both the patterns i am simply selecting both the patterns and on right clicking in the 2d window we get the option to remove linked editing now both the patterns will not be symmetrical so when i add in top stitch to one pattern it won't be replicated on the other i'm using the edit top stitch to delete both the top stitches and now with the free top stitch i've added to only one side of the pattern we need to follow the same process here at the back so i'm clicking on them right click remove linked editing and now adding the top stitch here once this is done we now lastly need to add the button and the button hole to do that we have the baseline that is the guideline markers here so i'm going to use here my buttonhole tool and i simply need to left click once to add in my buttonhole i'm going to do the same for the other side of the belt and add in my button with my button too here we have the default button and buttonhole added and now i'm going to fasten the button simply using the fasten button tool i click once drag and click it to the buttonhole and now my button is fastened i'm selecting the button and i'm changing the default button to another one here we have a basic cloud default library so you can go ahead and customize your button as you like i'm also changing the fabric to metal and i'm going to go ahead and change the color once i'm happy with the color i can simply click ok i'm also customizing the buttonhole and now that this is done we need to add rivets to the pocket over here on the front so i'm going to add in a button here that is a default button and i'm going to add those here on my pocket of course i'm going to customize this to create the rivets and i'm making sure the size is small changing it to metal that is a metallic fabric and changing the color to the same color that i used on the center front button once i've added all the buttons i need to i'm making sure the fabric that i can see in my 3d window is double sided that is a thick textured surface and i'm now selecting the belt and the belt loops and i'm increasing the thickness render to one this will make my fabric a little thicker now let's work on enhancing the quality of this garment to do so we are going to use a high res garment option which essentially will decrease the particle distance and it will change the additional thickness collision you can also see the options of skin offset that will be changed here as well this will essentially make your garment a high resolution garment once you select ok you will see your simulation will change over here and it will simulate according to the actual fabric properties once this is done you'll have a hi-res denim garment ready here you can view it in the render window hope this tutorial was helpful thank you everyone ",
        "Summary": "# Comprehensive Guide to Creating Pants in CLO 3D This guide will take you through the process of creating a pair of pants using CLO 3D, including step-by-step instructions, definitions of key terms, and helpful tips and tricks. ## Overview of the Process 1. **Load Avatar and Patterns** 2. **Organize Patterns** 3. **Sewing Process** 4. **Adjusting Patterns for Simulation** 5. **Adding Fabric and Details** 6. **Final Adjustments and Rendering** --- ### Step 1: Load Avatar and Patterns #### **Instructions:** 1. Open CLO 3D. 2. Load your avatar: - Go to the file containing your avatar (e.g., \"library bands\"). - Double-click to import a male avatar into your workspace. 3. Import your DXF pattern: - Use the import function to add your pattern pieces (front, back, pockets, waistband) to the 2D and 3D windows. #### **Definitions:** - **Avatar**: A 3D model representing a human figure used for garment fitting and simulation. - **DXF Pattern**: A digital file format used for 2D and 3D design data interchange. --- ### Step 2: Organize Patterns #### **Instructions:** 1. Arrange the pattern pieces in the 2D window for easy sewing: - Place the front and back pieces together. - Stack the pockets on top of the respective front pieces. - Position the waistband above the patterns. #### **Tips:** - Always ensure that notches are aligned for accurate sewing. --- ### Step 3: Sewing Process #### **Instructions:** 1. **Free Sewing**: - Select the free sewing tool. - Begin sewing larger parts first (e.g., sides of the pants). - Align notches and sew from M to N, ensuring you start from the top to the bottom. - Press enter to complete each sewing line. 2. **Change Sewing Line Types**: - For pocket bags that will lay flat against the front pattern, change the sewing line type to \"Turn\" in the property editor. #### **Definitions:** - **Free Sewing Tool**: A tool in CLO 3D that allows for flexible sewing options between pattern pieces. - **Sewing Line Type**: Defines how pattern pieces will be sewn together (e.g., flat, turn). #### **Tips:** - Always change the sewing line type to \"Turn\" for pockets to ensure proper folding. --- ### Step 4: Adjusting Patterns for Simulation #### **Instructions:** 1. Use the **Transform Pattern Tool** to duplicate patterns for symmetry (Control + D). 2. Sew the waistband and pockets, ensuring to use the **Trace Tool** to convert baselines to internal lines where necessary. 3. Superimpose patterns as needed to ensure proper arrangement in the 3D window. #### **Tips:** - Use the **Reset 2D Arrangement** to align your patterns consistently in both 2D and 3D views. --- ### Step 5: Adding Fabric and Details #### **Instructions:** 1. Switch on simulation (Spacebar) to check the fit. 2. Apply fabric: - Drag and drop your preferred fabric (e.g., denim) onto the patterns. 3. Add top stitches using the **Top Stitch Tool**: - Select the free top stitch option and adjust the stitch settings (color, SPI). #### **Definitions:** - **Top Stitch**: A decorative or functional stitch that is visible on the outside of the garment. #### **Tips:** - Adjust the particle distance settings for smaller patterns (e.g., belt loops) to improve simulation quality. --- ### Step 6: Final Adjustments and Rendering #### **Instructions:** 1. Add buttons and buttonholes using the respective tools. 2. Customize buttons and rivets by adjusting size, fabric type, and color. 3. Enhance the garment quality using the **High Res Garment Option** to reduce particle distance and increase thickness. #### **Tips:** - Always check for collisions during simulation and adjust pattern placements as necessary. - Use the **Gizmo Tool** for precise adjustments of pattern positions. --- ### Conclusion This guide provides a detailed walkthrough for creating pants in CLO 3D.

        "Transcript": "welcome back to the perfect rush of part 2. so make sure you already download the factory folder inside the folder we have folder a and b double click to open folder a and you will see complete and practice so if you want to check the final results you can open complete and to start hold your left key and then drag and drop this file to the 3d window next we will need to draw a circle in the 2d pattern window so to do this we need to hold down the polygon button and then choose ellipse or use a shortcut e then left click to open the create ellipse window and then change the diameter to 10 for width and height and then click ok here we need to assign new fabric to the circle so to do this we need to use transform pattern zoom in and then right click choose assign to new topic use transform pattern to select the circle and then scroll down in the property editor and then change the pattern distance to 0.8 millimeter and change the additional thickness rendering to 100 next we will check the circle in 3d window so it looks thicker because we increase the value for the additional thickness rendering so make sure you are selecting it and then we will need to export it as a obj file so click file export obj selected and then choose the correct export options so we will choose single object bake and then the scale will be in millimeter and then click ok to confirm so after we export the obj we can delete the pattern select and delete and then we will click file choose import ad obj so you will find the obj in the same folder open the load type should be add and then the object type please choose to trim and the scale should be 40 and then we can click ok to confirm the next step we need to glue this obj to the tip of the hat so to do that we need to click this blue icon and then left click again to place it at the tip so if necessary we can rotate the obj a little bit and use the yellow square to adjust the position and we will need to double check the obj weight so select and then go to the property editor so you can see the weight is 72 something gram now so it's too heavy so we need to change the number to two to make sure it is not too heavy when you turn on the simulation okay we can turn on the simulation and then interact the pattern and then see how it reacts so it looks quite nice in terms of the position and the scale okay so we can turn off the simulation now okay so now we will move on to the render click render and then choose the first one so now we are just going to preview the fur result so we can click this image and medial properties and then make sure the image size and resolution are not too high and then we can click the interactive render so we need to change the pom-pom material to fur and we can zoom in to preview it clearly and then select this obj and we will choose the material type to fir so you can see fur is only can be previewed in render window now the preview is showing the further results and we can see that we need to change the length because now it's too long okay so you can find length under the base change 50 to 10. and we want to lower the value for the grossiness so we will change to zero and we want it looks less soft to give a more synthetic feeling so i will change the value to 0 for softness as well also i will change the thickness to 0.8 and then 0.15 so you can keep adjusting the value until you get the ideal results and this is what i want after we finish making the pom pom we can stop the render and then we can zoom out to show the whole christmas hat now we are going to change this string to firm material okay so let's open fabric folder in curl library so duplicate and then type fur in the searching bar so you can choose one of the fur fabric to to the object browser so i will choose this one hold my left key and then drop to the thumbnail so as we are still selecting the obj we can't see the properties of this fur fabric so we need to select and then the first thing we need to change the color to white so click the color chips and then choose white okay and we need to double check the back and side as well so click back and then the type is matte which is okay because we are not showing the backside so we don't need to study as far and color change the color to white side we need to change the size to fur and then set the same options and the same value as front but we can also check this box in order to use the same material as front okay so we can turn on the interactive render again and then the next step is we are going to adjust the fur detail value to have a better appearance we will keep the interact rendering on and then we will start to change the parameters so first of all we will change length to eight millimeter okay so the fur looks shorter and then thickness 0.7 then 0.8 and then grossing this will keep both crossing this value as zero and the softness one after we finish we can zoom in and then rotate the avatar to check and it looks better than before so this is the first tree for the christmas hat now we move on to the next step we will learn how to create custom bits first we will need to close the render window and then we need to create a new fabric here click add to create choose the new fabric fabric one and then choose rectangle 2 here and then left click to open the create rectangle window insert the measurement 13 millimeter for width and 30 for height as well and then click ok to convert next we will need to choose edit pattern and then right click on the outline choose split in order to add a middle point on the outline we need to choose uniform split and then the number of segments should be 2 so we will have 2 segments in the same length click ok to confirm and then we will do the same for the other outline right click split choose uniform split the number of segments two okay so now we have two middle points on the outlines then we will use base two to draw base lines choose base polygon and then left click to start drawing the baseline and then double click to stop at this corner then do the same for this corner so left click to start drawing and then move the line to the same corner double click to cut the line and then we will draw the final baseline double click to end so we will have three base lines in total according to our looks we need to use edit pattern to drag the points downward so the first one we need to drag it by nine millimeters and then we need to drag the other one by eight millimeters and then nine millimeters again and then choose edit pattern and then hold your left key to drag the pawn right click to get the moving distance box then we will type 9 millimeters for the distance moved and then we will do the same for the next pawn hold your left key drag right click this time eight millimeters and then the final pawn also hold your left key to drag and then right click nine millimeters now we can unfold the outline to complete the star shape so right click choose unfold then we can delete the middle point and then right click and fold again then we will need to lower the curvature value to 10 and the product distance to 0.8 millimeter also we will need to increase the thickness rendering value to 1.5 millimeter now we can zoom out and then focus on the star pattern you can even press f key to focus and then we can rotate to the side view a little bit and then we can follow the looks to change the curvature percentage to 10 so you can see the edge becomes sharper and crispy then we will lower the pilot distance to 0.8 and increase the thickness rendering to 1.5 millimeters and then we will export the pattern as obj so click to select and then choose file export obj selected then we can choose the correct options single object and then choose fake and then we will choose the same file option saved with absolute texture image file path click ok to confirm now you can find the star beat obj in the folder now we need to create a thumbnail for the b so select the b and then rotate to the front right click and then choose format 3d background so let's choose solid fill and then select gray as the background click ok to control and then we will use a image capture tool so open it and then click new so we can capture in the 3d window and then we will right click and then save it as the thumbnail so select the correct file path and then rename this image and make sure you save it as jpeg okay then click save okay we can right click the background format 3d background and then choose picture or texture flare again to convert back to the original background and then we can select and delete the pattern press to to go back to the front view and then we will click file import add obj to add this star bit to the 3d window so we can keep the options like this so we don't need to change anything specifically for the export options first select the star and then zoom in and then we will use the visible tube to rotate the star hold your shift key to rotate and then show the gist mode tool again and then use the green arrow to adjust the position make sure it is touching the 3d grid and we can press 0 the number 0 key to see the bottom view and then adjust it again make sure the center of the star is matching the intersecting part of the 3d grip okay keep adjusting and make sure the star is not underneath the greedy grid is above the 3d grid zoom into double check okay so i think it's ready to export again so click file export obj selected and then we will click the original one to override it save so we will replace the old one so we will get the same options to select before the exportation and this time we need to open up the select all operators options and we need to choose this one because we are going to export this obj again okay so we can click ok now we can register this study we will go to button page in the object browser select this default button and then we will click this cross icon so we will rename it as star b and then we will choose the correct obj and we will also add the thumbnail to register this custom button click ok and then the information window will shows we are already registered this star bit as a button after exporting the obj again we can delete the original one so click and then press dedicate to delete then press number two key go back to the front view now we can zoom in the christmas head you can enlarge the video window a little bit and then choose the bottom page now the button already changed to start need as the one we registered so to add we can use button two we just need to left click to add and then we can use select move button to adjust its placement or we can do the same in 2d meter we can adjust the angle to make the rotation we can select the button and we can change the width value to a smaller size so i type 15 millimeters to make it smaller and we can also change the material type for example battle so it will become a metallic e so i will use button 2 again left click on the 3d or 2d to add more stars after that we can use select move button to adjust the positions and you can see the change in 2d window as well let's open render window and then choose interactive render so select the custom button and then now we are going to zoom in to see the results clearly change the material type to glass and this is one of the material we can only see in render and we can also change the color to maybe yellow as well you can change another color that you like so that is this is the tutorial to teach you how to make the third pom pom the first tree and the custom beads for the christmas head thanks for watching bye you ",
        "Summary": "# Comprehensive Guide to Creating a Christmas Hat with Pom-Poms and Custom Beads This guide provides step-by-step instructions based on the provided transcript. It covers the entire process of creating a Christmas hat with pom-poms and custom beads, including definitions, tips, and tricks. ## Step 1: Setting Up Your Workspace 1. **Download Factory Folder**: Ensure you have downloaded the factory folder which contains the necessary files. 2. **Open the Folder**: Inside the factory folder, you will find two subfolders named \"A\" and \"B\". Double-click to open folder A. 3. **Access Complete and Practice Files**: Within folder A, you will see files labeled \"Complete\" and \"Practice\". Open the \"Complete\" file to check the final results. ## Step 2: Drawing the Circle 1. **Open 2D Pattern Window**: Hold down the polygon button and choose \"Ellipse\" or press the shortcut key 'E'. 2. **Create Ellipse**: - Left-click to open the Create Ellipse window. - Set both the width and height to **10 mm**. - Click **OK**. ## Step 3: Assigning Fabric to the Circle 1. **Transform Pattern**: Zoom in on the circle. 2. **Assign New Fabric**: - Right-click and choose **Assign to New Topic**. - Use the Transform Pattern tool to select the circle. 3. **Adjust Properties**: - In the Property Editor, set **Pattern Distance** to **0.8 mm**. - Change **Additional Thickness Rendering** to **100**. ## Step 4: Exporting the Circle as an OBJ File 1. **Check in 3D Window**: Confirm the circle appears thicker due to the increased thickness rendering. 2. **Export**: - Click **File** > **Export** > **OBJ Selected**. - Choose the correct export options: select **Single Object**, bake the texture, and set the scale to **millimeter**. - Click **OK** to confirm. ## Step 5: Importing the OBJ File 1. **Delete the Pattern**: Select and delete the pattern. 2. **Import OBJ**: - Click **File** > **Import** > **Add OBJ**. - Find the exported OBJ in the folder. - Set **Load Type** to **Add**, **Object Type** to **Trim**, and **Scale** to **40**. - Click **OK** to confirm. ## Step 6: Attaching the OBJ to the Hat 1. **Glue the OBJ**: - Click the blue icon and left-click to place it at the tip of the hat. - Use the yellow square to adjust the position and rotate if necessary. 2. **Check Weight**: - Select the OBJ and go to the Property Editor. - If the weight is too heavy (e.g., **72 grams**), change it to **2 grams**. ## Step 7: Simulating and Rendering 1. **Turn on Simulation**: Interact with the pattern to see how it reacts. Adjust as necessary. 2. **Render Preview**: - Click **Render** and select the first option. - Click the image and check medial properties to ensure image size and resolution are appropriate. - Click **Interactive Render**. ## Step 8: Changing Material to Fur 1. **Select Material**: Change the pom-pom material to **Fur**. 2. **Adjust Fur Properties**: - Length: Change from **50 mm** to **10 mm**. - Thickness: Set to **0.8 mm**. - Grossness: Set to **0**. - Softness: Set to **0** for a synthetic feel. 3. **Final Adjustments**: Continue adjusting values until desired results are achieved. ## Step 9: Creating Custom Beads 1. **Create New Fabric**: - Click **Add** to create a new fabric named \"Fabric 1\". - Choose **Rectangle 2** and set dimensions to **13 mm width** and **30 mm height**. - Click **OK**. 2. **Split Outline**: - Right-click on the outline and choose **Split** > **Uniform Split** with **2 segments** for both outlines. 3. **Draw Base Lines**: Use Base Polygon to draw three base lines connecting the corners and adjust the points downward by specified distances (9 mm, 8 mm, 9 mm). ## Step 10: Exporting the Star Shape 1. **Unfold and Adjust**: - Right-click, unfold the outline, then delete middle points. - Lower curvature value to **10** and set **Pattern Distance** to **0.8 mm**. - Increase **Thickness Rendering** to **1.5 mm**. 2. **Export Star Shape**: - Select the star shape, click **File** > **Export** > **OBJ Selected**. - Confirm export options and save. ## Step 11: Creating a Thumbnail for the Star 1. **Create Thumbnail**: - Select the star, right-click and choose **Format 3D Background** to solid fill with a gray background. - Use an image capture tool to take a snapshot of the 3D window and save it as JPEG. ## Step 12: Importing the Star to the 3D Window 1. **Import the Star OBJ**: - Click **File** > **Import** > **Add OBJ**. - Use the default options for import. 2. **Position the Star**: Adjust its placement using the visible tool and ensure it touches the 3D grid. ## Step 13: Final Adjustments 1. **Export Adjustments**: Once satisfied with the placement, export again to replace the original OBJ. 2. **Register Custom Button**: Go to the button page in the object browser, click the cross icon to rename it and add the star OBJ with the thumbnail. 3. **Delete Original**: After registration, delete the original object to clean up. ## Step 14: Rendering the Final Product 1. **Final Render**: - Zoom into the Christmas hat and open the render window. - Adjust materials (e.g., glass for beads) and colors as desired. - Use **Interactive Render** to see the final results. ## Tips and Tricks - **Use Shortcuts**: Familiarize yourself with shortcuts like 'E' for ellipse, and 'F' to focus on selected patterns. - **Frequent Saves**: Save your work regularly to avoid losing progress. - **Experiment with Materials**: Don’t hesitate to try different materials and colors; rendering allows you to see changes in real-time. - **Adjust Parameters Gradually**: Make small adjustments to properties for better control over the final appearance. - **Zoom and Rotate**: Use zoom and rotation features frequently to ensure all parts are positioned correctly. By following this guide, you should successfully create your Christmas hat with pom-poms and custom beads in a 3D design software. Enjoy your creative process!"

        "Transcript": "hello welcome to crow hong kong the fourth online public workshop this workshop will demonstrate how to make the advanced streams in cloud so this workshop we will divide it into two parts the first part will demonstrate how to create a border patch as well as custom sequence and then after 10 minutes break we'll go over to all the part 2 which our poly will demonstrate how to create pom pom and virgins as well as the starbucks with logos so here we start first please go to open your closed software and you will see the cloud interface um we have already shared the part one material to you so please download it into your desktop and uh at the file path at your library include so you should able to just like as now what i'm showcased to you here you're already add the file path part one material enzyme library so when you double click you should able to see there are also two subfolders one named uh first part a and body and then the other one is b sequence so please open embody patch and please now uh please double click christmas scarf c c project files please double click it so already you've got the pre-made scuffed on inside clothes so this exercise will demonstrate how to add the embroidery patches of this ginger batman's um onto the scarf so in real life of course we will already got the embroidered patch um so you could able to sew it onto the scarf but how about you close so uh same you're using your physical uh patch and boring patch you scan it or take full use of it and then create a digital image of this embroidery patch so in the exercise in this folder we already providing you a gingerbread man's uh image file which is named texture underscore gingerbatman.png so um you may notice the format is not in jpeg but rather in png it's because uh this image is to make sure the background is in transparent so that it can uh when you add into cloud you will know no you will not see the white or black background but rather you can see the total outlines of these shapes of the border patch but so uh you may also you can foresee that after you scanned it or take photos of the patch you may need to edit these graphics in photoshop before hand so uh i just quickly showcased to you in photoshop right now uh i already added the uh already pre uh pre-treat this uh image and to make sure that these backgrounds is in transparent so you can see those backgrounds is in the greeted form and just only showcasing the outlines of these gingerbread then you can now you can save files as the png make sure it's in png so of course now because i already saved the texture image beforehand so i don't i won't i won't go further please but besides that uh go back to the close uh folders you may also notice there are and there is another image file called displacement underscore ginger batman this time is jpeg file this is a additional or map of recorded displacement map is to create the those graphics specifically area that is uh have the pumpiness effects which makes it 3d looks like in 3d window so um those are displacement map they are first you may notice this is uh black and white graphics monochrome colors uh for the right area and black area is indicating something specifically in 3d so again let's go let me go back to the photoshops and using these um backgrounds using the same image this gingerbread texture image whatever you can uh using select tools uh to select those specific areas that you want to create the plumpiness uh for this uh time i will use let's say magic wall or or maybe select by color range or this different color selections to create those are to select those areas that you want to exclude it out as the company uh area so um this times i already um create selected those areas which including the outlines the uh gingerbread man out uh shapes that with stitching the overlord stitching and then those are stitching uh whatever on this uh junior batman's eyes my uh valve and all those details i will make it into a white um white color and then um i just mixed it extra maybe acting the clipping mask or the extra layers of backgrounds into black color so in this time now i retreated this improv image with these monochrome colors so the white area as i mentioned those white areas will indicating the pumping areas the popping up areas and then the black one goes black areas will be appearing flat which is no pumpiness at all okay so before we export as to jpegs for displacement map we need to add an extra some uh extra effects which need to add the filter but first i'll let me merge the merge layers into a single layer file and then turn it into the or maybe smart objects or flatten image so and now i can i need to apply the blur filter um i would we would suggest you recommend you to use gaussian blur these uh filter because in order to uh to make the blur to make the outline edge smoother and appears in 3d window to create this very smooth outlines wherever you're using two or five or three so um let's now let's do it with three say okay then now you've got the displacement map but of course you need now need to save as um jpegs files because uh same i already provided you the displacement lab so i won't do it i won't say really save here um now uh we if we want to uh we got the image and we got a displacement map so now we can officially start to create a patch for the gingerbreads man but first we need to make the patterns for this for those patches same in chloe we need to using the patterns representing extra layers of the physical form of the patch so um same i already given to you the patents for the ginger batman which is in cp zpac um just simply add into workspace right click then you now got whatever you showcase in 3d and 2d window you got these uh gingerbread patterns uh but of course uh if you do if you want to if you have any other custom shapes of the patch patterns use are same you can use to like those pattern tools such as a polygon or square different shapes to create a pattern first and then using uh the internal line to trace out the outlines of the patterns of your embroidery patch and then cut it so uh this is just for time wise i prepare for you in advance so make sure that the outline is cleaned it and with all those clothes that are our lives so uh now let's focus on these patch this pack pattern for patch and now we can apply the texture image on it um at the same time you can go to wherever in library uh select the image of the texture image please make sure it's the texture image and then right click add as graphic so um i recommend you to move to 2d windows and then just click appoint the ginger batman's patterns so for size we won't make any adjustment at this stage we just simply click ok um even though you see in 2d window the image is looks much bigger than the patterns itself but no worries we can adjust later on that and then we now need to focus instantly on to the property editor so you go down to the right hand right bottom hand corner you see the property editor but once we add the graphics as a texture image on the pattern you will see instantly the basic under basic parameters texture already given to the gingerbed image so now we can adjust uh accordingly about the normal map uh we can utilize we click the arrows the triangle next to it and then adjust its intensity adjust its intensity to let's say 50 and then we go into displacement map so because we already prepared a displacement for you so you can simply go to the library using our drag and drop functions to apply the displacement map drag and drop or you can also utilize the open path to open the file path where you got the displacement and then click to open same they both the same okay so once we act at the displacement map we can adjust its parameter accordingly as the below list for the amount uh according to the handouts i already yes uh which is amount is one um and then shift is zero clipping is zero total distance um you may adjust to or two or even less and make sure to keep continuously so let's do it now in here and for a color we don't need to change because the image already uh provided to you so now we can utilize the uh click the graphics in 2d window using your mouse uh left click your graphics and you will see these compacts of adjusting to transform the graphic you can press the shift key try to scale down the the texture image size in order to align the pattern outlines seams need to be like slightly smaller until you don't see any gas between or even smaller times more see until you don't see any white gaps in between the graphics and the pattern outlines so now you can able to um see these patches is now adding with graphics but now on even though we got the uh patch with the front image applied but when you turn in 3d window 10 to the back side of these patterns you will see it still appear in white even if you show uh if your infinity window showcasing the fake texture survey display which represent the thickness of the fabric of the patterns it was still able to see that at the thickness edge it's still in white color because for this pattern once we are we are we're acting the pattern we haven't assigned any fabrics uh of course the uh the assigned fabric type would be just the default one um but now uh since we got the image and the displacement normal that applied it now we can adjust the pattern itself with the correct fabrics so now let's go to object browser um now because i click in the pattern wherever you click in 3d or 2d window uh the um indicating using uh fabric type is will be highlighted in blue so you see now the fabric one which is uh currently applying onto these uh touch patterns so you click in the fabric one now we need to adjust the fabric properties whatever is texture so we now uh we can first we need to rename it so we can distinguish these fabric type so i type it and pull the touch and border patch and then go down to the property editor going down to uh fabric type now we still are utilizing fabric matte and to texture now since i also given to you uh the jpeg file of the touch image of felt woo felt woo you may simply select the fab rule drag and drop into texture column on the row of course you also can utilize the open icon open file path icon to select the file or image to open it for texture so same go down to normal map we can you can uh auto generate by adjusting its intensity now let's say uh 50. uh in the handout i also given to you so please just follow the handout settings so let's uh jump directly into because this is just fabric we don't add in displacement map and go down to color now because this um currently the pie texture image is still very not matching the embroidery patch front color so uh either you can uh let's make it the saturation off so to make it like the fab white color desaturate it and then now let's go to color click the color chips and then use the eye droplet to copy these color these color of the front patches the brown color copy this and then you can you may add in uh placing at so that you can save this color palette this uh copy the color palette into this uh into the product library and then click ok so you may see now the um the backsides whatever the texture or even the color is matching to the front it's matching to the front and now let's go down to the physical properties let's jump into the physical properties under presets please click the drop down menu you will see all those presets physical properties of the fabric types and please select it so now if this patches has the properties of the rule um physical properties so in 3d now it looks more reasonable as a patch itself so uh let's go like this and now since it just is the settings for these patches we haven't attached it onto the scarf so this time just in 2d i just slightly change the position of the placement of these two patches patterns and now we need to uh solder it onto the scalp um how so before we sew it we need to create internal shapes onto this gap so it's like the sewing path when you apply the sewing tool please now click still selecting in 2d window i will just focus on 2d window first and then right click upon these selected please click to select the patterns the patch pattern first and then right click upon it now please select clone as internal shape clone as internal shape so when you click it you will see the uh yellow outlines transparent kind of light is maneuvering of uh while your mouse maneuvering of rolling your mouse with the arrow dot line so you can freely decide which position of this internal shapes place it on this graph i will just show selecting the uh right bottom corner right bottom corner so i'll just change i just let me quickly change to monochrome surface so you can able to see these internal shapes i already applied on this stuff okay but of course you can still um no not follow me to change it okay now we already got the internal shapes on the scarf now uh this indicating sewing path which between the patches and the scarf okay so please now go to free sewing we use free sew and two simple free sewing tool please remember always start with the shorter length first so in this case i will sew i will turning roll around to sew the um patches outline first and then remember uh you need to start with the according to correspondent positions um on the internal shape stats on this discount so say turning around i show it like a clock rise so please double click and not couple click but just simply click it then in 3d window you should able to see the sewing license instantly formed it okay and now let's uh go to focus on 3d window please change the select and move to instead of sewing to please click to select and move to so that you can now select the gingerbread mat at the gingerbread patterns in 3d window like what i'm doing right now i select it and select the pattern in 3d window so you see the gizmo but instead using gizmo to move uh to the areas that on the scaf rather we were using the function please appoint the selection right click the drop down uh menu you will have superimposed from um over super impose over please click it so just one simple click you can automatically place these patches onto the soldered area of the scarf okay regardless sticking onto the scarf so we can zoom it to c right now and now we can go to uh finally how to see the pumpiness effects that we set through the displacement map now please go to render window which is at the top bar menu you see the uh the light column called render please click render underneath render and then you instantly got your render window opened um before we really interact uh uh interactive render engine please make sure go to uh the render properties and then under property editor which somehow showcasing the render engine properties information please make sure if you're using the graphic cast that is navita which is close recommended please use gpu cuda gpu kudos as your render ng if you are not using the reader but rather but other graphic cards such as macbooks to store graphic cards then please change to cpu for render ng um so this is just one kind of reminder for you guys and then um we can go back to the um to click the interactive render now please click interactive render give them some times so the render window will now start to calculating and rendering slightly slowly so now you will see under render window those are when the time you create the displacement map those white area indicating the pumpiness now i'm showcasing the the 3d look but of course you can always click the image back while using uh active a transform graphic to click using transform graphic 2 in 3d window click the graphics and then you can always adjust is its amount of the pumpiness to make it more pumpy or even lower the particle distance to make it more fined details resolutions remember to stop render before you press final render for exporting the render image or videos so um this is how we can create for the patch the scarf so now we will go to the second part part b which is how to create sequence so um now you can go to files and save your current project file for the staff with embroidery patch of course you can save as your desktop or whatever the location that you want to save um and then now we need to move on please click the library out and double assess double click to access the part one material folder and now uh previously we uh we take the embroidery patch folder but now we need to click speed sequence double click you will able to see there's four files inside so let's talk about talking about sequence we will introduce two methods to create sequence the very first i would like to introduce now demonstrating now is to create sequence by top stitch functions so but beforehand we need to prepare a sequence image file which we need to do it in photoshop although of course in the folder you will able to see these sequence png files which are providing to you already you can directly use it but just let me quickly introduce how to make the sequence in photoshop so in photoshop right now i already created the project create a file with uh draw i already draw through the circles uh in grayish color and then create a little hole to indicating the shapes of the sequence and now uh we will utilize the brush 2 inside photoshop and to add some shininess like a reflective uh but reflective theme like uh when seeing your sequence single sequence chips so i recommend you to using some uh to use uh some quite um strokes brush uh brush strokes with a very quite large size uh of course no hardness and i especially recommend you to adjust the opacity to 20 or even lower so you just simply as the handle indicate here that i use the brush tool to draw a diagonal lines across the center of this sequence to make it like more reflective shininess look likes so same i using push to adjust the value already and just simply draw a diagonal line if you think oh it's not obvious enough you can always add the multiple strokes to make it more obvious so now of course i already imagine uh eliminating the backgrounds so this should be transparent of the background and now you can go under photoshop you can say export it as a png you can quickly export or export as png and of course because i given already given to you the project sorry the uh sequence image so i no longer save it here just once you save it you can always go back to the product file sorry go back to clone and now please go to uh inside the folder b sequence folder we now open uh our browser back c project files velvet backed c project files double click i just clicked no but yeah because it was overwriting it because you already saved in advance right so you just simply click open click ok and now we got the uh port uh driver porch here with the 2d window indicating the patterns so uh now we we got the sequence for our image and now we can go utilizing top stitch as i as i mentioned we can utilize the top stitch too so please go to object browser go under the top stitch tab now currently there are no stop sheets dot stitch added with just a single default top stitch appear here please click it under the object browser and indicate uh on the property editor there's more information about the specification and details about top stage of this top stage please go to uh under type type beam change to texture texture so according to the handouts so we now change uh type to texture and then offset we can we adjust to zeros and stitch count which just remaining one for the shapes we just simply according to the handouts we just simply as stated as custom as it is and spi which is speech stitch per inch we go to six temporary according to the um handouts and keep remaining 40 for the flat thickness and when you're move on moving on uh for the material type now according to the hanno because sequence is material type uh metallic material type would be metal right metal light for the surface so please now change to metal for the material type material type change to metal and under basic parameters for textures pleat as this is default ones but now we need to we'll change it to sequence same wise we can you can go to under library using drag and drop using a monster and drop the sequence image file png into the texture directly like this or you can utilize the icons for open file path to locate the sequence image file from windows sync wise so uh of course you can uh folder this uh for you can adjust the intensity for the normal map or now as according to hana we didn't change any but going down to displacement map same uh we can utilize the sequence uh in image file and use it directly for the displacement map so um as i mentioned this placemap is kind of like a monochrome image which using for the light for the lighter color parts which is bright grayish color it will indicating the pumpiness of the image so as this case you can slightly using this image because it's monochrome to access displacement map and you can adjust lightly which is just slightly the pumpiness amount i would suggest according to the hangout would be 0.1 0.1 and it's particle distance to one because it's so small the size of this sequence is just uh less than five millimeters sorry five cm five cms or one cm so we would work best to remain the particle distance as smallest as we can so of course keep continuously continuity on and i don't adjust color here because i want to create the the metalness uh colors as from it's like a silverish so but of course you're welcome to add color here but you all will see it later on when you add top stitch so now we kind of like uh customize the yeah okay so just uh make sure the specifications uh is making um alignment with the hammocks so now we can go back to the 2d window we can now adding the top stitch onto the porches but beforehand since we for the top stage we need to act internalize in advance so please now utilizing the internal polygon line too you can simply just draw a in this uh demo i would draw a diagonal lines some random corner and now i use active pattern two to select these internal lines right click offset as internal line offset as internal light i will add kind of like a 15 millimeters distance so for the front parts i will add around 11   internal lines and things for these extra in turn offset internal lines i will extend and trim to pattern outlines so that it will automatically extend those added internal lines until the pattern aligned under this porch front i'm sorry it's bad we should be back yeah just let me shift my real point towards the this sides so yeah it's now corresponding so this is the correct size that i add the internal lines okay so i may also add the extra ones for the reverse directions this time i just only add one same i'm trim off those extended internal lines out so now i got all the necessary internal lines ready for adding the top stitch so uh for adding top stitch i thought you guys are familiar with which tools you're using because i have just the same simple um single uh lines so i will use segment top stitch and make sure you are of course uh let me rename it is sequence so let me still just for me to distinguish this is not a normal top stitch this is a sequence top stitch and i start to by clicking my left mouse button one time i or i can automatically add the top stitch so because you cannot see right now because i think uh due to the size of the image settings for the top stitch image sorry the sequence image so i may fine tune adjust i may need to fine-tune for adjustments maybe 100 even more maybe 200. yeah i need to even more or even 600 yeah it makes more sense right now okay 800. so uh i think whatever is because it's uh this size is varied by whatever you're using tests or millimeters for millimeters this is four millimeters per unit so just indicating the size of these sequence single sequence so the thickness is four millimeters four millimeters for the thickness so uh this will be depending on which unit you're using for four or forty it vary so in this case i use four millimeters for fat thickness now it seems more reasonable right now for the sequence size as a top stitch so uh if you would like to check the pumpiness is is this realistic enough you always can go to now uh on the top bar menu render render open the render window again please press interactive render and now you should be able to see under the render window how these uh sequence will be look like let me let me zoom it out a little bit so since i add the displacement map for the sequence it will look now a little bit more pumpiness for uh as it will act like a sequence um sticking a stitching onto the surface of this patch for porch leather porch so this is how one of the methods that we use to apply use to apply the sequence especially it would be much uh useful if you want to create certain patterns by sequence just like in this case you want to create a diagonal strike patterns by sequence so now let's turn into another side let me stop the render engine right now and close out the render window we will focus on to the other parts of the patterns which is the back sides back sides besides we will demonstrate another method to create sequence by according to the handouts of object creations so which means we create a single sequence file by object by an obj so let's go back to cloud but first we need instead of create an image for the sequence now we use a patterns for sequence of course the sequence you can design two different shapes but in this for demonstration we will use the circle so uh to create circle patterns of course we utilize the pattern two ellipse two ellipse two ellipse two so um according to handouts we will keep using ellipse two to create uh the size 10 millimeters times 10 millimeters for the sequence we just simply insert diameters under the windows so then we utilize the internal ellipse to internal ellipse 2 to create a hole on the top edge of these uh sequence patterns i think the size as the handle indicates is two millimeters times two millimeters so please type in and then use the transform pattern to select these internal ellipse shapes right click convert to hole convert to hole then you should others would be to hold inside these sequence patterns so but uh in 3d window let's locate it these um patterns um as you see right now the um the patterns is quite rough uh it's not as really like a point of shapes it's because the particle distance this pattern's particle distance is still very large which is 20. so please change this particle distance to 0.8 first to make it more finer edge like more high resolutions and then lower its curvature to 7 t instead of 100 okay so when you're rotating the angle wheeling angle and 3d window you will see it makes more sense for our sequence shapes and i will add extra more turning rolling down to additional thickness rendering um i will add a little tiny more thickness which is 0.2 as the handle indicate to make it a slightly thicker than the previous uh the default settings so now uh when we're talking about the uh pattern itself is fine the shape is fine but the fabric qualities now it's currently using the fabric one you see the blue fonts highlighted so i rather instead of using fabric one i will right click assign to new fabric upon the selected sequence pattern and i will name this new fabric type for sequence specifically and now on i create the shapes of this sequence so um i will now move it on to in under 2d windows since the location right now i will uh i will place it i will place it move it onto the x and y into setting points i will move these patterns sorry and then um infinity window as well right click reset to the arrangement selected so uh for the upper wheel you will see um these 3d uh infinity window this sequence away from the center so i will use the gizmo 2 to change the viewing angle make sure you are using the number key i would suggest using 5 for the top wheel and the number 4 or number 6 to get the correct accurate side wheel you can zoom in and then i will lay in flat using the gizmo blue circles to lay in fact so that uh for apollo again you will see this pattern sorry these are sequence patterns is placing on above the x and y uh grids the x x and y axis the center of x and y assets same in 2d and 3d window okay so uh this is in purpose for preparing to export these um this pattern as the object files obj files so now let's move to files white left hand corner export please go to export obj obj click obj then please name it first i think uh you can name it as sequence and now you see the pop-up window called expo obj according to the handouts i've already indicated this settings recommended for exporting these obj so please make sure to select all patterns click all patterns single object fit text effect uh and then on the basic scale you choose a millimeters and then please make sure to save the with absolute texture image okay so select all buttons single objects fixed and millimeters and same with absolute texture image file path click ok then you should able to locate the obj that create a for sequence which names uh sequence buttons obj so you don't need to save edge all but of course if you like you can um just like what i did here you can just do the step that i demonstrate then now we will move on to uh after deforming these obj we can register these um these this sequence as the buttons and sides so please click go to 3d window and click button tools of course or you can also click the button tab under object browser and click the default buttons click the default buttons so uh go down to the property editor you should able to see the shapes under the shapes row of course the default ones is listed here but but now since we have already saved the custom-made sequence buttons as buttons so now please click these app buttons these add buttons this means register the buttons okay so you can name it this time we call it sequence as well um and then please click these open file path icon to locating back the sequence that you saved um of course now please use back these uh sequence buttons for 3d object files under the part 1 materials b sequence folder open and then of course you can also add the thumbnail image uh also providing to you through the part one uh cb sequence files just crop image uh from the from the 3d window so you now can register these um buttons these buttons as the sequence the single sequence but of course you can adjust its size uh but now on is just uh width uh for dimensional weight is 10.5 millimeters 1cm of thickness is one uh 0.9 mm weight is 0.1 of course you can adjust here by uh the dimension and also the thickness but as hints here i will no longer adjust anymore just for demonstrations i will just simply use the current settings for the size and for the button settings of course the material type this since it is sequence so i will of course i will change the material type to metal and of course you can add any texture if you have any customized texture um since it's obj i think the texture things is no longer needed okay um now let's use the co because now we're using button two so now you can simply just directly add 2d window you can simply randomly by using your left mouse button to click and add the sequence of course now if you see in 3d window this is the custom balance that you register as a sequence it looks a little bit that seems as i mentioned you can always click this this button type under the button tab and then adjust its size under property editor let's say now i change to five millimeters looks uh half smaller and one more things uh you may see that when you close up there's uh still a scap in between the fab uh the porch surface the porch back surface and the sequence is because of the settings of the collision so in order to make sure the uh distance is narrower between the uh the porch fabric surface to uh and the sequence you can take the collision off and then use the gizmo to this time i use the side wheel so i will use the red arrow to try to stick it a little tighter to the surface of this pack porch bags same wise for the the other sequence that i just add i only add two so click a collision off so that it won't uh it will no longer have the distance reserved it so of course in the handouts i already indicating uh the specific like this kind of results you can register as many as you can using these obj method to create a pattern for a single sequence whatever the circle around shape or other custom shapes like star like other heart shapes you can use it the pattern you can create a pattern for the sequence and register as the obj format file and then use it as the buttons register as the buttons insides of course you can also copy and then adjust the bigger size big i think it's big and then let's say i change into num uh x millimeters width with thickness 1 mm so i register and other buttons but in a different color let's change here another color like the golden yellow one maybe so i can always create different types of sequence as a single sequence chips of course same you need to if you want to make it more realistic you need to click turn off these sequence buttons collision and then adjust is yeah adjusts its distance in between the fabrics surface this is how we can um create the custom sequence the advantage of this sequence method is you can add the multiple different types of custom single sequence and place it the red in the random way not as the same as this uh top stitch weight the top stitch way is more for the patternized uh arrangement for the sequence but instead of these uh you can either mix uh two ways to create the ideal designs you ",
        "Summary": "# Comprehensive Guide to Creating Advanced Embroidery and Sequence Designs in CLO 3D This guide outlines the steps taken during the CLO 3D workshop focused on creating advanced embroidery designs and sequences. The workshop is divided into two parts: the first part covers creating embroidered patches and custom sequences, while the second part demonstrates creating sequins and logos. ## Part 1: Creating an Embroidered Patch ### Step 1: Setting Up the Workspace 1. **Open CLO 3D Software**: Start by launching the CLO 3D software. 2. **Download Materials**: Ensure you have downloaded the provided materials for Part 1 onto your desktop. 3. **Locate the File Path**: Access the library and navigate to the Part 1 materials folder. You should find two subfolders: - A) Embody Patch - B) Sequence ### Step 2: Preparing the Patch Design 1. **Open the Embroidery Patch**: - Double-click the `Christmas Scarf CC` project file to open it. 2. **Add the Gingerbread Patch**: - Find the `texture_gingerbatman.png` file in the Embody Patch folder. - This PNG format ensures a transparent background for easy overlay. 3. **Edit the Image in Photoshop**: - Open the image in Photoshop to ensure the background is transparent. - Use selection tools to isolate the gingerbread man and save it as a PNG. 4. **Create a Displacement Map**: - Use the `displacement_gingerbatman.jpeg` file as a monochrome map indicating 3D effects. - Edit this image to define the areas you want to appear \"puffy\" using white (for raised areas) and black (for flat areas). - Save the edited displacement map as a JPEG. ### Step 3: Designing the Patch 1. **Create the Patch Pattern**: - Import the gingerbread pattern from `cp_zpac` into your workspace. - Adjust the outlines and ensure they are clean. 2. **Apply Texture**: - Right-click the pattern and select \"Add as Graphic.\" - In the Property Editor, adjust the graphics settings. 3. **Setup Normal and Displacement Maps**: - Set the normal map intensity to 50. - Add the displacement map you created earlier and adjust settings according to provided handouts. ### Step 4: Attaching the Patch to the Scarf 1. **Position the Patch**: - Align the patch with the scarf in the 2D window. 2. **Create Internal Shapes for Sewing**: - Right-click the patch and select “Clone as Internal Shape.” 3. **Sew the Patch to the Scarf**: - Use the Free Sewing tool to sew around the patch. - Adjust the sewing path as required. ### Step 5: Rendering the Design 1. **Render the Final Design**: - Open the render window and select the appropriate rendering engine (GPU or CPU). - Click on Interactive Render to see the final look of your patch. ## Part 2: Creating Sequences ### Step 1: Preparing the Sequence Image 1. **Open the Sequence Folder**: Access the B Sequence folder in your material library. 2. **Create Sequence Image**: - Use Photoshop to create a PNG of a sequin design, ensuring to eliminate the background for transparency. - Export the finished image as a PNG. ### Step 2: Adding the Sequence 1. **Create the Top Stitch**: - In the Object Browser, under the Top Stitch tab, set the type to texture and import your sequin image. - Adjust the stitch count and thickness according to your design. 2. **Applying the Sequence**: - Draw internal lines on the desired area of the fabric and offset them to create space for the top stitch. - Use the Segment Top Stitch tool to apply the sequins. ### Step 3: Creating Custom Sequence Buttons 1. **Create Circle Patterns**: - Use the Ellipse tool to create round shapes. Adjust dimensions as needed. 2. **Export as OBJ**: - Export the custom sequence design as an OBJ file, ensuring to select the appropriate settings (absolute texture paths, etc.). 3. **Register Sequences as Buttons**: - In the Object Browser, click on the button tool and register your OBJ as a new button. - Adjust sizes and collision settings to tightly fit onto your fabric. ### Step 4: Final Adjustments 1. **Play with Sizes and Colors**: - Adjust the sizes and colors of the registered buttons to achieve the desired look. 2. **Final Render**: - Render your final design to showcase the sequins on your project. ## Tips and Tricks - **Use PNG for Transparency**: Always prefer PNG files for images needing transparent backgrounds. - **Organize Your Files**: Keep your workspace tidy by organizing files into clearly labeled folders. - **Save Frequently**: Regularly save your work to avoid losing progress. - **Experiment with Settings**: Don’t hesitate to adjust parameters to see how they affect the final render. - **Utilize Handouts**: Always refer to handouts for specific values and settings to ensure accuracy. By following these steps and using the tips outlined, you can successfully create advanced embroidery patches and sequins within CLO 3D, enhancing your design portfolio."

        "publishedAt": "2021-04-20T18:23:50Z",
        "Transcript": "in this video we are going to go through the advanced concepts of the multi-texture editor the first advanced concept i would like to go over is the effects the property editor has on the multi-texture editor the most important thing to know is anything you do in the property editor is going to override what's being done in the multi-texture editor desaturation is a perfect example of this if you desaturate a texture anything that's done in the multi-texture editor is going to be override so once i open up my multi-texture editor a pop-up comes up saying textures are going to be shown as saturated while in the texture editor if i hit ok you'll see exactly what happens all of these images are going to show up saturated instead of desaturated and here you see that exactly so now my sweatshirt looks a lot more saturated and color if i added a print which i will do here by going to my add button and here i'm going to add in this splatter now you see this print on top of the saturated fabric and i'm going to hit apply now it still looks saturated but once i hit apply and close that desaturation is going to over rule so now my sweatshirt looks desaturated that's because desaturation is still checked on in my property editor so everything is going to be desaturated in the texture that doesn't mean what i've done in the multi-texture editor didn't happen if i zoom in here you see that that splatter is still on the sweatshirt it's just all been desaturated if i decide to uncheck desaturation over here in my property editor it'll look exactly as it did when it was in the multi-texture editor now there's this dark gray color because there's a cover color overlay on top of this if i just turn off this color now it will look exactly what the original texture was the second advanced concept i would like to go over is with blending so here i'm going to go back to my multi-texture editor and select my texture now here under paint you see blend now here in blend i have this drop down menu with a lot of different options on how i could blend here is an image of all of the different options of my blending mode the link to this image is provided below the third advanced concept i wanted to go through was the ability to change your canvas size here i would like uh to change my canvas size to a larger size that is because my canvas size is very small when increasing your canvas size please know that it may slow down your work speed since i'm changing it to the default camera size it will be fine so i'm going to change it to 1024x1024 if i'd like to change this in inches i could have just used my drop down menu and then changed in inches as you can see here i'm going to stick with pixels i'm also going to change my pixels per inch to 96. as you can see my texture now has some transparency part of it that's because my texture is no longer filling the entire canvas size if i turn off my opacity it will be white instead of transparent to have my texture fill the entire canvas size i have a few options i could use this wheel here to resize my texture so that it fills the canvas or i could use this transformation option down here to resize my texture but i like the size of the texture so what i'm going to do is check off tile this will then tile out my texture to fill the entire canvas without changing the size of my texture finally i would like to go over how you can create a print from scratch within club i'm first going to go to my add button and bring in a shape that i have created you can create a shape in any different software program and save it out as a png i'm going to bring in a stripe once i've brought in the shape that i'd like to use i would suggest making any edits that you would like to see throughout the entire print in your first layer so here if i'd like to make any blend changes any opacities or any color changes that i would like to see throughout every single layer make sure you do it in your first layer so i'm going to actually make sure that this layer has an overlay and that i change this color to a blue i don't want to change anything with the opacity i'm happy with that so now i'm just going to resize my stripe and change the angle around and just place it now i'm just going to copy this layer and everything i did to that original layer will be done to this copy i'm going to lock this layer and then rename it i like to name my first layer exactly where it is in my canvas size it's helpful to me i'm now going to select my second layer and move it as you can see it's exactly the same as the first i can change the color around if i would like but then that color will be copied over once i hit copy it's important to note that the layer that will be moved is the layer that's selected not the layer that you click on in your canvas window so i'm going to lock that bottom layer and now select and move the top layer i can again change this color if i wanted to and when i copy this over the color that i changed it to will be in the copy i'm going to lock this bottom layer and as you can see i cannot edit or move around any changes also if you copy over a locked layer that will copy over as locked as well here i can resize this but if it was locked i could not resize it i could be resizing and making all my edits using my transformation but i'm very comfortable with the wheel so i'm going to continue to make changes using this wheel i can now again copy this layer and move it and change the position here i can make sure that i'm moving the correct layer by using these eyes next to each layer i can hide and show each layer using them so that i know i'm selecting the correct layer that i want to move or copy here i'm just i can rearrange my layers by just dragging and moving them up as you just saw and i can continue to do this throughout now that i have all my layers selected i've now decided that i want to extend them all to the other side so that they're all longer because i decided this once i was done i now have to select every single layer and check off extend to other side if i knew i wanted to do this in the beginning and i checked it off with my first layer that would have then copied over to all the other layers saving me some time which is why it's always helpful to know what you're going to do in the beginning so that you can set it all up and then copy that same thing all over once i'm all set with my print and i like it i can then hit apply if i would like to change the size of this print i would want to use the texture editor tool in my 3d window here so that i could resize the print that's because i do not want to resize it using canvas size that will slow everything down but using the texture editor tool it will make everything easier you can also see that this file has been saved if i go to file open i will see my print saved out as a flat image it's also saved in a temporary folder so it's important to always select this file and bring it into a folder that you have easy access to by just copying and pasting it also since this is a flat image if i'd ever like to see this as my layered print i have to open up this original clo file thank you for watching this video i hope you enjoyed it you ",
        "Summary": "# Comprehensive Guide to the Multi-Texture Editor ## Introduction This guide covers advanced concepts of the Multi-Texture Editor used for editing textures in a design software.

Understanding the Property Editor - Desaturation Effect - Step-by-Step Instructions - Tips and Tricks 2. Blending Modes - Overview of Blending - Step-by-Step Instructions - Tips and Tricks 3. Changing Canvas Size - Importance of Canvas Size - Step-by-Step Instructions - Tips and Tricks 4. Creating a Print from Scratch - Adding Shapes - Editing Layers - Finalizing the Print - Tips and Tricks 5. Saving and Accessing Your Work --- ## 1. Understanding the Property Editor ### Desaturation Effect The Property Editor allows for global adjustments to textures, such as desaturation, which overrides settings in the Multi-Texture Editor. ### Step-by-Step Instructions 1. **Open Multi-Texture Editor**: When you open the Multi-Texture Editor, a pop-up will appear indicating that textures will be shown as saturated. 2. **Hit 'OK'**: Click 'OK' to proceed. 3. **Observe Saturation**: Notice that all textures appear more saturated, including any prints you add. 4. **Add a Print**: Click the 'Add' button and select a texture (e.g., a splatter). 5. **Apply Changes**: Hit 'Apply' to see the changes. The texture will remain saturated due to the desaturation option being checked in the Property Editor. 6. **Uncheck Desaturation**: To see the original texture colors, uncheck the desaturation option in the Property Editor. ### Tips and Tricks - Always check the Property Editor settings before making adjustments in the Multi-Texture Editor. - Remember that desaturation will affect all layers unless turned off. --- ## 2. Blending Modes ### Overview of Blending Blending modes control how layers interact with each other visually, providing various effects. ### Step-by-Step Instructions 1. **Access Blending Options**: In the Multi-Texture Editor, select your texture and navigate to the 'Paint' section. 2. **Open Blend Menu**: Click on the 'Blend' dropdown menu to see different blending options. 3. **Choose a Blending Mode**: Select a blending mode that suits your design needs. ### Tips and Tricks - Experiment with different blending modes to achieve unique effects. - Keep a reference image of blending options for quick access (link provided in the original video). --- ## 3. Changing Canvas Size ### Importance of Canvas Size A larger canvas size allows for more detailed designs but may slow down performance. ### Step-by-Step Instructions 1. **Open Canvas Size Settings**: In the Multi-Texture Editor, locate the canvas size settings. 2. **Adjust Dimensions**: Set the canvas size to 1024x1024 pixels. 3. **Change Measurement Units**: If desired, switch from pixels to inches using the dropdown menu. 4. **Set Pixels Per Inch**: Change the PPI to 96. 5. **Fill Canvas**: To fill the canvas, either resize your texture or enable the 'Tile' option. ### Tips and Tricks - Monitor your system's performance when working with larger canvas sizes. - Use the 'Tile' feature to quickly fill the canvas without altering texture size. --- ## 4. Creating a Print from Scratch ### Adding Shapes You can create prints by importing shapes saved as PNG files. ### Step-by-Step Instructions 1. **Import Shape**: Click the 'Add' button and bring in your desired shape (e.g., stripe). 2. **Edit First Layer**: Make any necessary edits (e.g., color changes, opacity) in the first layer. 3. **Resize and Position**: Adjust the size and angle of your shape. 4. **Copy Layer**: Duplicate the first layer to maintain consistency. 5. **Lock Layers**: Lock layers to prevent accidental changes. 6. **Use Visibility Controls**: Use the eye icon to show/hide layers for easy selection. 7. **Extend Layers**: Select all layers and check ‘extend to other side’ if needed. ### Finalizing the Print 1. **Apply Changes**: Once satisfied with the print, hit 'Apply'. 2. **Resize Using Texture Editor**: Use the texture editor tool to resize the print in the 3D view rather than adjusting the canvas size. ### Tips and Tricks - Plan your design layout in advance to streamline the process. - Lock layers that are complete to avoid unintentional changes. --- ## 5. Saving and Accessing Your Work ### Step-by-Step Instructions 1. **Save Your Work**: Use 'File' > 'Open' to save your print as a flat image. 2. **Copy to Accessible Folder**: Always copy the file to a folder you can easily access. ### Tips and Tricks - Regularly save your work to prevent loss. - Keep your workspace organized by creating dedicated folders for projects. --- ## Conclusion This guide provides an overview of the advanced concepts in the Multi-Texture Editor, including the Property Editor's effects, blending modes, canvas size adjustments, and creating prints. By following the outlined steps and tips, users can enhance their workflow and create stunning textures efficiently."

        "publishedAt": "2021-04-13T10:09:37Z",
        "Transcript": "hello everyone hello welcome to cold home comfort public workshops and our topics is about basic streams making in code so here is our schedules our schedules have two sessions session a and session b session a will cover part one and part two which is about the custom button about 12 button and button uv map adoptions and part 2 is about ring and buckle creations from 2d patterns to 3d trims in code and session b is about the snap button creations and applications and the last part is about eyelet draw call and creations and applications for section 8 we will cover the custom button for part one so here is the garment field and we will do the practice on this change code yes and in this change code we will apply the custom button with uv map abductions like this one so before applying the uv map we need to add the buttons and i will share some tips for you about adding buttons and buttonholes along pattern outlined so you can go to clone and then firstly you can go to library and add today's materials so after you click add and you can go to desktop find session a materials just click one click and select the folder and then you see session a is added in the library so this is a shortcut for today's practice so you can double click on it to see we have two files one folder is for the materials about the buttons uv map another is the project files for today's practice so please double click to open these garment files okay so now you will get this screen and we will apply the buttons and button holes in cloud so please change two buttons please use button too to apply to the button first so i think all of you may be so familiar with adding buttons by left click and the tips we would like to share is about adding buttons along the outline so you can just right click on the pattern outline here and then you will see a part of windows and you can also preview the buttons and the outlines here so for these functions you can change the start positions of the buttons and also the replicate so for the distance for this practice i will use 18 for the distance and the interval will be changed to 30 and the replicate interval i will keep using 100mm and the number of the buttons i will change to free because we will add three buttons on the top so please use this setting and you can also preview the result in 2d and also 3d windows so you can click ok now so for this um these actions you can apply the buttons quickly with certain distance along the outline and then please change your buttonhole in 3d windows so you can click it and then move to here of this placket and also right click on it so you will also get a part of windows here for the buttonhole starting position stitch distance i will use 28. so you may wonder why we use 28 instead of 18 because we need to kind of the width of the zipper so i will use 28 mm and for the interval keep using 30 for gmm and the replicates interval you keep using 100 mm and the numbers will be free free or for the button holes and then you can click ok so now we have three buttons and button holes after that i will share another tips the tips second tips is about fasten all button at the same time so we can use fasten button tooth so please select fasten button 2 and for the transitional methods you can just click left click on the button and go to link with the button hole and to fasten them with at the same time you can left click and draw a area by dropping your mouse and then you will see your mouse with three arrows okay and then you can click on the first button hole so be careful you should select the corresponding button hole if you select this one maybe incorrect button hole and then the linkage will be incorrect so be careful you can just left click and then all the button will be fastened once and then you can go to simulate to see the results after fasten it so it may take some seconds and then you can turn off seamless after it becomes becomes stable okay and then i will go through about the custom uv map so what is custom what is the uv map purpose it is mainly for applied your custom textures and your logo on the code buttons and buttons uv map is in photoshop file format the uv map materials can be found in cloud library so you can go to cloud and then go to cloud library and hardware and chips you can double click on it and then you access these pages after that you can go to button and buttonhole file by double click so you use get free files here and today's main topics is about button uv texture so when you double click on it you will see there are a lot of psd file so how can you apply this psd file you can go back to the previous page by double click on this folder and then right click on button uv texture and copy the path while you click on it and copy the path and then you can open the documents windows and then place this address and press enter   and click enter so you can directly access this folder with uv map enclo library in your computer folders okay so i think you have already accepted this page and then we need to go back to cloud for doing some adjustment first so now we are using the default buttons so you can use select and move buttons to click it to see what buttons you are using so now you can see in object browser button and we are using the default buttons so you can click on it and go to property editor so in property editor you can change the shapes and other details of the buttons so today's you can choose the third buttons first button shapes in code and if you like to review the button shapes name you can just move your button and pawn at it and you can see the name of the button shapes okay so i will choose the style three buttons and then you see the button shapes is changed in 3d windows after that i will be open the button uv tester map folder so we include we provide different photoshop files so which one should we use you should use the photoshop files according to what shapes you are using what button shapes you are using and we suggest you to copy the files for the editing so that you won't replace the template and i also provide the materials in section a materials folder you can access part one to see the materials so we have two folders of two files this is the default one the template and i also have the demo so the campaigns will be like this you can see there are different sections including the front the back and also the buttonhole inside and what you need to do is to place you can just draw this materials in photoshop and apply it and you need to rescale it to place on it so after you have placed on it okay you also need to place the outside that means this area this area and also don't forget the back side and the buttonhole and the outcome will be like this one and this photoshop files i already put in the materials folder and you can use it afterwards so you can see we separate different layers for different sessions so this is easier for you to the further editing so after we have this materials we can apply it in code so i will go back to code windows and keep selecting object browser and default buttons and property editors and in here you can see there is a texture sessions so to apply the texture you can just open open the window and then go to desktop session a materials part one and then put the psd file there and open it so you will see the photoshop files it's added for the tester and also for the 3d windows the texture uv map with the logo and the unique texture is applied in 3d windows so we have already applied this in quick quick field step and some users may wonder if i want to edit in photoshop do i need to re-upload this texture file actually code in is compatible with photoshop files so if you do any editing you can just press f5 here this is another tips to refresh the texture in code once you edit the uv map in photoshop so we also include different samples of four types of buttons uv map okay so to fine tune the buttons you can see we also have the button thread so keep using the keep clicking the default buttons and the property editor and move to the thread section now and just left click on it and you see we are using the same materials at button you can just turn it off and then remove the texture for the thread and then you see the fret will become white color after that   you can go to color sessions and click on this box to change the color so you can use eyedropper to select the button color and then you can also edit for the future usage and click ok so for now we have finished the button and you may see the top buttons on the collar and you can see it is more natural because we have already changed the button hold shapes and also change the buttonhole color and the binding positions so how can we change the binding positions and also the buttonholes you can go to object browser and then click buttonhole to edit is properties so we are using default buttonhole now so please click on it and move to property editor at the bottom and you can change the shapes as you want and also change the color and other properties so you can also use eyedropper to select the color or use the color you added before and click ok and for changing the binding positions   you can keep using select move button tooth and then select all the button holes and move to property editor so you will see the binding position now we are using the default one which is 50 the values so you can just change the bar to change the values so you see when i change the values and the bar my buttonhole binding positions and will be changed so you can also type certain values like 60 in here in the binding positions and when you zoom in you can see it's become more natural of the binding positions and also for the 2d windows you also see a green point here this green point is representing your binding positions and then we finish the session a but you may see some buttons it's not stable so you can also turn on simulate to make it become more stable or reset the buttons   okay so now i think you already applied the buttons with uv map and then we will go to part two about wing and buckles creations and applications so you can see that this d-wing and also the buckles is actually created by code 2d patterns from cloud 2d patterns to 3d object so we will talk about the d-ring first and you can also see my demonstrations so before creating the the ring but during trims you can save the file save that project and then you can save as the folders on desktop section a materials and you can just change the file name practice and save it and after you save it you can create a new file by clicking file and new you create a new file for making strings so for this outfit we can just select it by select move tooth and then press delete to delete it so your 3d windows and 2d windows will be empty and then we will make the d-ring streams so for a easier preview and editing i suggest to zoom it in in 2d windows you can zoom in to see this cross and also 3d windows so you can see more details and edit it easily in both windows and then please use ellipse tubes and we will use ellipse tools for their creations so where can you find it you can left click and press here the fourth buttons for a few seconds and select ellipse tubes or you can also press e on your keyboard this shortcut to change to ellipse tubes now we need to create a circle you can left click on it to create a circle by sizing by diameters and the width and height will be 55 mm and 55 mm okay so you can just type it and you will see the circle on here and click ok and you will get a circle here so and then we need to use transform pattern 2. to do some fine tunings please click it please select this circle you create and go to property editors and change the particle distance from 5 to 1 mn you can just type the numbers and press enter and you will see there is a pop up windows so you can just click yes because we are now handling these find streams and patterns so particle distance in a more phallic won't affect the computer speeds and then we need to create an internal light for cutting these pieces to two so please use internal polygon and line tubes in 2d windows so you can zoom in to draw a internal lines at the middles so to finish it you can double click on it or pressing enter to finish the line creations and then you can use edit pattern tool to select this line and this line will be highlighted in yellow and right click on it and cut it white click to cut it so it will be separate to two pattern pieces and then we will use transform patterns to select the left hand side pieces and then just delete it you can press delete on your keyboard or right click on the patterns to delete it so we will have only half circle in 2d windows and then we will change to another app abducting tubes to smooth the corner so please press few seconds to change the tools to smooth curve so now you will change to this icon and this tubes so for changing the corner to a smooth corner you can left click and then jut your mouse if you late you have a certain values please keep clicking on the left click and then right click and you will find a pop-up windows so you can type the values of line 1 and line 2 to change its angles and i will use 2 mn and 2 mn for line 1 and i2 and if you would like to lock the ratios you can click this button to lock the ratios okay and then the curvature i will keep using 15 and click ok and you can also prefix the result in 2d windows and click ok so you find the corner will become more smooth and for the bottom and if you would like to save time you can just right click on the point right click on it and then the pop window will show directly and this time we also needed to type 2mm as we already locked the ratios so you just need to type 1 columns and click ok and now we have a half moon shapes after that please move to transform pattern tools so for the 2d patterns editing you may need to change different tools for different usage so please choose transform pattern tool to select all the outline and the whole patterns and then you can click right click on it and we will have offset as internal line please click on it and then we can offset the internal line according to the pattern outline so for the distance i will press 1mm i will enter 1mm and you can preview it and click ok so i will have a 1mm distance internal shapes like this and you can see the internal shape is highlighted in yellow color and you can right click on it and convert it to hole   so now i think you will get these shapes patterns and you can also zoom in to see the 3d windows to see the patterns and then we will do some fine tunes for the details so we will apply the thickness on the patterns so before applying the thickness we suggest you to turn on thick texture circuits in 3d windows to see the thickness of your patterns if you keep using the normal texture surface you won't see any thickness and then we can select the patterns and move to property editor and you will see there is a column about add fitness rendering now we are using zero values so please change to another values which is 1 mm 1n so after i change it you can see the 3d windows i have increased the thickness if you are not satisfied with the thickness you can keep increasing it like two to make it become more thick so the d-ring is complete and you can save the files by save as project please save it as project and you can save it as desktop for the usage or save as the session a materials and save here and i will name the file name as v1 so it is a project file types please save it so you can do future editing and import this file for the garments later on and i will explain it next sessions also please go to files and export and we will export as another file types for another usage and i will also explain the details later so please export it as obj object file export object and you can also find the files in section a materials in desktop and name the file name as the ring and you can see the file type is obj file and please save it and after you save it you will see there is a pop windows about obj export settings and please follow my settings about select all patterns in object and then single object and thick texture remember it's thick not thin and the scale will be mmsd default and for the ss i will keep the default settings and file i will save it as texture image with file path and you can click ok so when you open session 8 materials you will get this file and i will explain later on so for the followed practice i will introduce the buckle creations we will create the outer part and the inner part so the outer part will look like this one will have a frame and i will go through step by step so please create a new fox in code and you will have the empty windows now so for create a buckles you also need to use the create pattern tools so please press a second for changing the button uh the pattern creation tubes to rectangle and we will have a rectangle shapes creations okay so you can go to the center part in 2d and 3d windows and we always suggest you to place the patterns and draw the patterns over the y x axis like this one so it won't glow inside the ground so you can left click to create the rectangle and the size will be 40 mm times 60 mn the reef will be 40 and the height will be 60 and you can click ok and now you can get a rectangle patterns and then please use transform patterns to select this rectangle and go to property editor on right hand side and please change the particle distance to 1 just like this the step we did before one and press enter and also click yes   and then we can smooth the corner by using smooth curved tooth so you can just right click on the corner point and then you can lock the ratio first and change the values i will use 5 mm this time so you can also be filled the angle is more curved than before and click ok   and also please apply to the same setting for another corners type five mn to one the corner by length okay okay so you will see the result will be like this and then we create a hole so before i create a hole we need to have a internal lines so please use transform pattern to select the whole patterns so you can see all the outlines is highlighted and you can right click on it and offset as internal line and you will also see part windows and for the distance i will use 5 mm this time okay the number of offset is one and you can click ok so you have you have a rectangle in terms of shapes after that keep selecting it and then convert to hole so you will get these patterns like this and to have a other adjustment you can select these patterns and be careful don't select the inner part only you need to see let the whole pattern so you will see all of them will be highlighted in yellow in both 3d and 2d windows and you can move to property editor to change its thickness so this time we will use 5 and then for testing so you can see the thickness will be so thick the pattern thickness will be so thick in 3d windows so you can change to four to see another effect and if you would like to edit the edges curvature you can move to property editor and then go up her and you will find another column so now i think you already turned on the curvature side geometric and for editing the curvature you can edit the percentage like 50 and after changing the values you can see the edge effect is changed so for the largest values you provide the most curved appearance and for the smaller values you will see the shape is more sharpened the first part is complete and then for the inner part we will create the inner part for the buckles so before creating this part as rectangle patterns we need to check the height so how can we check the height you can use edit pattern edit pattern this time to select the line so i will select the internal line height so you can see the values is 50 in three and in 2d windows and also property editor so you know the height and you can start to create the rectangle patterns for the inner part so please go to rectangle please use rectangle tools to create the rectangles you can just draw it or left click to type certain values for creating the rectangles the riff will be 3mm and the height will be 50 and if you draw the rectangle by hand make sure the height should be larger than 50 you can't before okay so after clicking ok you have the new patterns and then please use transform pattern 2. to select both of them the inner part and the outer part so they are all highlighted and please right click on them and then move to aligned and we need to align these patterns please click align and then center align center and the patterns will be aligned as center and also right click again to align the needles so you can now see the patterns in 2d windows are perfectly matched according to the center and the middle so for the 3d windows they are not aligned so you need to click reset 2d arrangement or in 3d windows so these buttons help your 3d patterns arrangement follow the 2d patterns windows arrangement so they will be aligned so after you click on it you can see they are all the same and then we can have some fine tuning for the inner part just select it and move to property editor and change the particle distance to 1 and then click yes and then you can change the thickness of rendering and i suggest the values will be around 1mm you can also adjust the values as you want according to your design and you need to make sure you are turning on thick texture service see the thickness and now we have these buckles so please save it as a project files save it as project file like last time we create the ring and the file name i will name it as buckle and the file type will be project file and you can click save and also don't forget to export it as obj maybe you may wonder what is the difference between obj and obj selected actually obj will cover will export all the obj the patterns and the alpha in your project files and obj selected just for selecting certain patterns just like the frame and you can click export obj selected to export the frame only if you don't select the inner part you won't export it so this time i will keep using export obj for export order patterns at the same time and then the file name will be buckled and click save and this time the setting will be the same as last time and click ok and then we have already created this buckles and d wing and for the last part i will cover the trims applications we have three methods so the first method it's about common file with freeze and we all i also list out some difference between these three methods so i will go through one by one and i will go for the first method first so what we need is a garment file and the load type will be add okay so please go to session a materials you can open the project file you save by double click and the open project type will be open and with garment and alpha and click ok so you will see the change code file again and now we will apply the buckles so you already save the buckle in project file and also obj files so i will use the buckle in project file instead prj and you can right click on it and add to workspace remember right click on it and add to workspace and the setting   will be add project load type will be added project type will be gone and click ok   and you will see a window asking you about loading the alpha post and size file press no so after adding this buckle files you will see the buckles will be added in both 3d and 2d windows at the bottom so this place is according to your file saving and the creation in code here you see the adjustment in 3d windows and 2d windows in this method we can do the adjustment in both windows but you need to freeze all of them and when you do the adjustment or the move movement just like the position adjustment you need to confirm you are you clicking all the patterns at the same time and then freeze it after that you can just move it by gizmo tooth or the tag tool just click on it and fine-tune the positions in 3d windows like this way and our tips is to zoom in and change the angles the few angles according to your knees and then around putting the buckles on the belt here in front of the belt and how can we make sure the um the belt is passed through the buckles you can use select mesh tools both in 3d windows ok and how can we find the belt positions you can just click left click on it to draw an area so the area you select is highlighted in green and then you can move to 2d pattern windows and zoom in and you will find the belt patterns is on the top and you can also find the selected area in green and then you can see let again to draw the area like this one and adjust the search and mesh positions by gizmo two so to put it out we suggest you to use the blue arrow okay and then turn on simulations to see the effect and stop simulations and you can also use select move to go back to select boot tooth in 3d windows to see the result so now you can see the patterns is passed through by the dreams by using method bomb and if you would like to change the patterns gap or the collisions you need to select them the buttons are the buckles patterns and go to property editors you can still adjust it in both 3d and 2d windows and then change the add thickness collisions to make the gap become more thinner and i will change to 1mm so actually there are not standard values for the collisions it depends on your buckles or your trims thickness so you can turn on simulate to see the result is more fined than before like this way so this is the first way of the team's applications and then for the second one i will go through the method of obj and load as alpha term so this method we need is about obj files so that's why i asked you to save two files type so this time we will load as alpha term so please go back to the cloud windows and you can use silet and move two to delete the patterns of the buckles and we will try the second method and it may take some time to remove it okay and after that we will add another materials about a code object please right click and add to workspace right click on the butt code object and add tuber space and you will see the window it's about the information to add the obj the load type is added and the object type will be load as alpha term and the scale i will keep using mn because we saved mm for this trim scale before and click ok   so now you see the buckle object is load and added in 3d windows and in 2d windows it is invisible so you can do the adjustment in 3d windows only so for this time the difference with method 1 you can click any point on the trees and move all the patterns and the object at one time so you can use the gizmo tool to move it   okay and also zoom in to see the details okay and then you can also put on the same area like last time and then another difference with method one you can change the scale in 3d windows directly by clicking these twos on left hand side next to the gizmo after you click it you see your gizmo tooth will change to the scaled setting you can just rescale it by a biracial or just change the height or the width and also the thickness in blue arrow so if you would like to change the position again you need to turn the scale tooth off okay and then for this time if you want to pass through make your belt patterns pass through the buckles you also need to use select mesh box and then you see the mesh is appear and you can select it in 3d windows the highlighted area represent in both 3d and 2d windows and you can select again the certain areas in 2d windows and then click on 3d windows left click to show the gizmo tooth and then put it out after that you can turn on simulate   and then the pattern of belt will pass through the buckles and you can click select move tools to see the result and turn off the select mesh mode but when you zoom in you can see there are some gap between the trims and the patterns so you can use silhouette and move tooth to select the trims and then it will highlighted in 3d windows and you can go to property editors and change the skin offset so now we are using three mm so we should decrease the values to one mn and simulate again to see and you can see the gap will be decreased and you can also change to smaller values to make it get closer to the patterns so for the comparison the collisions you can see method one and method two their collision setting is in different names but the purpose are the same okay and then i will talk about the last methods it is about the obj file type with load as streams okay and then for here i will add a d-ring for the end of the belt so this time please right-click on the d-ring object and add to workspace and also the load type will be add and object type please select load as strings scale will be mn as default and click ok and you will also see the trim is added in the 3d windows only so the difference between between the second method and this method you can not only use sorry edit again the difference is about the dreams owns the good truth so you see the difference in our chart so this method not only provides a gift motif for adjustment in 3d windows but also the glue tools and glue troops provide the methods for you to stick the dreams on patent service so you can have the interruptions and the movement while doing the simulations okay so now you can see here is the glue tools on the right hand side next to the gizmo tubes you can just click it turn it on and then move the window and click on the pattern directly on the belt okay so this area okay you can submit to this area to do some fine tunings of the positions when you turn on simulate you can see the dreams have some interactions and will follow the pattern's movement and if you want to adjust the positions you can also use the gizmo tube and change the angles a display so this method is mainly for the patterns with some interactions uh the trims with some interactions with the patterns like the rings buttons zippers and you can also be scared of your trees like this after we applied it we can change its materials type and color in property editors you can change the type now we are using mat and you can change to plastic or metallic and i will use metal for demo so you see there is a demo d wing and for changing the color you can keep changing the setting in property editors to click the box and then change the color you can use eyedropper to drop the color and click ok and for the buckles you can also select it and then change its properties in property editors like changing the materials type to plastic this time and then change the color to the olive color like this one so you can have the more details on the trees after these streams creations and also applications and i think you will note more about the object create in cloud the dreams create in cloud and if you would like to see the difference you can rebuild our handouts and also provide some examples for different methods just like method one you can use buckles used for buckles and ring creations and method two is the same as method one includes the buckles and ring creations and for method 3 is about the ring super slider poor button eyelets ribbon cotton glitter etc so i hope this chart will provide you with more information you ",

        "Transcript": "welcome back for part two of the public workshop in part one we learn about the procedure of making animation using the provided materials in part 2 we're going to apply motions from maximo which is an online resources and build a simple backdrop with patterns the first step on my screen we already opened a female v2 actor and this time i'm going to create an animation based on a spot square so i'll go to shoes and change her shoes from heels to sneakers next go to file i'll export the obj now i'm exporting the avatar as an obj as you can see the settings i have to select all the avatars save it as single object keep it in mind and the scale will remain to be default i'm going to save all the textual image in a zip file then click ok to export as you can see i already have the sports fave in a zip file dolby j now we're ready to go to maximum so maximo is on my platform from adobe and they provide several free characters and animation to download the first step i will upload an avatar as you can see that they provide fbx obj and also zip file to upload i'll simply drag my whole zip file to load avatar after loading the avatar i'll go to the page of octo record now go to the next step and i need to place this mars according to this reference image because i'm using the symmetry so only need to place for one side and go to the next step so why do we need to do the octo rigging is because the motions of the advertise basically controlled by something like skeleton which we call rig and each system has their own method to write the avatar if we want to use the animation provided in maximo we have to write the glow avatar again to make sure that the skeleton fits with those animation after auto-raking if your advertised movement looks natural in human life we can go to the next step before applying with the animation i'll download the avatar in the original post first save the format as fbx in original post next i can apply with the animation you can click on different options to reveal how your avatar look i'm going to search for a jumping motion and to right hand side you can see there are several settings allowed us to adjust the movement the first one is overdrive overdrive refers to the duration of your motion with a lower value the movement will be slower the second one character arm space which is the most important settings it refers to the space between the avatar arm and of the body we have to make sure that there are enough space that no body part should touch with each other or else it may cause garment collision when you generate your animation in call and then i'm ready to download make sure that the format stays as fbx so all in total there are two files that we should have saved the first one is the auto rig avatar in the original post and then the second one is the avatar applied it with the jumping motion now we can go back to chloe and i'll delete this existing after and then import the avatar applied with motion when i import this fbx i have to ensure that the animation is also included i can go to this animation mode and click display button to preview the movement so basically for this file i'm going to use the motion so go to file save as joint motion as you can see it will be saved as a motion file in mtn format after that i can remove this avatar next step i'll import the sports fever avatar which is the one in the original pose keep the default setting for the animation i will let after to wear a sportswear so before i add this garment file inside to my workspace i have to make sure my avatar is located in center then go to the material folder and find a spot where add it to your workspace and add the butter for bad draw basically everything that you see is displayed in the 2d pattern window the backdrop are created by patterns and i have some extra small pieces which is the freeze pattern to help holding the shape of my bedroom in these images i applied it as a graphic let's use the floor as an example find this white wood floor jpeg file right click and add it as graphic if you want to adjust the size of this graphic you have to use the transform guard too select the graphic and then drag to rescale so don't release your mouse and right click at the same time to find this transform window i'll enlarge it to 900 percentage and then i'll make a repeat by right click tau pattern so this graphic will bleed over all of the pattern if you have some props which is created by autocad if they are in obj or fbx file it's also compatible let's say the thumb belt i'll load it as avatar and the low tide make sure it's at so switch back to the select move too in order to touch or move your after i'll arrange the position by the help of gizmo 2. you can change to different wheel angle for this obj it's also possible to adjust the material type and also color and basically we're ready to apply with the motion before that as we mentioned in part 1 we have to check the garment setting so the particle distance of our garment should be within the range of eight to ten in all layers is set to zero and a collision thickness set as 2.5 and then for our avatar skin of subtree and a static friction set to one and i'll also check for the backdrop as you can see some part of the yoga mat is touching with the avatar to prevent garment collision i'll move all the backdrops a little downward and freeze the floor and also the yoga mat and then i can apply with the motion file as i save the motion file in the original material folder and it is in mtn file format double click to apply and you have to select the avatar because we have two the dumbbell and also the sports vp choose sports baby switch to animation mode in your animation editor now we only have the transition motion and also the jumping motion so i'll click this record button to also generate the motion of your garment and you can take a look of the remaining time to estimate how long you still need to wait when we finish the recording you can see we also have the garment movement and i'll adjust the play region this blue bar to exclude the transition motion and basically we're ready to generate our export setting but before that i'll switch back to the simulation mode and unfreeze the floor and the yoga mat basically there are two ways to export an animation video the first way is video capture if you want to use the video capture function you have to use the animation mode you can find a video capture from file video capture animation for this method basically it captures everything we see in our 3d window so we have to make sure that this kind of baseline and internal lines is invisible so go to your 3d garmin display and hide your internal lines and also based on and i will change to fake texture surface in order to see the thickness of the garment and even the ground we have some 3d grid we need to hide it as well hide the 3d grid and then i can start to do the video capture the video size can be addressed by preset and different orientation for video codec make sure that you're using the xfit mpeg-4 the file format can be opened in most devices so it's more preferable and then i can start to record this recording time refers to the actual time of your video when the button turns to red i can start recording play to review your video it will be saved in avi video format so you can see this is how it looks if you use the video capture to generate your video for this method is the fastest way to export video however the quality is relatively less high if you compare it with the render exportation now we're going to try the second method which is rendering to render a video you can find render and open your render window the first step is to start interactive rendering hello same as what we can adjust for a render image if you use the rendering method to generate your video you'll be able to adjust the light settings as well which the video capture is able to do and let's say i'm happy with the light settings already i like to go to the image video properties and set to generate an animation remember to click the box of save video or else you'll be saving a bunch of render image only and the image size will be the size of your animation and scroll down and find the video codec you have to use the exfit and platform and when you're satisfied we can stop render and do the final rendering so image and also video will be saved and you can improve comparing with the video capture you can see that clearly if you do the rendering the quality is quite high however is more time consuming so it really depends on your need and the quality desired and that's it for the public workshop and hope you enjoy have a good time and apply these tricks on your own animation include thank you you ",

Go to the **Octo Rig** section. ### Step 4: Rigging the Avatar 1. **Position the Markers**: Place markers according to a reference image (use symmetry; only place for one side). 2. **Auto-Rigging**: This process ensures that the avatar's skeleton aligns with Maximo's animation requirements. 3. **Preview Movement**: Ensure the avatar's movement appears natural. ### Step 5: Download the Rigged Avatar 1. Save the rigged avatar in the original pose: - Format: **FBX** - Save it. ### Step 6: Apply Animation 1. **Search for Animation**: Look for a \"jumping motion.\" 2. **Settings**: - **Overdrive**: Adjust the duration (lower values = slower motion). - **Character Arm Space**: Ensure adequate space between arms and body to prevent collisions. 3. Download the animated avatar as FBX. ## Part 3: Importing and Finalizing Animation ### Step 7: Import the Animated Avatar 1. In your animation software, delete any existing avatars. 2. Import the animated avatar (ensure that animation is included). 3. Preview the animation by clicking the **Display** button. ### Step 8: Save Motion File 1. Go to **File** -> **Save As** -> **Joint Motion**. - Save as an MTN file format. ### Step 9: Import Base Avatar 1. Import the original pose avatar (sports fave). 2. Ensure the avatar is centered. ## Part 4: Designing the Backdrop ### Step 10: Add Backdrop Patterns 1. **Add Materials**: Navigate to the material folder and add a backdrop pattern. 2. **Adjust Graphics**: - For example, to add a white wood floor image: right-click and add as graphic. - Use the Transform tool to adjust size (hold right-click to access transform window). - Resize to 900% and apply as a repeating pattern. ### Step 11: Adjust Props (Optional) 1. If you have props (like a dumbbell), load them as avatars. 2. Use the Select Move tool to position props using the gizmo. ### Step 12: Check Garment Settings 1. Ensure particle distance is between 8-10. 2. Set all layers to zero and collision thickness to 2.5. 3. Set static friction to 1. ### Step 13: Prevent Garment Collision 1. Adjust the position of backdrops to prevent overlaps with the avatar. 2. Freeze the floor and yoga mat. ## Part 5: Applying and Recording Motion ### Step 14: Apply the Motion File 1. Double-click the saved MTN file to apply it to the sports avatar. 2. Switch to the animation mode. ### Step 15: Record Animation 1. Click the **Record** button to capture the garment movement. 2. Monitor the remaining time for recording. ### Step 16: Adjust Play Region 1. Adjust the blue play region to exclude any unnecessary motion (like transitions). ## Part 6: Exporting the Animation ### Step 17: Choose Export Method - **Method 1: Video Capture** 1. Go to **File** -> **Video Capture Animation**. 2. Hide internal lines and 3D grids to clean up the visual. 3. Adjust video size and codec settings (use Xfit MPEG-4). 4. Start recording when ready (recording time = actual video length). - **Method 2: Rendering** 1. Open the render window. 2. Start interactive rendering and adjust lighting if necessary. 3. Set to generate animation and check the save video box. 4. Stop render to save image and video. ## Tips and Tricks - Always save your work frequently to avoid losing progress. - Use reference images for accurate rigging and placement. - Experiment with different motions and settings to see what works best for your animation. - When adding graphics, ensure they are properly scaled and aligned for the best visual effect. - Test animations frequently to ensure smooth transitions and avoid collisions. ## Conclusion This comprehensive guide has walked you through the process of creating animations using Maximo and designing backdrops. By following the steps outlined, you should be able to create engaging animations for your projects. Enjoy applying these techniques to your own animations!"

        "Transcript": "hello everyone thank you for joining our second time online public workshop for today we will focus on how to make animation in cloud we will divide it into two parts the first part we will just demonstrate the general procedure making animation including loading the motion and then how to use the animation mode and how to capture a brief video of your catwalk show that is the first part the second part will focus on some advanced technique to customize your animation so let us start it for this garment it is completed but before you make it as animation you have some preparation so we can have a look on this document as preparation you will have several things you need to check before you start to make it as animation including first of all go to your property editor to make sure the particle distance is incorrect value normally if it is a single layer government it can be x to 10 mm or if it is a multiple layer government it can be 10 to 20 mm it depends on the situation you are encountered secondly please make sure the layer value of your garment are in zero because layers is only for you to make the pattern in order at the moment it is time for use and after you use it you need to make it back to all value as zero and the back um the pattern came back to original color thirdly the value of active thickness collision of your government will be different between making animation and high-res government because when you hire the government by the high-res government tool it will turn the ad infamous collision to one but for animation it will be more stable if you change it to 2 to 2.5 and you can remain it to the original file the default value or you can click low rest garment if you already hi-resin after the property editor we can check with the fabric physical property because if the fabric is too stiff it will be unstable when you do animation therefore make sure that first to set value of your physical property details will be lower than 60 lower than 60 to ensure it had a stable animation and you can go to the 3d window to check whether any patterns are in strengthen freeze and the artifacts remember those three functions are only for you to use it as temporary and supporting your 3d modeling after you have used it you need to turn it off as the original phone in the meantime make sure no pin is attached to hold your garment when doing simulation finally please return the simulation modes as the default one because the fitting accuracy is only used when you do fitting and for animation default one will be more stable as a remark if you think your garment is unstable when doing simulation you can go to the 3d toolbar and use the after tip tool helping you to hold a part of your garment stick on your avatar when the motion is loaded for example you can have a look on the shoulder line i'm going to draw a line here and use that line to attach the same line to show the same line of the pattern on it and after a turn on simulation even though a motion is loaded it will restricted on your after helping you to enhance the stability when the after is in a cab or show meanwhile if it is needed you can attach accessories on the after such as the earring but you will find that if you load that obj file as load as stream you cannot directly attached it on the after and for this case you can have a look on the procedure here by using another pattern and with the task function to achieve the results attaching the accessories indirectly on your after okay after your project is well prepared we can go to the next step would be to add emotion on your after and we can have a look here first of all we can go to the library and go to the after and because this after comes from the folder of female version two therefore we need to click back into female version two and find the folder of motion motion within the motion folder you have several default motions for you to load it on the the provided after and you can just double click and load one of the motion and after you double click it you will have already load this motion on your after with the after is placed at the side of the 3d window which means it is ready to walk in the meantime you can load a stage inside your current file as the backdrop for the catwalk show after you load it you can see your after is behind the backdrop and ready for the cab will show after it is loaded you can customize it for example the color or the texture etc how can you do that is you can go back to your 3d window select one of the backdrop after you select it you can go to the property editor and see what the image is attached in the column of texture that image is the surface of your backdrop by revising that image maybe in other software like photoshop and then you can get a revised customized background in the meantime you can also select one of the logo around the um stage like the clone logo at the side and then select the property of it like you can change it as another logo or you can just um set the opacity to zero to make it transparent okay after the backdrop is also ready you can really switch to animation mode the animation mode and start to record your catwalk show by just clicking the record icon because if you can click another thing like the simulation icon you get error when you recording the animation so just make sure after you switch it to animation mode the first thing you do is to just click that animation icon when the record function is turned on which means your feeder is stopped generating and you can have a look on your model itself it is walking slowly from the backdrop and after a few seconds or few minutes you got the results as following okay your video is completed and you can have a look here first of all you can click those button to refill your video in the meantime you'll see your arrow at the bottom is running which means where you are watching and under your animation mode you can have a look here we have two video clips the garment and the transition normally we will not do any adjustment on the two columns but just let you know we have that 2 video clip constructing your catwalk show and more details are shown on the top of that 2 video clip including the type of your video as real time or not and the current time show which scene you are stopping of your video when you are preferring and the end time shown the total length of your video itself lastly you will have a option of since time well which means to the speed of your video for example the default value will be 1 which means that is a normal speed but if you change the value to 2 your video will be much slower and then your video will be in double time the length will be longer you can change the display you need for details as a remark if you would like to make a draft before finalization of your animation you can go to simulation quality and change it to normal defaults it is used for drafting after driving of course you need to go back to custom as the finalization okay after your video is recorded of course we can use random to render it out but it will be discussed in the next section and for this session we will just focus on few more reminder for the first reminder is how you can change it back to the original post or to the original ground assets it's really simple is you just need to go back to the original simulation mode and right click your after and move it back to the original assets as another reminder would be you like to change it back to some other post it's also really simple after you um put it back to the center of your ground you just need to go back to its corresponding folder of after and click post inside there's a folder uphold you can double click one of your preference and load it and the post will be changed and the animation motion will be deleted deleted if you like to add a new motion of course you need to click emotion and select it again and there are two reminders for you for making animation and that is the end of the first session of today's um public workshop for the second session we'll focus on the customized animation techniques and how to do rendering and see you soon you ",
        "Summary": "# Comprehensive Guide to Creating Animation in the Cloud ## Overview This guide will provide you with step-by-step instructions, definitions, and tips for creating animations in a cloud-based environment, as presented in a public workshop. The workshop is divided into two parts: 1. Basic Animation Procedure 2. Advanced Animation Techniques and Customization --- ## Part 1: Basic Animation Procedure ### Step 1: Preparation Before Animation Before starting your animation, ensure the following settings are correct: 1. **Check Particle Distance**: - Open the **Property Editor**. - Set the **Particle Distance**: - For single-layer garments: **2-10 mm**. - For multiple-layer garments: **10-20 mm**. 2. **Reset Layer Values**: - Ensure the **Layer Values** for your garment are set to **zero**. This is important for pattern organization. 3. **Adjust Active Thickness Collision**: - Set the **Active Thickness Collision** value: - For high-resolution garments, adjust to **2-2.5** for stability during animation. 4. **Fabric Physical Properties**: - Set the **Physical Property** values of your fabric to **lower than 60** to ensure stable animation. 5. **Check for Freezing and Artifacts**: - Inspect the **3D Window** for any patterns that are frozen or have artifacts. Disable temporary functions after use. 6. **Remove Pins**: - Ensure no pins are holding your garment during simulation. 7. **Set Simulation Mode**: - Return to the default **Simulation Mode** for better stability during animation. ### Step 2: Loading Motion 1. **Load Your Avatar**: - Navigate to the **Library** and find your avatar (e.g., Female Version 2). - Double-click to load the motion from the **Motion Folder**. 2. **Set Up the Stage**: - Load a backdrop for the catwalk show. - Customize the backdrop’s texture and logos via the **Property Editor**. ### Step 3: Switch to Animation Mode 1. **Enter Animation Mode**: - Switch to **Animation Mode**. - Click the **Record Icon** to start capturing your catwalk show. 2. **Monitor the Recording**: - Ensure that the model walks from the backdrop. - The video will be generated as you record. ### Step 4: Review Your Video 1. **Playback and Edit**: - After recording, use the playback controls to review your video. - Check the two video clips: **Garment** and **Transition**. 2. **Adjust Video Speed**: - Change the speed of the video using the **Speed Setting** (default is **1** for normal speed). 3. **Drafting and Finalization**: - For drafts, change **Simulation Quality** to **Normal**. - Return to **Custom** for final rendering. ### Step 5: Returning to Original Settings 1. **Reset Avatar Position**: - Right-click your avatar and move it back to original assets. 2. **Change Avatar Post**: - Return to the corresponding folder and load a new post. 3. **Add New Motion**: - If needed, click on the motion option and select a new motion to add. --- ## Part 2: Advanced Animation Techniques and Customization *Note: This section will focus on advanced customization techniques and rendering, which will be discussed in the next session of the workshop.* --- ## Tips and Tricks - **Use the After Tip Tool**: This tool can help stabilize parts of your garment during simulation. - **Adjustments on Accessories**: If you cannot directly attach an accessory to your avatar, use another pattern and the task function to attach it indirectly. - **Check Stability**: If your garment appears unstable during animation, return to the **3D Toolbar** and adjust settings as necessary. - **Utilize External Software**: For backdrop customization, consider using software like Photoshop for better textures and images. - **Save Your Work**: Regularly save your project to prevent loss of progress. --- ## Definitions - **Particle Distance**: The distance between particles in a garment that affects simulation stability. - **Active Thickness Collision**: A setting that affects how the garment interacts with the avatar during animation. - **Physical Property**: Attributes of the fabric that dictate how it behaves in simulation. - **Animation Mode**: A specific mode for capturing motion and creating animated sequences. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of creating animations in a cloud-based environment, from preparation to execution. Follow these steps to successfully create and customize your animations."
