        "Summary": "### Comprehensive Guide to Creating Super Realistic Knit Using Cloth Ready This guide outlines the step-by-step process of creating realistic knitted textures using the \"Cloth Ready\" feature. It includes definitions, instructions, and practical tips to enhance your workflow. --- #### Step-by-Step Instructions: 1. **Accessing the Knit Material:** - Open your software and navigate to the **Property Editor** located on the right side of your workspace. - Look for the **Knit Material** option. This is where you will find the different settings to customize your knit texture. 2. **Choosing Knit Options:** - Once you have selected the Knit Material, you will see various options: - **Type of Stitching:** Choose from different stitching patterns (e.g., ribbed, garter, stockinette). - **Density of Knit:** Adjust the density to change how tightly the knit appears. A higher density results in a tighter knit. - **Thickness of Yarn:** Select the thickness of the yarn to vary the appearance and realism of the knit. 3. **Using Multiple PES:** - You can add multiple **PES (Patterned Elements)** in different colors. This layering technique allows for a more complex and realistic knit appearance. - To do this, simply select the additional PES options and customize them as needed. 4. **Flipping the Pattern:** - To change the direction of your knit pattern, rotate it 90¬∞ in the **2D Window**. - This will alter the orientation of the knitting, giving you control over the design. 5. **Generating Seams:** - For seams, you can create custom curvatures. This feature allows you to define how seams interact with the knit material, adding realism and depth. - Adjust the curvature settings in the Property Editor to match your design. 6. **Optimizing Viewport Performance:** - To enhance your workflow and speed up the rendering process: - Disable the knitware in the viewport while working on other elements. This will reduce lag and improve performance. - Remember to turn the knitware back on when you are ready for the final render. #### Definitions: - **Knit Material:** A specialized digital texture that simulates the look and feel of knitted fabrics. - **PES (Patterned Elements):** Individual pattern components that can be layered or combined to create complex textures. - **Viewport:** The area in your software where you can view and manipulate your 3D model in real-time. - **Curvature:** The degree of bend in the seams, affecting how they appear on the knitted fabric. #### Tips and Tricks: - **Experiment with Colors:** Try different color combinations for your PES to achieve unique and visually appealing results. - **Use Reference Images:** Look at real knitted fabrics for inspiration on color schemes, stitch patterns, and densities. - **Test Renders:** Conduct regular test renders to see how your adjustments affect the overall look of the knit texture. - **Keep an Organized Workflow:** Label your layers and materials clearly, especially when using multiple PES, to avoid confusion later in the design process. - **Utilize Layers:** Consider using layers in your software for different elements of the knit, such as background, stitches, and seams, for easier adjustments. --- By following these instructions and utilizing the tips provided, you should be well-equipped to create super realistic knitted textures using the Cloth Ready feature. Happy creating!"

        "publishedAt": "2024-05-23T10:11:47Z",
        "Transcript": "hello this is the connect team we've just launched 18 new shoe lasts for adult CL Avatar shoe designs these Sho LS are suitable for both male and female adults and come in three toe types round square and stiletto they are categorized into two height types one for low shoes like sneakers and another for high shoes like boots additionally we offer lasts specifically for creating women's he s available in three toe types and two height variations please check the description for the link to obtain the shoe lasts now let's learn how to create sneakers and heels using these newly released Sho lasts let's open the women's flat shoe last round file purchased from connect when opening a file you can access it directly from the my item menu in the connect and cl of close's Library window or or if you have downloaded it locally you can unzip the file and then drag and drop it into CL the locally downloaded Sho last zip file provides two files the Sho avt file and a project containing both the Sho avt and the insole pattern to use the project file you must unzip the downloaded file and then use the zpj file located inside the folder to efficiently work with the shoe project it's best to use the zpj file that includes the insole pattern we will now open this cprj file by dragging and dropping it into CL once you open the file the 3D window will automatically load both the right and left lasts these lasts provide pre-marked 3D pen lines along the center and edges by default this default setup helps streamline the design process making it more convenient additionally an insole pattern that con the upper and the outsole is provided to efficiently reduce the steps in this shoe creation process before starting to create the shoes if you are making a symmetrical pair of shoes you only need to work on one side in this tutorial we will Design or create the symmetrical sneakers utilizing the right shoe last for easier view control we will delete the left insole pattern and set the transparency of the left shoe last to zero to hide it to create sneakers we will use the 3D pen tool along with the flatten feature let's start by selecting the 3D pen tool and drawing design lines on the shoe last select the 3D pen Avatar tool this tool functions similarly to the pattern creation tool by clicking the left Mouse button on the Avatar you can create points and draw Lines by connecting these points points simply click to create segment points if you want to create curve points hold down the control key while clicking the left Mouse button to finish the line doubleclick on the last point to create a pattern using the flatten feature the lines drawn with a 3D pen must touch each other without gaps therefore when finishing a line please double click on the existing line after drawing the lines with the 3D pen you can fine-tune them using the edit 3D pen Avatar tool adjust the sneaker design Lines by moving the existing points to clean up the design if you need more points for detailed adjustments rightclick at the desired location to add either a segment or curve point once all sneaker design lines are drawn we will use the flatten feature to convert them into patterns when you turn them into patterns the lines you've drawn will become seam lines if you do not want seam lines on the existing center lines delete them using the edit H 3D pen Avatar tool before flattening press and hold the 3D pen Avatar tool to select the flatten tool when you move to the shoe last with design lines you can see the areas based on the lines become active select all the areas you want to convert into patterns and press enter to create the patterns it is recommended to select all the areas at once and press enter as this automatically sews the seam line together making the process more efficient once the sneaker patterns have been created organize their position within the pattern window for easier editing when organizing it is helpful to arrange the sewn line segments to face each other which makes work easier you can easily find the facing line segments using the picking Point feature in the 3D window after organizing the patterns lower the patterns particle distance value to 3 mm to smooth out the shape of the sneakers then apply strengthen connect the sewing lines with the insole pattern and run the simulation when patterns are created using the flatten feature they are made based on the lines generated along the surface of the Avatar in the 3D window so the lines of the patterns in the 2D window might not be neat if you desire cleaner lines please use the edit tools in the pattern window to adjust the lines and refine the patterns more precisely once the sneaker patterns are organized and finalized please apply Fabrics to the patterns you can try different fabrics for each part of the pattern to see which ones best suit your design let's add the tongue and shoelaces to our sneakers first to make the tongue duplicate the upper pattern and modify it into a tongue pattern adjust layer order to ensure the tongue sits underneath the upper adjust the layer setting by assigning a negative value organizing the order of the pattern e this time let's add shoelace if you have an existing shoelace import additional files please refer to the video Linked In the card for how to make shoelace creates a hole that matches the imported shoelace it would be appropriate to add two more shoelace lines to the current sneakers so let's add them e if you want to add more detail to the sneakers consider including top stitching as a Finishing Touch once you are satisfied with the design of the sneaker upper save your progress by saving the project file shoes typically have an outsole and a simple outsole can be created as a pattern in Clow for designs that are too complex to create with a pattern please create them as 3D models and add them to CL let's add a simple outsole to the sneaker we will utilize the existing insole pattern for the outsole select the insole pattern and choose layer clone over now you can see that the pattern has been cloned below the existing insole pattern select the outsole pattern and enter the desired height for the outsole into both the Collision thickness and rendering thickness if the sides of the pattern are too curved and you want to reduce the curvature you can either turn off off the curved side geometry menu or reduce the curvature value once you're satisfied with the shape apply the desired fabric to the outsole pattern once the outsole design is complete delete both shoe last and upper patterns before the simulation to elevate outsole design above the 3D grid and cl please make sure to save the completed outsole design project previous to the following steps then reload the project file containing the upper design use the ad project menu to specify the y- AIS value to match the height of the outsole this will position the upper and the shoe last correctly above the outsole save the current project under a different name to preserve this version of the sneaker design to fit the sneakers you've worked onto the CL Avatar you need to adjust the Avatar's position relative to the sneakers the Sho last is completely level with a 3D grid but since the CL Avatar is slightly elevated for pattern simulation we will adjust the CL Avatar to be level with the 3D grid first we will clear the workspace and open the clo female Avatar since we are creating sneakers we will remove the heels that the Avatar is currently wearing then by right clicking on the Avatar in the 3D window and selecting move Avatar to ground the Avatar will be positioned right on the 3D grid we will then save this as the new Avatar file avt when making shoes it's essential to cover them with an invisible dummy to ensure stable simulation of the shoes and clothes without a dummy mesh the clothing pattern can be stuck on the uneven surface of the shoes during the simulation which makes it difficult to style the outfit to look natural let's start by opening the shoe last file to create the dummy select and flatten all areas except the insole to ensure the dummy mesh covers the entire shoe and leave a gap between the shoe last and the dummy mesh for easier wrapping to create this Gap increase the skin offset value adjusting it generously based on the thickness of the shoe for the sneakers we're currently making which are not made of thick fabric we will set it to about 13 mm and then connect the sewing lines to the insole apply strengthen to the pattern and run the simulation a denser mesh on the dummy helps handle collisions with clothing patterns placed over the shoes more reliably however setting it too low can affect the file size of the shoe so we will moderately reduce the particle distance to about 10 mm save this as a project file then open the saved sneakers project file and add the dummy project file making sure to load only the Garment in the options window delete the insole linked to the dummy pattern and connect the sewing line to the sneakers outsole since the sneakers do not need to be simulated freeze the entire sneaker pattern apply strengthen to the dummy pattern and then simulate it if any part of the sneaker pattern protrudes beyond the dummy pattern you can adjust the layer value of the entire enire dummy pattern before simulation to ensure it covers the sneakers externally if there is no skin offset value on the shoel parts of the dummy pattern may penetrate into the Sho last select the Sho last and slightly increase the skin offset to allow the dummy pattern to come to the surface once the dummy pattern completely covers the sneakers please make it Invisible by selecting the fabric applied to the dummy pattern and setting the Fabric's opacity value to zero this covers up the process for making shoes and cl let's save the project file again to set your sneakers work seamlessly with close Avatar poses or motion files you must register them as a CL accessory file to register as a clo accessory file you must open the clo default Avatar and adjust its position with your last saved sneakers project open add the previously ground aligned CL Avatar since it needs to be positioned where the shoe last was adjust the Avatar to a height equivalent to the outs sole's height by entering 6 mm on the Y AIS the CL Avatar will be located in the same position as the Sho last ensuring perfect alignment with the sneakers after deleting the Sho last select the entire sneaker pattern and rightclick on the selected pattern in the 3D window then choose convert to Avatar accessory in the accessory registration window set the accessory type to shoes and flats since the sneakers are entirely made from patterns select patterns in the object field making sure no patterns are missing check the mirror creation option to generate the corresponding sneaker for the opposite foot automatically confirm the positioning is correct for both feet if everything is properly aligned and configured click the save button to save your sneakers as a CL accessory file let's create an artwork with the sneakers saved as a CL accessory file since we can apply our shoes on the default CL Avatar we will open up the clothing file we designed using the Mia Avatar the Avatar is currently wearing heels but when we load the saved sneakers zacs 5 it automatically switches to heel down and you will see the sneakers we designed applied to the Avatar with the sneakers on all of Clos pose and motion files are compatible so when we apply a pose file you can check how the pose changes with the sneakers on using the shoe l in this way opens up numerous options for Designing the shoes and enhances the overall completion of the look after following the above process you can create your own shoe files and sell them on connect to generate Revenue let's learn the file size optimization process that must be followed when selling on connect all files should adhere to the appropriate size as guided in the connect manual this ensures that shoes purchased by users can be simulated with other files without being excessively heavy so it's necessary to optimize file size the shoe file selling manual advises keeping the polygon count under 200,000 let let's check if the current file meets this standard to check the total polygon count including top stitches and Graphics first export the entire shoe file as an fvx then repport it into CL and click the everywhere button to view the current polygon count since this file contains only one shoe the polygon count should be below 100,000 however if it significantly exceeds this count you may need to reduce the overall polygon count to adjust the polygon count you can modify the number of meshes adjust the following factors that affect mesh count sequentially and check the polygon count intermittently open the project file of the Garment file state again first change the top Stitch type from obj to texture after changing export it again as fbx and check the total polygon count using the everywhere feature if further reduction is needed delete invisible patterns in the shoes to reduce polygon counts when the Avatar wears the shoes remove any hidden elements like the insole pattern or overlapping designs inside the shoe that aren't visible from the outside if further reduction is necessary increase the particle distance size for parts of the pattern that don't curve significantly or increase the overall particle distance size gradually adjust the particle distance size to ensure the total polygon count Falls below 100,000 once you've successfully optimize the polygon count register the optimized file as a clow accessory following the same method previously used and proceed to list the product on connect this final step makes your optimized shoe design available for purchase by users worldwide the last for making the heel can also be purchased for free free from the connect official account just like the shoe last in the previous video when opening a file you can access it directly from the my item menu in the connect and cl of close's Library window or if you have downloaded it locally you can unzip the file and then drag and drop it into CL the locally downloaded Sho last zip file provides two files the Sho avt file and a project containing both the SHO avt and the insole pattern to use the project file you must unzip the downloaded file and then use the zpj file located inside the folder to efficiently work with the shoe project it's best to use the zpj file that includes the insole pattern we will now open this cprj file by dragging and dropping it into CL once you open the file the 3D window will automatically load both the right and left lasts these LS provide pre-marked 3D pen lines along the center edges and heel guidelines by default this default setup helps streamline the design process making it more convenient in the case of the heel last an insole pattern that connects the upper and the out soole is provided to efficiently reduce the steps in this shoe creation process if you are making heels that are symmetrical on both sides before making heels in Earnest you only need to work on one side of the heels in this tutorial we will Design or create the symmetrical heels utilizing the right heel last and we are going to use the right shoe last so we will delete the left ins sole pattern for Easy View control and use the edit 3D pen Avatar tool in the 3D toolbar for the heel last so we will delete the guid line on the left last and hide it by setting the transparency to zero to make a heel we you will design it by first creating a pattern using the flatten tool and then editing the pattern first press and hold the 3D pen Avatar tool and select the flatten tool after selecting the left and right sides to be created with flatten press enter to create the patterns it is recommended to select all the areas at once and press enter as this automatically sews the seam lines together making the process more efficient to smooth out the generated patterns lower the particle distance value to 3 mm after applying strengthen connect the sewing lines with the insole pattern it is best to check the sewing Direction with the blue picking point that appears after selecting the pattern before proceeding after sewing is completed select the seam lines of the insole pattern and side pattern with the edit sewing tool and then set the fold angle value to 90 so that the seam lines can be simulated ated to perfectly match the angle of the last after the simulation select the side patterns and set the pressure value to minus 70 in the property editor window this will reduce the gap between the last and the side pattern ensuring that the pattern is properly attached to the last while the simulation is running move the pattern and adjust its position to fit the guideline as best as possible after making and sewing a basic stiletto shaped pattern is completed we will add an upper design using Cuts in the inner side pattern as shown in the image first of all to make the Upper Front Center smooth select the edit sewing tool and click on the front center seam and if you delete the 3D seam lines normal map at the bottom of the property editor window by either setting the value to zero or clicking the trash can icon the relevant part will look smooth additionally to cut the design on the inside side side of the heel select the internal polygon SL line tool in the 2D window to create an internal line segment after creating an internal line segment that touches the outline of the pattern select the created line segments with the edit pattern tool rightclick select cut to cut out the pattern and then delete the cut pattern please save your project regularly as you work to prevent the the trouble of losing progress in case of an unexpected crash after the design work is finished we will proceed to apply the pre-made fabric to check if the color of the fabric have been well Incorporated rightclick the Avatar and select hide Avatar to hide it then unstrengthened patterns shoes typically have an outsole and a simple outsole can be created as a pattern in CL for designs that are too complex to create with a pattern please create them as 3D models and add them to clone let's add a simple outsole to this stiletto heel the outsole will utilize the existing insole pattern select the insole pattern and choose layer clone over then you can see that the pattern has been cloned below the existing insole pattern right click the cloned pattern used just created to access remove linked editing and create an internal line segment at the appropriate position where you want to make the heel then rightclick and apply extend slash trim and add point to pattern outline to create points up to the outline do layer clone over again rightclick the newly created pattern and select remove linked editing to disconnect it in the last created clone pattern select the inner line segment created for the heel right click cut and delete the front part of the pattern this pattern with only the heel remaining should be the bottom of the heel so first select all the remaining patterns except for the pattern that will be used for the heel and then freeze them next use the edit sewing tool to delete all the sewing lines in the heel area then run a simulation so that the heel pattern Falls naturally to the ground if it gets stuck due to friction and doesn't come off you can simply use the Gizmo to gently pull it off and continue with the simulation after turning off the simulation of the pattern that fell to the floor press zero on the keyboard to switch to the bottom View and adjust the position by checking whether it falls perpendicular to the back of the shoe now let's create a pillar pattern that will connect the floor and the heel of the heel use the linear measure garment tool in the 3D Toolbar to roughly measure the height from the floor to the back of the heel then select the pattern lying on the floor and check the pattern perimeter in the property editor window create a square pattern based on height and perimeter position the created pattern using the Gizmo as close to the heel as possible so the square pillar pattern starting from the center of the floor pattern after creating a point in the center using the add Point tool likely create a point in the center of the Inner Line of the Clone insole pattern then check the sewing direction using the blue picking point in the 3D window and sew both the top and bottom also sew the left and right sides of the square pattern together lower the particle distance of the pattern to five and run simulation because the length of the square pillar pattern is long the simulation is not fitting perfectly so after selecting the pattern set the shrinkage warp value to 60 in the property editor window then to create an angle on the inner surface create an internal line segment and change the angle value to 90¬∞ after confirming the position with the blue picking point and creating an internal line segment run the simulation if the position is not correct move it according to the edge of the floor pattern and set the blue picking point when the heel sole part is completed press the number zero on the keyboard to switch to the bottom view then select the two bottom patterns in the 3D window right click and flip the side of the fabric using flip normal likewise heel shoe types require a dummy pattern for stable simulation with the Garment essentially because the heel toe part is pointed you could cover it with a dummy pattern however if multiple patterns are layered as part of the design please make sure the entire section is covered with a dummy pattern let's try wrapping the Entre entire heel shoe in a dummy assuming that several design elements are layered first select all completed shoe patterns and then position them from where the Avatar is located to another location in the 2D window then right click in the 3D window deactivate right click again to hide it with hide 3D pattern and then use the flatten function in the 3D Toolbar to pattern the floor panel and when you simulate it it falls to the floor adjust the length of the pattern to make it similar to the front and back length of the heel pose once the bottom part is complete select the side panels starting from the ankle and pattern them at this step freeze the floor pattern also modify the pattern by adding a near the apex of the heel so that the side patterns continue to the floor and cover the heel there is no need to modify the pattern with exact numbers but you you can ensure that it is sufficiently wrapped during simulation once the pattern modification is complete connect the side pattern and bottom pattern with the sewing line then lower the side panel's particle distance to 10 then select the surface circumference measure

        "Summary": "# Comprehensive Guide to Creating Sneakers and Heels Using CL Avatar Shoe Lasts This guide provides a step-by-step process based on the provided transcript for creating sneakers and heels using the newly launched shoe lasts for adult CL Avatar shoe designs. It covers everything from file management to design implementation and optimization for selling on the Connect platform. --- ## **1. Understanding Shoe Lasts** ### **Definitions:** - **Shoe Last:** A mold used to shape shoes. The transcript mentions adult shoe lasts suitable for both male and female adults. - **Toe Types:** Three types are available: round, square, and stiletto. - **Height Types:** Two categories based on shoe height: low (sneakers) and high (boots). - **Insole Pattern:** A template that forms the interior sole of the shoe. ### **Tips:** - Familiarize yourself with the different toe types and height variations to choose the right last for your design. --- ## **2. File Management** ### **Step-by-Step Instructions:** 1. **Accessing the Shoe Last File:** - Navigate to the **My Item Menu** in the Connect and CLO Library window. - If downloaded locally, unzip the file and drag it into CLO. 2. **Contents of the Downloaded File:** - The zip file includes: - `.avt` file (Shoe last file) - A project file containing both the `.avt` and the insole pattern. 3. **Using the Project File:** - Unzip the file. - Use the `.zpj` file in the folder for efficient work with the shoe project. - Open the `.cprj` file by dragging it into CLO. --- ## **3. Setting Up the Design Environment** ### **Instructions:** 1. **Open the 3D Window:** - Upon opening the file, both right and left lasts will load. - Delete the left insole pattern for a cleaner workspace. - Set the transparency of the left shoe last to zero to hide it. 2. **Designing Sneakers:** - Select the **3D Pen Tool** and start drawing design lines on the right shoe last. - Use the left mouse button to create points and draw lines. Hold the control key for curves. - Double-click to finish the line and create a pattern. ### **Tips:** - Ensure that the lines drawn with the 3D pen touch each other without gaps for seamless patterns. --- ## **4. Creating the Shoe Pattern** ### **Instructions:** 1. **Fine-tuning Design Lines:** - Use the **Edit 3D Pen Avatar Tool** to adjust points. - Right-click to add more points if needed. 2. **Flattening the Design:** - Use the **Flatten Feature** to convert design lines into patterns. - Select all areas at once before pressing enter to automatically sew seam lines together. 3. **Organizing Patterns:** - Arrange sewn line segments to face each other in the pattern window. - Lower the particle distance value to 3 mm for smoother patterns. --- ## **5. Adding Details to Sneakers** ### **Instructions:** 1. **Adding Fabric:** - Apply different fabrics to the patterns for varied designs. 2. **Creating the Tongue and Shoelaces:** - Duplicate the upper pattern to create a tongue. - Adjust the layer order to position the tongue beneath the upper. - Import shoelace files as needed. 3. **Creating the Outsole:** - Clone the existing insole pattern for the outsole. - Adjust the height for collision and rendering thickness. ### **Tips:** - Consider adding top stitching for an extra detail to your sneakers. --- ## **6. Finalizing and Saving the Project** ### **Instructions:** 1. **Adjusting the Avatar:** - Clear the workspace and load the CLO female Avatar. - Remove any heels the Avatar is wearing and align it with the 3D grid. 2. **Creating a Dummy Pattern:** - Select and flatten areas except the insole for the dummy mesh. - Adjust the skin offset value (approximately 13 mm) to ensure proper wrapping. 3. **Simulating the Design:** - Apply strengthen to the pattern and run the simulation. ### **Tips:** - Make the dummy pattern invisible by setting its opacity to zero for a cleaner look. --- ## **7. Registering as a CLO Accessory** ### **Instructions:** 1. **Convert to Accessory:** - Open the CLO default Avatar, position it correctly, then delete the shoe last. - Select the entire sneaker pattern and right-click to convert it to an accessory. 2. **Save Accessory File:** - Make sure to check the mirror creation option for automatic generation of the opposite sneaker. --- ## **8. File Size Optimization for Selling** ### **Instructions:** 1. **Check Polygon Count:** - Export the shoe file as an `.fbx` and import it back to check the polygon count. - Ensure it is below 100,000 polygons for optimal performance. 2. **Reducing Polygon Count:** - Change the top stitch type from OBJ to texture. - Remove invisible patterns and increase particle distance size where applicable. 3. **Registering the Optimized File:** - Follow the same method to register the optimized design as a CLO accessory to list on Connect. ### **Tips:** - Regularly check and optimize your files to prevent issues when selling. --- ## **9. Creating Heels** ### **Instructions:** 1. **Open the Heel Last File:** - Access it similarly to the sneaker last. 2. **Designing the Heel:** - Use the flatten tool to create patterns, and ensure sewing lines are correct. - Adjust settings as necessary for fold angles and gaps. 3. **Adding Details and Simulating:** - Add fabric, create outsoles, and simulate to finalize the heel design. ### **Final Steps for Heels:** - Follow the same registration process as for sneakers to ensure they can be sold on Connect. --- By following this comprehensive guide, you can effectively create, finalize, and sell your own sneaker and heel designs using the CL Avatar shoe lasts. Happy designing!"
