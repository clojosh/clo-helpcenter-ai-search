        "Transcript": "my name is Priti and I'm going to be walking you through the new features of close 7.2 we're really excited about the new features and we're hoping that this will enhance your workflow if you are watching this video please use the live chat below to ask any questions that you may have during the video if you are watching this video a little later please use the comment section below to ask any questions and we will get back to you so let's dive right into it so this is one of the most awaited features that we have added in 7.2 which is the soft body simulation it is super simple to use all you have to do is select the avatar and in the property editor there's going to be a soft body simulation checkbox you can turn that on and then below it there is a soft body stiffness slider which you can use to adjust how strong her muscles are going to be so once you adjust the stiffness you can then simulate it you will notice the changes immediately you will be able to identify if your avatar has soft body turned on by the indicator at the bottom left corner of the 3D window now let's get into the details of the stiffness slider for example if this person is super fit and they go to the gym regularly then they are probably at the higher end of the soft body stiffness slider which is closer to ten thousand this means they've got a lot of muscle definition and there's not a lot to move around on the contrary if this person is comparatively less fit then they will be at the lower end of the scale   simulation is compatible with all Clow default avatars which includes all men's and women avatars this also means that you can use the Avatar Editor to adjust the default avatars to the sizes you need however please ensure that you do not turn on soft body before adjusting the measurements of the Avatar adjust the measurements of the Avatar first and then turn on your soft body using this process will make your workflow more efficient please note if the Soft body is on you will not be able to use the Avatar editor you can also use all of our ASTM sizing for changing the Avatar body size from 7.2 you can now Express elastic more realistically in the library under the fabric folder you can find the elastic folder you have two types of elastic presets available the woven and the knit one now use the feature from the last release you can add another folder and rename it and then you can bring in the elastic to organize it in separate folders you can easily drag and drop it onto your pattern as well and now let's zoom in to look at the structure of the elastic now let's add the elastic to our object browser and add it to our waistband Additionally you can customize the elastic by changing the color add in normal maps and textures to match the required aesthetic next let's see the elastic using the fit Maps when I change my elastic properties strength you'll notice how the fit Maps adjust to the changes made the pressure is higher when the strength is increased and vice versa let's apply elastic to the straps the important thing to note here while applying elastic is to ensure that the grain line is perpendicular to your pattern because that's how elastic naturally is and we want to keep things accurate once the green line is adjusted you are good to go ahead I'm quickly going to make some aesthetic changes to my elastic by adding color there is another way you can apply elastic by using The Binding tool so here you can apply binding to the edge of the swimsuit as you have been doing previously after applying The Binding in the property editor you can change the fabric to one of the elastic options added in the object browser make sure you also change the green line to weft and when you simulate you can see the changes we'll bring in another garment to show you a few other ways you can add elastic and adjust it now if I simulate this it will start to fall because I do not have any elastic added to the Garment let's take measurement to make a pattern for an internal elastic waistband so here I'm creating my pattern making sure that the gray and lines of perpendicular this is very important I'm going to arrange and silver the elastic to the waistband pattern very quickly   is staying on the Avatar I can begin to apply my elastic presets which you will find in the same elastic folder you can then just drag and drop it onto the object browser and then drag and drop it onto the pattern here I am using the woven elastic and now I have an internal elastic and you can notice how the gathers are more realistic and how it looks much better now when compared to the internal lines we used to use before now to make this elastic truly realistic let's go ahead and convert this into a concealed elastic waistband this will enhance the look of the elastic giving it a more realistic appeal so I'm just going to select my base pattern and layer clone it under it's always a good practice to use your set sub layers tool here I'm using the set sub layers to ensure the placement of my waistband let's simulate it and wait for it to settle down as you can see it gives it a more realistic look previously we had used The Binding tool to add elastic similarly we can use the binding tool to add elastic at the Hem and also change the width of the elastic after adding The Binding you can follow the same process of changing the material in the property editor you can change the width from here to either make it bigger or smaller and you can also change the length of the elastic so first let's simulate and then check the measurement of the Avatar and edit the length of the elastic accordingly we can now change the color of the elastic and you can see how realistic the elastic appears let's see the final way in which you can add elastic by adding it onto the Hem of Our Sleeve I'm going to create another pattern for the elastic copy the top Fabric in the object browser and then assign it to the created pattern when the property editor under physical properties you now have the option to change it from fabric to elastic and then you can change the property of the elastic to match either woven or knit this way you have the same texture as the original fabric this concludes all the variations you can apply elastics in a more realistic way to your garments we are excited for you to try it out and give us feedback we have updated our modular mode to make it more user friendly and easier to use we hope this makes your workflow much smoother and efficient in this version we have created a new modular library with more presets and options which includes men's women's and kids let's dive into making our own blocks within our new modular workflow first let's go to file and save it as a style now with the help of this modular Creator pop-up box you can bring in your own folder by clicking on the plus icon and then you can go into your category to bring in a new category as well for those of you who are familiar with closet this is organized very similar to that now you can easily save all your blocks in a similar way it is very open-ended you can organize it according to your preferences here I'm going to add a new category and name it I'm going to double click on the category which will take me straight to style so I'm going to add in a new style and as you can see a pop-up window appears and you'll be able to see the thumbnail of the style after which you'll just have to create a name Additionally you can also change the thumbnail once I've created my style and named it now we can begin to create our blocks by double clicking on the style you have the option to create new block types open up block presets and save or add them here we can add in all our new blocks you can also change the block name under the tag option and you can customize it according to your need this is very flexible for everyone and for different naming conventions even after adding the blocks if you wish to remove any of them you can just click delete need to ensure every block has a pattern assigned to it otherwise I cannot click on OK use the transform pattern tool let's select all the patterns that correspond with the front body now what's interesting is that the name is automatically generated for you for the thumbnail again you have the option to change it or use what is auto generated on clone the naming convention makes it easy to organize it follows the style name and the block tag name once we add it in and assigned all your patterns to blocks you will then be able to click on OK you will immediately get a dialog box you can check your taglines before finalizing your blocks if you need to make changes to your tax you can go back and make the edits as required also if you're selling tags are incorrect that means your sewing is incorrect which you will have to redo to fix if there are minor Corrections you can drag some of the sewing tags and instantly Rectify them however if it's completely wrong please click on cancel and go all the way back once you're all set you can click on OK it will cumulate within the new library located here to the left you have created an entire new library now this is where it gets exciting you can create multiple variations instantaneously using the style line tool you can drag and resize to make changes to the Garment that's how easy it is to create alterations using this tool now just by clicking on the plus icon in the blog section in the modular Library I'll be able to add and bring in these new variations of our garment that we just created you can make alterations to any of the blocks to create multiple variations and now see that this keeps getting added to your existing library and this way you can form new collections this will help your designers and pattern makers create different silhouettes by mixing and matching various blocks it doesn't end here to show you the other features that we have included I am going to open up a similar garment and save it within the modular Library so that I have more options and variations to work with let's follow the same process as we did previously click on the plus icon of the front body and save it click on the corresponding pattern to the respective block let's quickly do this to create more options to play with this feature is very versatile and accommodates various styles to experiment with like before on clicking OK you will see this dialog box asking you to verify the sowing relationships of tag lines so ensure it is correct and now we can just walk through the library and see all of these different options and variations and make a whole new garment just by clicking on various blocks thank you you have included second animations and movement in 7.2 this is a very exciting feature this new update will allow you to make captivating and dynamic animations in clue so now when you open up the animation mode you will be able to see three new buttons the first button will allow you to create keyframes the second button will facilitate you to see the preview window and the third one will allow you to see the camera path let's begin with first button please ensure that the Garment and the motion files are recorded together before you start to make any adjustments we can start off by using the slider to adjust and find the perfect angle that you want to start the animation with then we can use the first button which is the add keyframe button and that will be the first camera shot similarly I can move the slider and find my second shot and again click on the add keyframe button after which you will be able to see the preview window which is the second button this will allow me to see the preview window of my camera angle this is really exciting now you can follow the same process of sliding and setting the frames Additionally you can edit and adjust the keyframes as well by clicking and holding down the frame now let's see how the third button Works which is the camera path when it's zoomed in it will not be visible so we have to zoom out once start to zoom out you'll see the camera right away now you can select the camera and move it around with the help of the Gizmo this is really helpful to perfect or adjust your camera angles after you have decided it you can also notice as I move the slider the camera follows the blue line which defines the camera path you have the ability to change the camera path as well there are two options to switch to one is the continuous path and the other is the straight track this is good for when you want your camera to move in a straight line that is what I did for this last keyframe now to meet the next keyframe ensuring that the camera path is on I am going to use my Gizmo tool to move my camera to a different angle in order to follow this process always make sure that you are checking the preview window as it will show you exactly what the camera is viewing here as it is not focused on the Avatar I am going to adjust the angle Into the Blue Dot and place it where I want it to be focused the blue dot is an indicator of where the focus of the camera lies again I could start to move the camera around to zoom into the Garment you will visually be able to see the blue line that is constantly moving as this defines the movement of the camera from the initial to the final position you can continue to follow the same process to direct your camera into different angles you also have the option to save all the camera angles that you have created we also have included presets to make the workflow more user-friendly and efficient you can go to the Avatar folder and you will be able to access the camera motion files this will allow you to access various presets that you can use so the presets have certain camera motions that you can choose to use anywhere in the animation once you add it in you will be able to start moving the slider to see exactly how it will look within your recording so I have saved my new camera preset and to bring it in all I have to do is go to file open camera motion and get the same camera preset motion file to save your camera motion again go to file click on save as camera motion now you can go ahead and record this through various options like video capture or rendering we have made some improvements to our Avatar default Library we have updated our Avatar folder with all the new default avatars for women we have added three new women avatars which look more realistic which you can also find within our connect Library likewise we have also added three new men avatars now in 7.2 we have made it easier to edit and adjust your avatars you will notice that you can check and uncheck these three measurements in your avatar editor once you uncheck a measurement it indicates that it will automatically adjust based on the proportions to the other measurements this is helpful when you are unsure of a certain measurement or if you don't know them all you can just easily uncheck some so that you can just input the measurements that you know another interesting update that we've added in is the proportions option when I check this on you see that it uses either the proportion option of inseam or the center Front to waist to ensure that the Avatar is adjusted with those proportions in mind this gives you more proportionate and natural Avatar body this will allow Khloe to automatically proportion certain measurements out based on the key measurements that you have inputted another Avatar update that we've made is the update with joints let's start by bringing in one of the avatars now select and turn on x-ray which will allow you to see the joints here select one of the joints and when symmetry is turned on you will see that the arrow stays there as well this indicates any changes made to one side for example when I move the joint forward or back or rotate it it will automatically get reflected on the other side as well now we also have the option to move the joints forward or backwards this will be helpful to improve postures now our avatars are updated with fbx previously when you imported an avatar as an fbx you were unable to move the mesh around now when you import the Avatar as an fbx you will be able to move the mesh around and it will not be bound by any specific object so here if I bring in another fbx you'll be able to see that this can be moved around as well moreover I can also have the Garment distinct from the Avatar and move the Garment around as well one um one of our final Avatar updates includes eye control now which is really exciting let's zoom in a bit and select the eye now in the property editor under eye control you will be able to move the slider and this will result in moving the position of the eye you can move it to left or right or use the other slider to move it up or down making the side eye possible we have made improvements to optimize the curve tool here you can see my 2D window so when I right click I have the option to select optimize all curve points before we select this option I would like to show you how these patterns look with all the curve points let's begin by selecting the curve Point tool located in the 2D toolbar once you select the tool you will be able to see all the curve points as you can see there are many curve points now let's switch back to the transform pattern tool right click in the 2D window and select the option optimize all curve points this option will allow code to analyze every pattern in the 2D window and optimize it together once you select the optimize all curve points option claw will automatically generate the least number of curve points you can then choose to move the slider and adjust the percentage according to your requirement you can choose to increase or decrease the curve points and you will also be able to see the preview of the adjustments simultaneously in the 2D window I'm going to undo the previous step so I can show you the same option on an individual pattern to do so all you need to do is select the pattern right click and click on the option optimize curve points this will allow you to adjust the curve points for a specific pattern and its symmetric copy alternatively you also have the option to adjust the curve points on a specific line or segment if you wish to adjust the curve points only on the neck opening all you're required to do is select the segment using the edit pattern tool right click and choose the option optimize curve points here I am just optimizing the curve points for a selected segment this option allows you to control the number of curve points for each segment making the process more efficient furthermore you can also identify the least number of curve points required to optimize the process thank you we've made improvements to the reference line ability let's begin by selecting the pattern right click and select the Clone as reference line option this will create a reference line of the original pattern when you begin to edit this pattern you will always have a reference of the original pattern here let's put some Precision edits and as you can see there is a gray line that indicates the pattern's origin additionally we have also made improvements to our Trace tool so now you can select the reference line using the trace tool this was not possible before however now it is this allows me to go back to the original pattern easily all I am required to do is select the trace line and the edited pattern outline using the trace tool right click and choose the option to replace this pattern outline just like the previous step I have a reference line of the edited pattern so if I wish to go back I can very easily select the reference line right click and replace the pattern outline this method allows me to keep going back and forth effortlessly another amazing feature that we have Incorporated is if you create an internal line and cut and sew the pattern the reference line will follow both the pattern pieces this will allow you to keep track of the reference line on all the patterns without having to repeat the process we have included another tracing update that will allow you to trace the half symmetry line now you can trace the half symmetry line without having to worry about the internal line in the center okay we have also included some exciting updates to the unfold options in 7.2 it may be a small change but we are hoping it creates a huge impact you will now be able to select multiple lines right click and use the unfold option on all of them together after selecting the lines you can select the unfold or unfold pattern outline or unfold symmetric editing we have made additional improvements to the unfold option here I want to unfold this pattern with symmetric editing this will also copy all the internal lines to the symmetric pattern if you wish to unfold without the internal lines we have included an option to unfold pattern outline only this will allow you to unfold just a pattern outline without the internal line however note that this is not symmetric this indicates any changes made to one side will not reflect on the other side one slight change that we have made in our 2D window is that now the pattern names are parallel to the green lines from the feedback received from our users we have made this change as it makes it a lot easier for identification especially especially when exporting dxf patterns even when the green line is changed the name of the pattern will also change to be parallel to it previous versions when we switch to different sizes The Notches would automatically move to match up to the measurement however we have learned that not all our users require this now we've created an option of fixed or ratio you also have the option to change this both within your file or when you're importing a dxf here when I import a dxf I have my Notch position under which I can either select fixed or ratio let's select fixed and click on OK   now when I switch between sizes you'll notice that The Notches are fixed based on where this should be you will have better visibility of this when they are all lined up at the bottom and The Notches do not move it stays in its fixed positions you also have the option to adjust the notches using the notch tool located in the 2D toolbar then in the property editor you can check or uncheck fixed under the graded size option now keeping the fixed check I can again adjust my measurements and switch between migrated sizes we have made some exciting improvements to greeting now in version 7.2 you can copy and paste the grading rule value of X and Y individually so here with the edit grading tool you can copy the X and Y values and then right click on the point where you want to paste the graded values the new update here is that you have the option to paste just X or paste just y or of course you can do both and there are shortcuts to increase the speed of your workflow we've also made mirror pasting a possibility in this version you can just paste the X and Y values this will allow you to copy paste your graded values from one point to multiple points quickly this should help optimize your grading process another visual update we've made to grading is now when you select a point using your grading tools you'll automatically will be able to see the X and Y values there are two new exciting features added to the print layout mode Let's quickly change to the print layout mode one of the updates we've made is being able to customize the marker length for your fabric role in the property editor let's begin by changing the number of graded garments we wish to Nest I am setting two for small one for medium and so on here you can also set the units and change the length of the marker so now when I switch on Nest patterns the algorithm will create the overlaps and it will also create multiple markers if need be to accommodate all the patterns the second marker will then appear on the right side of the first marker this also gives you the flexibility to move the patterns around you can also see the marker length as well as the consumption at the top of the marker another really great update we've made is that you can now see the graded sizes within the editor now that we have all the graded sizes for bed identification you can switch on the coloring located in the toggle menu of the 2D window this will assign a color to each size you can also turn on the size names of the graded patterns this gives you better visibility to identify various patterns easily we've made some exciting improvements to our colorway editor one of the updates includes improvements in the top stitches here when you select the top Stitch you see it selects in the 3D window this is quite resourceful if you have multiple top stitches and need to identify the top Stitch selected in the colorway editor note that here the top Stitch needs to be a texture if it's an obj this feature will not work we have added the same Improvement for our graphics on selecting the graphic it will get highlighted in the 3D window this will help you identify where the graphics are placed and make changes to the right graphics in the 7.2 version we have also included an update in which if a fabric is selected in the colorway editor it will automatically get selected in the object browser similarly when you select a trim in the colorway editor the corresponding trim will get highlighted in the 3D window the updates will allow you to identify the placements of all the elements selected in the colorway editor we have made a few updates with respect to materials as well let's check it out you can go to materials click on substance as you can see the icon has changed and when I bring this into my object browser the icon has been changed there as well the same change can also be noticed in the property editor another Improvement we made is to our Graphics in this version we have improved the graphics over seam lines which is helpful while working with patch Pockets or any other pockets here you need to ensure you set sub layer correctly all you have to do first is make sure you create your subset layers first let's bring in a graphic and place it on top of the pattern if you wish to see the graphic over the pocket you can select the graphic and then in the property editor turn on the over seam line option as I stated before we need to ensure that our sub layers are set correctly here I'm going to select my set sub layer tool and select my pocket and position it over my shirt and you will immediately be able to see the graphic over the pocket most of you have requested for this feature and now it is possible in 7.2 again ensure that you position the patterns correctly using the set sub layer tool likewise this will also work on side seams here again let's check the overseam line option it will automatically work for the other side although to continue it over the pockets you have to set sub-layer and position the pocket over the trouser pattern a new update we have made in materials is to our zippers as it is a frequently used tool previously you were able to edit the components of the zipper separately with our latest update you can now save these changes as well so here I'm going to edit each component differently by changing the color the size and material type once you've achieved the desired aesthetic you can select the zipper and click on Save located in the property editor let's give it a name and click on the folder you wish to save the file in now you can choose each component that you wish to save you can check and uncheck them accordingly this is how you will be able to save them together or separately we'll go ahead and save this as a group and click on OK this feature also allows you to bring all the components together into a new style that you are working on and of course all of these changes will get reflected in the bom editor as well so now on opening the bom editor you will be able to see each component of the zipper separately initially you had a limitation to how short the fur could be for rendering now in the latest 7.2 update we have taken away that limitation so this makes it convenient for you to make various flock prints and home good Fabrics as there are there's no limitation to the minimum for length so here in the property editor you can go as low as 0.01 and will still work within the render window which is a great Improvement to make products look more realistic you can play around with the fur length and adjust it according to the required aesthetic here you can compare the product in the minimum fur lens in the previous version and the new version it's team 7.2 we have updated the scenes and props to allow you to import them all together with the render properties and save them all together as well let's go ahead and create a scene first I'm going to bring in a background ensure I load it as a scene and props and then I'm going to add a few more here you have the option to check your scenes and prop section to identify where they are once you have the scene set up you can select either one of these props and adjust the placement according to your preference now let's go into the render window and set the lighting according to our environment you can set the lighting as per your aesthetic as you know in our previous version we've updated our presets with Studio light setting options to choose from now all we have to do is go to file save as scene and props and this will save the scene and all the props including the render settings as one file this gives you the flexibility to prep the scene according to the Garment and also create variations of scenes easily this will help designers create their own environment library and recycle through them now here I have my garment let's go ahead and bring in the background that we had just created to do so go to file add scene and props and select the file that we had previously saved ensure that you check this scene as well as the render properties in the pop-up box and then click on OK and as you can see we have imported the scene which includes the props as well now you can change the position of each of these components as they remain separate entities for example you can make adjustment to the placement of the plant you can also change the textures of these components individually let's jump into the render window to see how this looks again you can change the lighting according to the scene you wish to create we've made an interesting update to our rendering by providing more options for color mapping if you go to the render settings now you have the color mapping option so in our settings for render you can see over here in color mapping let's explore the first type after switching on the interactive render window you can control the burn value this will help you correct any overexposure that may happen especially in light colored Fabrics placed against a light background here let's decrease the burn value from 1 to 0.5 and switch on the interactive render window so here I'm going to decrease the burn value from 1 to 0.5 and as you can see it looks much better there are a few great options to enhance your images and make them look better here are some examples for you we have made some exciting UI improvements as well we have made an update to downloading initially when you downloaded Fabrics after seeing the end symbol you are only able to download them in the icon view now with the new improvements you can also download specific Fabrics in the list view if you scroll to the bottom of the list you will be able to download specific Fabrics by checking the ones you decided to download which makes it much easier   we've made is to our object browser with respect to dragging and dropping so when you drag and drop a fabric or a trim you now have options in the user settings you can control how the dropped item replaces the original here you have two options to choose from you can either choose the option where the drop items name replaces the existing one or select the option where the original retains its name so here when I drag and drop this keeping the option that the new fabric is always replacing the old fabric with respect to the name you can see it works perfectly you can try the other option as well it works just as well if you try the other option you will notice that the original name will always stay and the only the fabric properties are assigned to the respective patterns   we have improved the title menu to enable our users to understand it better we have adopted a boulder and another great font so it doesn't look like a deactivated option another quick and easy update we've made is with respect to the color palette so now when you open up the color palette window you'll be able to see the options reflect similar to other options we have in clue so now you have the option to apply and close or just close another awaited UI update we have included is with respect to the press tool now with the press tool you will be able to see a little inscription text that explains what you should do with the tool and that you can select different sites to press if you wish thank you so much for watching this video we really hope you enjoyed it and learned a lot if you have any questions please use the comment section below to ask your questions and one of the Khloe 3D designers will get back to you on it really hope you enjoy using 7.2 and don't forget to like And subscribe thank you again for watching ",

        "Transcript": "  Phoebe and I'm going to walk you through the new features of clothes 7.2 we're really excited to show you all of this and we hope you have as much fun using these features as we did making them if you have any questions while watching this please use the live chat if you're watching this a little later you can use the comment section below and let's have some fun while we learn so in 7.2 we've done something amazing we've given you all soft body we're so excited about it we can't wait for you all to use it it is super simple to do all you have to do is select the Avatar like so and then over in your property editor there's going to be a soft body simulation checkbox you can then turn that on and then down below there's going to be a like stiffness slider which you can use to adjust how like strong her like muscles her his or theirs muscles are uh and everything and then you can simulate and as you saw it changed you'll always know if your avatar has soft body turned on by the indicator at the lower left hand that will always tell you if the Avatar has soft body now let's talk a little bit about this stiffness slider this is how I think about it okay if this person is super fit and they go to the gym like all the time then they are probably at the higher end so closer to ten thousand that means they've got a lot of muscle definition and there's not a lot to actually move around now if this person is more of the couch fan and maybe indulging on bunner and exciting snacks and often then maybe they are at the lower end of the scale now this soft body is compatible with all clue default avatars so all men and women avatars you can use this with exciting right that also means though that you can of course use the Avatar Editor to adjust our default avatars to the sizes you need however please do not turn on soft body and then start to adjust the measurements of the Avatar adjust the measurements of the Avatar first and then turn on your soft body it'll just make your life so much better and we've actually made it so you can't do it if soft body is on the Avatar editor will not be going on you can also use all of our ASTM sizing for changing of the body Avatar size and everything but again men and women works great we're so excited for this and we hope you love it all right so let's talk about elastic we've updated elastic in 7.2 to actually have presets for you so over here in fabric I can go to elastic folder and I can now bring in these elastic folders Now using that great feature we created for you in the last release I think you can now have like another folder and call it trims and then you can bring in that elastic so that it's separated out and organized and you can just easily drag and drop it onto your pattern or you can hit a sign or anything like that because elastic works a lot like Fabrics right now so with this little bathing suit what I can do is again I can adjust the aesthetic of this elastic to match what I want it to be using colors normal Maps textures anything like that what I'm going to also show you here is with the bitmaps I can change around my elastic properties strength and you'll see how Here in My Fit Maps it adjusts to it and everything really cool right when it's stronger it has more pressure when it's less strong less pressure you know makes sense so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to apply some elastic to my straps one important thing to know when applying elastic make sure your gray line is perpendicular to your pattern and everything because that's how elastic naturally is and we want to keep things accurate so this is perfect how my pattern is all set up in the green line so I'm all set and good to go again I'm just going to edit my elastic a little bit and everything like that cool there is though another way to apply elastic and that's actually with our binding tool Buddha thunk it so here I can just apply my binding to like the edges of my swimsuit and here I can adjust this so that instead of a fabric it's actually one of my elastic options because you can do the drop down just make sure that the grain line is that it's weft not bias and as you can see when now I simulate it works really well so cool I'm going to bring in another garment and show you a few other ways in which you can add an elastic and adjust it so here I have another garment arranged in zone and everything if I stimulate though it will start to fall because I do not have any elastic on her what I'm going to do first is take some measurements and then I'm going to make a pattern for an internal elastic band for my waistband so here I'm creating my pattern and editing all of that make sure that the grain lines are perpendicular really important all right now I can just arrange and sew and place this on really quickly and easily using all of those great features that we've had into the software for so long that I know you all love now that this is actually staying on her I can start to apply my my elastic preset which again is in my Fabric and then there's a folder elastic and I can just drag and drop it over and again I'm organized which is great and I'm using my woven and just dragging and dropping that on and now I have an internal elastic and what you can also see is how the gathers are already there and how much more realistic it looks than when we just had our internal lines like before now to make this truly realistic I'm actually going to make another waistband pattern so that the elastic is actually inside of both which is going to be so cool for you to see because you're like well I can make like a truly truly realistic garment so much easier now amazing so here I'm just going to select my waistband say layer clone under and place that under now another good trick though is always using your set subset layers tool so here I'm using my set subset layers and I'm making sure everyone knows where they should sit looks so great right now as I showed you before you can use binding for your elastic now and what's also great is you can always change the width of it so for this hem I can actually put in a binding but you actually put it in as elastic I can change the width around to be bigger and everything I also though need to change the length of my binding but first i'm going to simulate and then check the measurement of the avatar and then this is all looking really great and the final way in which you can also do elastic which is also really cool is here I have my sleeve and I'm going to make another pattern for a kind of like elastic little sleeve Edge go to my Fabric and copy the fabric and then apply it to that new pattern piece that I just created because what I can then do is in the property editor I can actually change that to elastic and then I can select it what type of property of the elastic it is if it's woven or knit or anything or custom and apply it like that that way I have the same textures as I wanted to from the original fabric but instead the fabric properties are a elastic so super cool we have so many different variations in which you can now apply elastic and make it look even more realistic than ever before we hope you really like this we're really excited for all of you to try this out and like give us all the feedback so yeah we have updated our modular to the Revolutionary and like so much easier and better to use that I hope it is life-changing and just life amazing for all of you and you all use this all the time what we've done is we've made our new modular library off to the side with more presets and more options you'll have men women and kids and I'm gonna now walk you through how you can actually make your own blocks super easy within our new modular workflow so first you're going to go to file save as Style and then this modular Creator pop-up box is going to show up you can then bring in your own group which you'll bring in a folder and you hit add and it'll take it from your computer or anything and then you can bring that in and then you can go into your categories and then bring in a new category as well so for any of you who know closed set which is really great and you should all know it because it's a great like partner of Khloe and everything this is actually organized very similarly to that so you can easily save all of your blocks in a similar way it's very open-ended so you can really organize this however you want it to be organized name anything however you want so here I'm going to make a new category hit OK and I'm going to double click and that will take me straight to style now I'm going to add in a new style and as you'll see a pop-up window will come up and a image will already be there for you and you'll just have to create a name you can though bring in your own thumbnail if you'd like I'm going to I'm going to bring that in from my own computer now once I've created my style and named it I'm going to now go to my blocks by just double clicking on my style and here I have create new block types just so you know you can open up block presets save out all of your block presets or add in a new block or add an in and I'm going to add in all of my new blocks I need a front back and all of that what is good to know though is you can change your block name underneath there's like tag and you can change that to whatever you need it to say again very flexible for anyone and any naming conventions you have if you by mistake added in an extra block that you don't need you can just hit delete now what I'll do is I need to make sure every block has a pattern assigned to it otherwise I cannot hit OK so using my transform pattern tool I'm going to select all the patterns that coincide with front body well it's super cool and like game changing is the fact that the name is already created for you and also the thumbnail again you can bring in your own thumbnail if you want or you can just use what club provides all up to you and as you can say the naming convention is really cool I mean I didn't really pick anything that creative but it's fun and it follows the style name and the uh block tag name now once you've added in and assigned all of your patterns to blocks you'll then be able to hit OK what will then happen is you'll be able to check your sewing tags side note if your sewing tags are incorrect that means your sewing is incorrect so you should redo your sewing to fix all of that okay uh but you can like drag some of the sewing tags if something's like a little bit off you can do that but if it's very wrong please hit cancel and go all the way back once you're all set you can then hit OK and it will populate within the new library invigorator over here to the left and look at that you have a whole library now okay this is where I think like magic happens now let's say you want to create a lot of variations really quickly well I don't know if you know this but we have this great tool called style line and you can just quickly drag and resize and move things around and before you've got know it you've got a whole new scar look at that now what I can do is just hit Plus on my blocks in my modular library and bring in these new skirts that I just created voila variations and you can continue to do that as much as you want and before you know it you're going to have a whole new library of different options for your 2D designers to use your designers to use anyone to use and you're gonna just be so happy just like I was when I created this feature for you all so yay what's also cool okay because we're not done yet it's a multi-cool feature is now what I'm going to do is I'm going to open up another garment that is similar to this and I'm going to save it within this modular Library as well so that I have even more options and variations and all I have to do is hit Plus for this front body because I already know which style I want it saved under and everything and I'm again just going to assign all the patterns to go with the blocks that they should be defined by and just do this really quickly I'll have a whole nother options for me myself and I when I say this might be the coolest and my favorite feature right now it's because I mean look at this it's so cool now I hit okay check those sewing lines I did a great job I know how to sew congrats me and look at this populated they're amazing and now I can just click through this library and see all of these different options and variations and make a whole new garment I just like frankensteining a bunch of different options together so we have updated our animation to include camera animation and movement so we're really excited about this we think it's going to allow you to make truly captivating and dynamic animations all within clothes so let's get started when you open up animation mode you're going to see three new buttons uno dos tres one two three three the first one will allow you to create new keyframes the second one will allow you to see preview window and the third one will allow you to see your camera path now let's start with number one before you do anything please make sure you have recorded your garment and motion file together and then start to add in the camera motions and everything so here I'm going to use my slider to adjust and find that perfect angle that I want to start this with once I've found that I'll then use my first button which is ADD keyframe and that will bring in my first sight camera shop cool right then I can slide again and find my second one and again click that keyframe then if I want I can start to see my preview window so that's the second button so now I can select second button and see the preview window for my camera angle which is really cool now again I can start to slide and zoom in and maybe add in another keyframe right cool now another thing you can do here which is pretty nifty is you can start to edit and adjust the keyframes too so I can click and hold down and slide and everything which is really nice now I'm going to use button number three which is the C camera path when I have this when I'm this zoomed in I'm not gonna see it so I'm gonna have to zoom out a bit once I start to zoom out you'll see the camera right away like so and now you will actually be able to select that camera and use the Gizmo tool to move it around if you want right like look at that this is really great for after you've like made your angles and you want to perfect it or adjust it or anything like that what you're also seeing is when I'm moving the slider you see that camera following the blue line that is the camera path that it's following around another thing you can do is you can change that path so you have like a continuous option or you can also do straight so if you want it to be like a straight line you can also have that so that the camera always moves in a straight line so forward and back that's what I did for this last key frame now with this camera path on and everything I'm going to continue to use that to make my next keyframe so what I'm going to do here is I'm actually going to use my Gizmo tool to move my camera to another angle what's also really important though when you're doing it like this is to always really use that preview window because that is going to tell you exactly what the camera is seeing so because I can see that it's no longer focused on the Avatar what I'm going to do is zoom into that little tiny blue dot and place it where I want it to be focused that is where you want that is like where the camera is going to put its attention at so I'm on it on the my avatar and garment because I worked really hard on that and it is the star of this show okay and now again I can start to move my app my camera around to maybe Zoom really close in or anything like that you see the blue line is constantly moving based off of how that camera is going to move to get to that position all right pretty cool right now I can continue to make more and more if I want but or you might also be wondering is hey Phoebe like help a friend out don't you have any presets of course we do so we made some presets for you all but also you can save all of your camera angles as well if you want to but in Avatar you can see that there is a camera motion font folder and you can bring in those presets if you'd like the presets match with certain motions that we like did these cameras to but you can use it anywhere and once you load it you can then start moving that slider to see exactly how it will look within your recording pretty cool so I actually saved my new camera preset and everything so all I have to do now is actually go to file open camera motion and then I'll be able to bring in the one that I saved and you can save them by going to file save as camera motion and now I have this here and all you have to do now is just record this through like the video capture if you want or you can render this out and it'll all be amazing and you'll be like look how cool I am   we've made some updates to avatars first we've given you all new default avatars so for women we have three new women avatars that are much more realistic and that are within our connect library and we've also given you three new men avatars here they are now another update we've made to avatars is within our Avatar editor we've made it a little bit easier for you to edit and adjust the Avatar within the Avatar editor always trying to make your day better I'll see over here on the right that I can check and uncheck these three measurements if I uncheck a measurement that means that it will automatically adjust based off of the proportions and everything to the other measurements that I imported uh inputted in that means that if you're unsure of a certain measurement or if you don't know them all you can just easily uncheck some so that you can just input the measurements that you know another update we've made is at the very top here we now have a proportions option what will happen here is if I check this on it will then use the either proportion option of inseam or center Front to waist to adjust the avatar with those proportions in mind it will at the end of the day give you a much more proportioned in natural bodied Avatar when adjusting the measurements it will allow code to just automatically proportion certain measurements out based off of your those that key measurement that you input inputted in   we've made to our avatars is the update with joints so here I'm going to bring in one of my avatars and I can now select and turn on x-ray and here I can select my joint and when I turn on symmetry you'll now actually see that my arrows stay there as well so that means when I move the joint forward or back or anything or rotate it oh whatever happens to one side will happen to the other as always when you turn on symmetry but now you have the option two of like moving it forward or back or anything like that we hope this will really help with postures and everything so enjoy so we've updated our avatars with fbx so before when you imported it you were unable to move around the meshes when you imported it as an fbx but now importing with fbx as you can see you can now move around those meshes and everything quite easily and they will not be bound to any specific object so here if I bring in another fbx you'll see that this can be moved around and everything and I can also have the dress separate from the Avatar and just move the dress around and one of our final updates with our Avatar is eye control now which is really cool so here I'm going to zoom in a bit so here I have my avatar and now what I can do is I can select the eye and in my property editor I'm able to use my slider and actually move the position of the eye left to right or I can use the other slider to do up and down making the side eye possible now in 7.2 we have improved our optimized curve Point tool so here I have a pattern and if I right click I can say optimize all curve points before I do though I quickly want to show you what this pattern looks like with all of my curve points so I'm going to go to my curve Point tool over on my 2D tool bar and as you can see I have a lot of red dots Maybe too many red dots so now what I can do is I can go back to my transform pattern tool and I can either just right click and optimize all curve points what that will do is that we'll use every pattern within my 2D space and we'll try to optimize it all together it will automatically come in with the least curve Point option you can then start to adjust this with the percentage with the slider bar if you want so if you want more or less you can definitely do that and you'll see a preview of what it will look like while you're adjusting it as you saw you I'm gonna hit undo and now what I'm going to do is just to show you what it would look like if I just selected one pattern so you can also just select one pattern right click and say optimize curve points and then that will just adjust that one pattern and of course it's symmetric copy and you can just adjust that one you also have the ability to just adjust the line or the segment so let's say I just wanted to adjust that neck opening with way too many curve points here I can go to my edit pattern tool select the segment right click optimize curve points and here I will just adjust that line and optimize the curve points there each time you pick a smaller section or pattern or anything you'll get more exact option of how little curve points you need in so we have updated our reference line ability here in 7.2 along with our tracing so first I'm going to select this pattern right click and say clone as reference line what this will do is it will make a reference line of what this pattern is originally so when I start to edit this pattern I'll always see what it started as so I'm going to make some like Precision edits and everything and as you can see there's that Gray Line that's showing me what it was originally clonaz reference line is great what's great here though is now I'm able to actually trace this clone as reference line so before you couldn't but now you can and what's great about that is now I can just quickly and easily go back so I can select my Trace line and everything and right click and say replace this pattern outline simple easy and now I again have a reference line here to show me what it was before and I can again do the same thing right click replace as uh pattern outline and keep going back and forth it's really great because it allows you to quickly jump back to what your original was if you need to what we've also done is we've made it so if you cut your pattern which I'm going to do here so I'm going to create an internal line really quickly and now I'm just going to cut and sew and the reference line will follow with the new cut pattern so the reference line will always be with you anywhere you go which is really nice and another update we've done with some tracing you know we're bouncing back and forth is we can now Trace that Center half symmetry line so with that half symmetry line I can just trace it as usual so all of that stress of the internal lines in the center is no longer with you it's going to be great we've also updated our unfolding option so this is really great because it's a little change but it's going to really pack a punch for you all now what you can do is you can select multiple lines look at this and then you can right click and unfold them all together so you can do unfold symmetrically you can do unfold you can unfold just the pattern and that's another update we've made so you can unfold just the pattern so here I have my pattern and I want to unfold with symmetric editing but then I have the internal line to show up in everything but what if I didn't want that internal line now I can just right click and unfold the pattern outline only and then that internal line will stay just on that side and I'll have unfolded the pattern symmetrically know though that this is not a half symmetry pattern so if I edit the other side will not edit with it so like good to know so one quick and easy update we've made to our 2D is now our pattern names are parallel to our Grain Lines so we learned from all of you that that is a lot easier for you all especially when exporting dxfs or anything like that so we have changed it so that all of the pattern names are now parallel to Green lines as you can see so even if you rotate or move the green line the names will stay parallel to it so originally before 7.2 when you switched different sizes the notch would automatically move to match up to that measurement and everything however we learned that not everybody always wants this so we've now given you an option of fixed or ratio you have the option of changing this both within your file or when you're even importing a dxf so you hear when I import my dxf I have my Notch position option and I can select fixed or ratio I'm gonna do fixed now with my patterns brought in I'll switch to my greeting and show you that with fixed if I move between the sizes you'll see that it's fixed based off of where it should be so here you'll see this a little bit better when it's all lined up on the bottom that actually the notch does not move it stays in its fixed position you can also adjust these and have your option when you select your Notch using your Notch tool and here in your property editor you can select fixed or not so here when I turned on fixed I can then again adjust my measurement uh switch between my graded sizes and it'll all be fixed as you can see here we have made some updates to grading exciting one of the great updates we've made is the copying and pasting so now I can copy of course but what the new thing is is I can paste just X or I can paste just Y X or Y or of course you can do both and their shortcuts to both too so if you want to be really fast and click on all of this you can use the shortcuts that we have in there as well I can also do the mirror pasting as well so I could paste it as a mirror or I can just paste it as normal X or Y and everything this is going to be really helpful to speed up your grading process we hope because maybe you just need to do one point and then you can just copy and paste it everywhere another update we've made is now when you select a point using your grading tools you automatically see the X and Y values pretty nifty so we have updated our print layout mode really excited to show you this one of the updates we've made is with being able to actually set your length for your role of fabric because as we know when you lay out your fabric you only have a long enough table uh so you have to work within those constraints so here I'm going to set up my print layout I'm going to set how the unit and everything I'm going to Now set how long it is and the length so now when I hit play my algorithm will create the overlaps and everything and then it will actually make a second marker if need be if I have more patterns than the first marker will allow and then what will happen is that second marker will actually show up off to the right like it is right now which is really cool so this is a way to see like if you need to move things around or anything like that and also being able to adjust and change that length is really helpful and nice and you can see it also at the top here so really cool another really great update we've made with this is you can now see your grading sizes Within your editor so if I go over here I can now again I've added in my grading sizes and in the toggle menu at the top I can actually turn on coloring so that each color coincides with a graded size and I can also turn on naming so that I can see all of the graded names so it's really helpful you're now able to see all of the graded sizes a lot easier and faster which is pretty great so we have updated some stuff in our colorway editor one of the updates we've made is with our top stitching so here if I select my top stitching I'll actually see it selected in my 3D window so this will be really helpful if you have a bunch of top stitching and you just want to see which one was selected within your 3D window you can just easily select click on it and then it will highlight and show the same will happen for graphics there is one caveat to this though for top stitching it has to be a texture for you to see it if it's an obj top Stitch you won't see it but with Graphics you'll see it no matter what this is again to help you understand where these are placed within your window another update we've made is when you select a fabric within your colorway it is automatically selected also within your object browser and you'll also see your trims highlighted as well when you select them in your colorway they'll highlight in your 3D space as well so now you're able to really tell like where everything is placed and stuff just cool I mean it might not be cool but it's definitely helpful so we've updated some stuff with materials first thing is our new logo for Adobe substance really quick and little tiny little change but just so you all know here I'll go in to my materials and these are the substance materials and you'll see over here that the icon has slightly changed to a different uh logo and look to it when I bring this in it will also have that new and updated icon within the object browser as well so and in the property editor too pretty quick and easy all right another update we've made is with our over seam line graphic so this is really fun now we've improved graphics for over the seam line to work with patch pockets and other pockets as well so all you have to first do is make sure you create your subset layers so here I'll bring in first my graphic have it placed on everything and now what I want is I want it so that the graphic extends on top of the pocket as well so I'll turn on over the seam line but first I have to make sure that I set myself that layers as I said before so I'm going to turn on set subset layers and I'm going to select my pocket and put that on top of my shirt and as you can see immediately now the graphic shows pretty cool right it's something a lot of you have wanted for a while you're welcome so again all you have to do is make sure you state which one's on top which one's on bottom so this will even work if it's going over seems as uh like side seams and everything too which is really great so here again I'll say like over the seam line it will just naturally work for the other side but then to get it on the pockets as well I just have to go to subset and then say like on top or whichever another update with materials is with our zippers because we know a zipper update is something everybody loves so now what you could do in previous versions is you could edit the components of the zipper separately but now in this update you can also save them out separately so first what I'm going to do is I'm going to adjust each component a little bit differently so giving them different colors different sizes different types and all of that looking super cute and fun okay looking great now I have all of the zippers here and saved I'm going to go to save and name this and then hit OK and now what I can do is Select each part that I want saved so I can unselect them I can uncheck them I can check certain ones on and this is how I can save them out separately if I wanted to I want to say them all as one group though and hit OK now what's also pretty nifty is I can then bring them all in together if I wanted to into a new style and also what's cool is uh this all is reflected in our bom editor Isn't that cool so now if I go into another colorway or whichever I'll see that each zippers component is actually separated out within the bom Nifty right so before you had a limitation to how short the fur could be for rendering now in 7.2 we have taken that limitation away which will be really helpful for flocking and some home good fabrics and all of that because now you have no minimum of length for fur so here I can have as low as 0.01 Burling and it will still work within the rendering window which is really great and it's going to just make it so that more of your Fabrics are more realistic and you can keep playing around and adjust as you can see here this is what the old minimum used to be this is the new with 7.2 we have updated our scenes and props to allow you to now import them all together with the render properties and everything and save them all together as well so let me first create a scene so here I'm going to bring in a background make sure I load it as a scene in props and then I'm going to bring in some more over here I can check my scene and prop section here to see they are now I have my scene all set up of course I can select either one of these maybe adjust or change the placement of any of this very quickly and easily now that I have this setup I'm gonna go into render and I'm going to now add in the lighting that I want for this as you know we have a lot of preset options that you can now use which we gave you in our last release I believe and now what I can do is go to file save as seen in props and what this will do is it will save both the scene and the props along with the rendering uh lighting as well so here I'm going to just say this as background and what's nice is it allows you to prepare and kind of do like a prep work and then you can make your garment and all of that or you could make like a bunch of scenes and everything save them all out and then give them to your designers for them to always like recycle through but here I have my Garmin and what I'm going to do is bring in my what I just created so I'm going to go to file add scene and props and I'm going to find that file that I just created my background and I want to make sure I add in both the scene and the rendering properties so I'm going to add both of those in and I'm going to hit OK so now I have my scene and everything all set up here what I can do is I can still adjust this if I'd like because they are still separate so if I wanted to move the plant around I could and make any adjustments I need because they were all saved separately I also can like adjust the textures and all of that stuff so here I'm going to jump into my render window to check out how this all looks that is some cool renderings so moody I love it true fashion here another update we've made to our rendering is giving more options for the color mapping so in our settings for render you can see over here in color mapping there's now types so let's use this first new type and what you can see here is it'll control the burn value so here I'm going to go to Interactive and what this is going to help in is correcting that over exposure that sometimes happens when you have very light colored Fabrics against a light colored background so here I'm going to decrease from 1 to 0.5 for my burn value and I'm going to turn on my interaction again and as you'll see here now this looks a lot better instead of the Overexposed image that we had before another option we now have is the HSV option now this is going to adjust the saturation of the image and color so again it's going to work with the exposure but make it so that the color is a little bit better as well as you can see here so two great options in which to make your images even better when rendering here are some examples of how this works we have quite a few new UI updates this first one that we're going to go through is an update to downloading so originally when you had your downloads you have like that little n for new and you can download and you can download an icon view but now if you switch to a list view you'll still be able to download those specific ones so if I scroll all the way down you'll see here some of the ones that I could download and I can just check these on and decide to download them which is really quick and easy and a nice little update that we've made another update we've made is with our object browser and dragging and dropping so when you drag and drop a fabric or trim or anything you now have the option if you go into user settings and how you would like that dropped item replacing the original you either can have it so that the name is always replaced by the new one or you can make it so that the original one always keeps its name so now when I drag and drop this I selected to make sure that the new fabric is always replacing the old fabric for the name but you could have picked the other way around as you can see here it works perfectly but now you have the options of choosing what you would like and here what will happen if I chose the other option the original name will always stay and the fabric will just be updated so we've adjusted the title menu color so that you can see and understand it a little bit better to a folder and another gray font so that you don't think that it's a deactivated option or anything anymore another quick and easy update we've made is concerning our color palette so now when you open up your color palette window you'll see the options reflect similar to other options we have within Khloe so now you can apply and close apply or just cancel and another update we've made to our UI is with our press tool now with the press tool you'll see a little inscription next to it that explains what you should do with the tool and that you can select the different sides to press if you'd like thank you so much for watching this video we hope you enjoyed it and you learned a lot again if you have any questions please use the comment section one of the Khloe 3D designers will get back to you on it and please enjoy 7.2 and don't forget to like And subscribe there's so many great videos that we've made to help you learn more and enjoy Khloe even more ",

        "Summary": "## Comprehensive Guide to the New Roll Feature in Khloe 7.1 ### Overview In this tutorial, we will explore the new roll feature introduced in the Khloe 7.1 release, which simplifies the process of rolling cuffs on garments, such as denim pants. This feature allows users to create rolled hems without the need for additional internal lines or complex arrangements. ### Definitions - **Roll Up Feature**: A tool in Khloe that enables users to quickly and efficiently create rolled cuffs on fabric patterns. - **2D Window**: The interface where you can view and manipulate the flat pattern of your garment. - **3D Avatar**: A digital representation of the garment that allows you to visualize how it will look when worn. - **Simulation**: A function in Khloe that simulates how fabric behaves in a real-world scenario, allowing for more realistic visualizations. ### Step-by-Step Instructions #### Step 1: Access Your Pattern 1. Open Khloe and load your project containing the denim jeans pattern. 2. Navigate to the **2D Window** where you can view the flat pattern. #### Step 2: Select the Hem 1. Use the **Edit Pattern Tool** to select both the front and back hems of your denim jeans. 2. Make sure to select the full circumference of the hem to ensure a complete roll. #### Step 3: Access the Roll Up Feature 1. Right-click on the selected hem to open the drop-down context menu. 2. Look for the **Roll Up** option, which is a new addition in the 7.1 release. #### Step 4: Configure the Roll Up 1. Once you select **Roll Up**, a pop-up window will appear. 2. Input the following details: - **Roll Up Amount**: Specify how many times you want to roll the hem. The maximum is three times. - **Distance**: Adjust the distance of the roll. For a standard denim cuff, about **1.5 inches** is typically appropriate. 3. Click **OK** to apply the changes. #### Step 5: View the Results 1. The program will take a few seconds to process the roll-up. 2. Once complete, switch to the **3D Avatar** view to see the rolled cuff on your jeans. 3. If necessary, turn on **Simulation** to see how the rolled hem falls naturally. #### Step 6: Final Adjustments 1. Zoom in on the rolled hem to inspect the details. 2. You should see the hem folded up and back in on itself, reflecting the number of rolls applied. 3. Repeat the process for the other side of the jeans if needed. ### Tips and Tricks - **Experiment with Distances**: Depending on the fabric type, you may want to adjust the rolling distance to achieve the desired look. - **Use Simulation**: Always turn on simulation to get a better understanding of how the fabric behaves after rolling. - **Practice**: Familiarize yourself with the roll feature by practicing on different patterns to see how it works with various styles. - **Keep it Symmetrical**: While the roll feature currently does not work with symmetry, you can manually mirror your adjustments on the other side of the garment. ### Conclusion The new roll feature in Khloe 7.1 significantly streamlines the process of creating rolled hems on garments. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can easily enhance your designs with professionally rolled cuffs, saving you both time and effort.

        "Transcript": "hi everyone and welcome to the mimic Productions Khloe 3D webinar I will be speaking on behalf of mimic Productions to tell you a little bit about our company what we do and how our work translates into clothing mimic Productions was founded in 2012 and we are known for our highly realistic 3D avatars although this is what we specialize in we also do a full character pipeline which includes scanning motion capture rigging animation and so on we are based in Berlin and have quite an international team of artists and technicians and are lucky enough to also have our studio in a historical building in vetting Berlin although the quality of our avatars are at this film level and have often been used for film use cases we have worked very hard in the past years to translate this quality into real-time use cases as more and more Industries and artists individuals become interested in using 3D avatars or 3D in general it's very important that our characters can work in these real-time use cases not only for rendering but also live performances and this has been quite a focus for our team in the past years then we could also taken advantage of working with Khloe 3D for a range of projects in various Industries not just fashion but also gaming advertising and even for virtual influencers we get quite high quality simulation result which is on par with our characters and works really well in the final product some examples where we have used clue 3D was for emiratukanu for a Vodafone advertisement at Piccadilly Square we also worked on a campaign for Burberry featuring Naomi Campbell a campaign from Marco Polo and most recently we've been creating garments for retail spaces in the metaverse what makes mimics Avatar special we specialize in creating highly realistic avatars and preferably for multiple use cases also in recent years we've been tasked with bringing that realism and functionality into cloth 3D Although our goal is to achieve realism it's also to ensure that these assets will translate into various platforms we work to not only focus on the modeling and texturing but also the integration and shading of these assets this is just to make sure that they can work across the board and that our clients have a bit more freedom with the assets we've also worked to improve body deformations and our animation and bringing work flow we often like to use Maya as kind of our main point to bring in these more realistic deformations and key areas like the elbows knees and hips so that this animation can be baked down and applied into Khloe as you saw in the video we've also worked to try to optimize these rigs so they work more directly in viewports of programs such as Khloe so that designers are individuals designing garments can see this directly in their viewport in real time rather than having to go through baking poses or animation we've also worked to introduce specialized blend shapes to our rigs to help prevent issues of body on body collision when the Avatar has been posed or animated often you know in areas like underneath the armpit the arm will touch you know the upper side and this can definitely create a simulation that is not so realistic and can cause snagging clipping or pulling and we've worked to add these specialized blend shapes to ensure that the cloth is stimulating as best as it can as it would in real time and sits more naturally in these key areas we also work as mentioned previously to make sure that these assets are versatile that the same assets or base set of assets that we would give you could go into not only a real-time engine but could also be used in an offline rendering use case or a cloud 3D that's very important to us especially the way the industry is developing to ensure that our assets are versatile and can be used in multiple different ways oh and now that we've gone through a little bit about mimic what we do um what makes our character special how we've utilized Khloe and how we've even adapted our characters to work better in Globe um I would now like to take you through a little bit about our Pipeline and a technical walkthrough of how we would prepare one of our characters for forklow how we would set them up taking them from Maya into Khloe up to the point of simulation so we'll start off with the Avatar introduction we'll go through a little of our general Avatar setup preferred poly count break and texture Maps so for the Avatar setup video you see here uh we're showing a standard joint only skeleton hierarchy that we use this will also go into the different Geo groups we of course first have our head and body Shield which you can see here and then of course we have our iGo Group which for us normally consists of lashes lacrimal wetness and the eyeball and then of course we have our Geo Group for the hair and something you don't see in this video but it was included in the head and body Geo was the teeth and mouth bag which is a standard that's included with our avatars as well um even if you know the character isn't really intended to have a facial break upon its conception we always include this just in case it would need it down the road um and it also was much better having that in place for General facial structure development uh throughout the production process for the poly count we often like to have a character between 70 to 80k vertices for the head and body of course we have an additional number below which is including the igos this has been quite successful for us going across different platforms and still maintaining a realistic look of the character of course we are always able to offer another kind of LOD option for the character if this is too high but often for us this is a nice sweet spot in terms of the poly count to maintain that realism across different types of engines and programs and for the rig we have here the um our kind of standard rig setup this video is kind of taking you through examples of how the corrective spoken about previously worked to help correct key areas like the shoulders knees and hips this rig in particular is a combination of both corrective joints and blend shapes and depending on what your final uh animation format needs would be you would kind of maybe make a decision when going into clothes whether you want to stick with corrective blend shapes or joints if you're more interested in seeing these deformations looking nice in the viewport of clue you might maybe lean more towards corrective joints whereas if you are going to break down animation you could definitely have a mix or corrective blend shapes and this is here you know it was a nice example of showing how that hip deformation is getting corrected and here we're switching over to the control rig version of the humanite the hik control rig and just how you could work with it this way in Maya when you switch over that way of course um you know once you have your rig established um have your character in Maya uh before we would go into the next steps of bringing this character into Chloe we would want to make sure that we also have our material IDs applied and this would go for any and gender program and it we would basically like in the video I mean it's a pretty um straightforward setup um uh we just open up the hyper shade which is where we're selecting these materials and applying what we need to for the different maps that get applied to the head or body and having this setup is always an important step it allows us to see the diffuse you know when you bring the character into Khloe of course you have to set up the remaining maps in the Shader manually once you get into Khloe but having this done on the rig before you go into the next steps is important and then lastly we have our texture Maps um so the texture maps that we would normally use for cloth or D with for the body and head would be a diffuse that is combined with an ambient occlusion so this would be one map these two combined together along with the roughness normal and thickness map and this is our standard setup for characters going into glow and we although we normally create these at 4K we do like to make sure that they are available in 2K and 1K as well if we have clients that are going to be working primarily in Clove because it's always nice to have a bit more flexibility with the weight of the scene by being able to maybe take a lower resolution set of maps and being able to kind of pick and choose that way um it is worth noting that the hair Maps we use are a slightly different selection of maps as one could imagine and uh for that setup it's normally an alpha diffuse roughness opacity and normal we've had a pretty good results with hair um using those standard set of maps and yeah this is our kind of Base approach there and um outside of the changes in resolution we pretty much are able to use these same Maps across the board of course we compile we combine the diffuse and the um ambient occlusion map together and normally for unreal or something you would not do this but generally these are all coming from the same Source map so they are still versatile now that we've gone over our general Avatar setup our break our texture maps and essentially all the elements that make up one of our characters The Next Step would be talking about how we prepare that Avatar and the animations for exporting and bringing into Khloe and the integration process that we go through when taking one of our characters into Khloe and the adjustments we make to get them at the realism or the look that we would like so one of our first steps once we have the rig established and the animation or pose ready would be to First double check this Maya make sure that everything is as it should be this would also be the time that we would you know look at the character and see if one of these Special Blend shapes that we've developed may be needed for better simulation in this case it might be nice to have our armpit blend shape applied to prevent any issues with the Garment simulation in that area as mentioned in previous slides sometimes when the body collides with itself that can cause snagging or pulling during the simulation process so in this case having that activated could help and we can see that the animation is still working okay with that unshaped applied there's no issues and this animation would be considered ready to go um in this case because it is an animation we would export it and use it as an fbx and in this video we have a pose so we would go through the same uh steps that we did with the animation making sure that our blend shape is applied and that the pose is looking as it should and then we would go through our exporting process uh for us when we go to export we would first go to select the hierarchy and bake um the end well in this case baking the joints and blend shapes for the pose so that this can be exported properly and this would also be the same case for an animation um but for an animation we would then export this as an fbx and in this case for the pose we'll treat this a little differently once we bring it into clue we do want to make sure that once we have baked the joints and blend shapes that we do delete the control and rig groups in the character group and select the Raven character groups in the outliner from there you can go and Export your selection into fbx format and once we've exported everything that we think we will need to bring into Khloe the first step is going to be bringing our character into Khloe and making any of the needed adjustments there and saving this character out is an ABT so once we bring our character in we should have the diffuse visible you'll see that there's a few issues with the hair and the eyes which we will correct and we also want to get a few more details in there so we're first going to start off by selecting and applying the skin material to the body and face material IDs and one of the first maps that will go in and add is the normal map and once we get that into the slot we will set that at 100. once we've completed that step we'll go into the roughness and inputting this to map instead of intensity and applying the roughness map into the slot and changing that intensity to 55.   we would then want to bring in the thickness map and we would put this into all three color maps for the subsurface scattering once we've completed this we do want to go in and address these ideas because they are fully transparent we want to turn those off and just leave the eyelashes and Eyeball geometry visible once we've kind of hidden those we do want to go in and change the eye roughness and put that at zero and the reflection at 100 so we get this glossy effect to still get a feeling that the eyeball itself does have that wetness there and is a bit more reflective and once we've adjusted the eyes we want to go in on the hair we'll change the opacity mode to RGB and then we of course want to go in and adjust the roughness um specular normal similar to what we did for the skin materials for the reflection intensity we will put that at 45 and of course for the normal we will put this at 100 as well   Avatar setup from this point we would go through and double check that we're happy with everything um and see if there's any other additional updates that we would want to integrate for this character or apply to the character I should say and one thing that we do like to do is actually multiply um Rao on the diffuse and we do this just to give um a bit more Shadow and feeling of depth on the character it isn't a massive change but it can really help in certain areas where you want to get a bit more depth particularly around the eyes ears face um in this example that you're looking at you'll see I think the most obvious place that you can see it is underneath the armpits you definitely get a sense of that shadow there where as on the right side it's definitely not as visible and this is a nice technique that we like to add to get just a little bit more depth and realism on the characters directly in the viewport and once we've applied these adjustments we're happy with our shaders this would be the time where we would save this character out as an avt and this will basically save all of these settings we've just gone through and adjusted so that when we bring the character in again as an avt we don't have to manually set this up anymore and the character will be ready to go to have any animation or poses applied to it and this would be the moment that we do uh go in and apply our pose this is the character brought in as an avt and we'll apply the pose that we saved out earlier and there we have it and at this point we would we've checked our pose if we're happy with it and everything looks like it's acting the way it should we would bring in any garments that we would want to simulate and go from there and this would pretty much be the same approach for the animation of course the animation is as an fbx um with our poses as mentioned we would bring them in as an fbx and always see them out pose file this makes it a bit easier later for dragging and dropping different poses directly into Khloe and getting that immediate result but in this case you would also bring in your fbx to apply your animation and from there you would be able to simulate and that concludes our general overview of not only a little bit about mimic but the characters we develop and how we optimize and integrate these characters for Khloe I hope that everyone had a good time listening in and that this was informative or definitely um it's a pleasure for us to be here so big thanks to Khloe for inviting us and a big thanks to everyone for joining ",
        "Summary": "# Comprehensive Guide to Mimic Productions Webinar on Khloe 3D ## Overview This guide provides a detailed overview of the processes discussed in the Mimic Productions webinar on Khloe 3D. It includes step-by-step instructions, definitions of key terms, and helpful tips and tricks for creating highly realistic 3D avatars and their integration into Khloe for clothing simulation. ## Company Background ### About Mimic Productions - **Founded**: 2012 - **Location**: Berlin, Germany - **Specialization**: Highly realistic 3D avatars and a full character pipeline (scanning, motion capture, rigging, animation). - **Use Cases**: Film, fashion, gaming, advertising, and virtual influencers. ### Key Features of Mimic Productions Avatars - Realistic character modeling and animation. - Versatile assets for multiple platforms (real-time engines and offline rendering). - Focus on body deformations and animation workflows using Maya. ## Avatar Setup and Preparation ### 1. Avatar Introduction - **Skeleton Hierarchy**: Use a standard joint-only skeleton hierarchy. - **Geo Groups**: Categorize geometry into head, body, eyes, hair, teeth, and mouth. ### 2. Poly Count - **Preferred Range**: 70,000 to 80,000 vertices for head and body. - **LOD Options**: Offer lower poly counts if needed for performance. ### 3. Rigging - **Rig Setup**: Use corrective joints and blend shapes for realistic deformations. - **Key Areas for Correction**: Shoulders, knees, and hips. ### 4. Material Setup - **Material IDs**: Apply material IDs for various parts (skin, eyes, hair). - **Hyper Shade**: Use Maya's Hyper Shade to set up materials before exporting. ### 5. Texture Maps - **Standard Maps for Body/Head**: - Diffuse combined with Ambient Occlusion. - Roughness, Normal, Thickness maps. - Create 4K, 2K, and 1K maps for flexibility. - **Hair Maps**: Use alpha, diffuse, roughness, opacity, and normal maps. ## Exporting Process ### 6. Exporting from Maya to Khloe - **Animation/Pose Preparation**: Ensure blend shapes are activated as needed. - **Export Formats**: Use FBX for animation and poses. - **Hierarchy Selection**: Select necessary character groups and export. ### 7. Importing into Khloe - **Character Import**: Import the character and address any issues with hair and eyes. - **Setting Up Materials**: - Apply skin material to body and face. - Adjust normal, roughness, and thickness maps accordingly. ### 8. Shader Adjustments - **Eye Settings**: Adjust eye roughness and reflection for a wet look. - **Hair Settings**: Modify opacity, roughness, and specularity. - **Depth Enhancement**: Multiply the diffuse to add depth, particularly around facial features. ### 9. Saving Character Settings - **Save as ABT**: Save character settings so they can be reused without manual adjustments. ## Simulation Process ### 10. Applying Poses and Animation - **Pose Application**: Load the character as an ABT and apply saved poses. - **Simulation Setup**: Bring in garments for simulation. ### 11. Animation Integration - **Import Animation**: Bring animations in as FBX files. - **Simulate Garments**: Start garment simulation based on the applied animation. ## Tips and Tricks - **Blend Shapes**: Use specialized blend shapes to avoid body collision issues during simulation (e.g., armpit blend shapes). - **Real-Time Viewing**: Optimize rigs and setups for real-time viewing in Khloe without needing to bake animations. - **Texture Resolutions**: Providing different resolutions of texture maps offers flexibility for various performance needs. - **Shader Adjustments**: Small tweaks in shaders can significantly enhance realism, especially in character features like eyes and skin. ## Conclusion This guide highlights the critical processes and techniques shared in the webinar by Mimic Productions regarding the creation and integration of realistic 3D avatars into Khloe. By following these steps and utilizing the tips provided, users can enhance their workflow in 3D avatar creation and clothing simulation."
