        "Transcript": "hello everyone in this video we're going to be going over the updated parametric pattern and make a cropped Bolero jacket the parametric pattern gives Khloe users the ability to create a first draft of a pattern without having prior drafting knowledge all you need are basic garment measurements taken from any standard garment you might already have in your closet the parametric pattern tool or window can be opened if you go to the top of your screen editor tab parametric pattern and once you select the parametric pattern it will open this window where you can now enter your measurements for your front body you could choose between symmetric and half symmetric pattern pieces once you choose one of these options you're going to see the pattern pieces appear in your 2D window you can do the exact same for your back body again for this I'm going to be choosing symmetric for my front and half symmetric for my back the body front has nine unique measurements that can be added in your front pattern pieces we can see those visually represented here on the screen your front length has two different options either from your high point shoulder or your Center front I'm going with my high point shoulder your neck opening neck drop across shoulder and shoulder slope only have one number option to input your across front as well as your cross bust chest also do have options to choose from in the drop down menu your armhole length will again only have one measurement that can be added in when choosing to do your hem slash sweep you can choose to put in your hemsweep front and hem sweep back separately or if you check on total whatever number you put into your hem sweep will evenly be evenly divided between the front and the back of your hem of the Garment you are creating the body back measurements like our body front have nine unique measurements that can be added in from our pattern pieces we can see those visually represented here on the screen for our body back our back length again has two different options we can choose from either our high point shoulder or Center back our neck opening neck drop across shoulder shoulder drop only have one number that we can input are across back as well as across a bust do have drop down options to choose from for our measurements our harm our Palm length again only has one option to be input and for here our hem sweep because I chose total above I have no options to choose from and it is in fact grayed out so I cannot choose anything our final section is body sleeves if we choose to want sleeves on our garment we simply need to check on our sleeves you'll instantly see a single sleeve pattern appear in the 2D window by checking on symmetry Khloe will add in a second pattern piece for symmetric sleeves for both the right and left sides the body sleeves have six unique measurements that can be added for Our Sleeve patterns we can see those visually represented here on the screen we can now enter in our final measurements for our sleeves these include the length cap to opening our cap height our cap width our bicep width which does have options to choose from and finally Our Sleeve opening once we have entered in all of these different measurements we are now ready to generate our pattern in Khloe if for any reason we do not like the measurements that we have put in we can always reset back to the default numbers and continue working if we do like what we have created and see in our 2D screen we can go ahead and click the create button this will then allow us to select our pattern pieces in the 2D window and move them into place once you like where your pattern pieces are you simply need to left click and clove will generate those pattern pieces for you I already had a lightweight denim in my object browser so Khloe has automatically assigned that fabric to my pattern pieces I can now go ahead and click the x button in the upper right hand corner of the parametric pattern window to close that window and I will now be able to see my 3D window we can now see that with this newest update to parametric pattern Khloe is not only arrange those pattern pieces around my avatar but it is also automatically sewn everything together all we need to do is either hit the space bar or hit click the simulation button on our 3D toolbar and Khloe will automatically simulate our garment together with the basic pattern already completed arranged and sewn we can now choose of course to make any further edits we want in our 2D or 3D window I hope that you enjoyed today's video and don't forget to like And subscribe thank you so much ",
        "Summary": "# Comprehensive Guide to Creating a Cropped Bolero Jacket Using the Parametric Pattern Tool in Khloe This guide provides step-by-step instructions, definitions, and helpful tips for using the updated parametric pattern tool in Khloe to create a cropped Bolero jacket. ## What is the Parametric Pattern Tool? The parametric pattern tool in Khloe allows users to create a first draft of a garment pattern without needing prior drafting knowledge. By entering basic garment measurements, users can generate a pattern for various styles quickly. ## Step-by-Step Instructions ### Step 1: Open the Parametric Pattern Tool 1. **Navigate to the Editor Tab**: - Go to the top of your screen and click on the **Editor** tab. 2. **Select Parametric Pattern**: - Click on **Parametric Pattern** in the dropdown menu. This will open the parametric pattern window. ### Step 2: Enter Measurements for the Front Body 1. **Choose Pattern Symmetry**: - Select between **Symmetric** or **Half Symmetric** for your front pattern piece. Symmetric means the front piece will be the same on both sides. 2. **Input the Measurements**: - Enter the nine unique measurements for the front pattern: - **Front Length**: Choose between high point shoulder or center front. - **Neck Opening**: Input neck drop. - **Across Shoulder**: Input shoulder slope. - **Across Front**: Input measurements from the dropdown menu. - **Cross Bust**: Input measurements from the dropdown menu. - **Armhole Length**: Only one option to input. - **Hem/Sweep**: Choose between front and back separately or select \"Total\" to evenly distribute the measurement. ### Step 3: Enter Measurements for the Back Body 1. **Choose Symmetry**: - Again, select between **Symmetric** or **Half Symmetric** for your back pattern piece. 2. **Input the Measurements**: - Enter the nine unique measurements for the back pattern: - **Back Length**: Choose between high point shoulder or center back. - **Neck Opening**: Input neck drop. - **Across Shoulder**: Input shoulder drop. - **Across Back**: Input measurements from the dropdown menu. - **Cross Bust**: Input measurements from the dropdown menu. - **Armhole Length**: Only one option to input. - **Hem/Sweep**: If \"Total\" was selected, this will be grayed out. ### Step 4: Add Sleeve Measurements 1. **Enable Sleeves**: - Check the box for sleeves. A single sleeve pattern will appear in the 2D window. 2. **Choose Symmetry**: - If you check on symmetry, Khloe will create a second sleeve piece for both the right and left sides. 3. **Input Sleeve Measurements**: - Enter the six unique measurements for the sleeve: - **Sleeve Length**: Measure from shoulder to desired length. - **Cap Height**: Measure for the sleeve cap. - **Cap Width**: Measure across the top of the sleeve cap. - **Bicep Width**: Select from dropdown options. - **Sleeve Opening**: Input measurement for the sleeve opening. ### Step 5: Generate the Pattern 1. **Review Measurements**: - Ensure all measurements are accurately entered. If adjustments are needed, you can reset to default values. 2. **Create the Pattern**: - Click the **Create** button to generate the pattern. 3. **Position Pattern Pieces**: - In the 2D window, select and move the pattern pieces into place using a left click. ### Step 6: Close the Parametric Pattern Window 1. **Assign Fabric**: - Khloe will automatically assign the fabric (e.g., lightweight denim) that you have in your object browser. 2. **Close the Window**: - Click the **X** button in the upper right corner of the parametric pattern window to exit. ### Step 7: View in 3D 1. **Switch to 3D Window**: - You will now see your garment arranged on the avatar in the 3D window. 2. **Simulate the Garment**: - Press the **Space Bar** or click the **Simulation** button in the 3D toolbar to simulate the garment. ### Step 8: Make Further Edits 1. **Edit in 2D or 3D**: - You can choose to make further edits to your pattern in either the 2D or 3D views. ## Definitions - **Symmetric Pattern**: A pattern that is identical on both sides. - **Half Symmetric Pattern**: A pattern that is only designed on one side, often used for asymmetrical designs. - **Cap Height**: The height of the sleeve cap, which determines how the sleeve sits on the shoulder. - **Hem/Sweep**: The bottom edge of the garment, which can be adjusted for style. ## Tips and Tricks - **Take Accurate Measurements**: Use a measuring tape to get precise garment measurements from existing clothing. - **Experiment with Different Fabrics**: You can switch fabrics within the object browser to see how different materials affect the drape and look of the garment. - **Save Your Work**: Regularly save your project in Khloe to avoid losing any progress. - **Use the Simulation Feature**: Always simulate your garment to see how it will behave in real life, allowing you to make necessary adjustments. - **Watch Tutorials**: If you are new to Khloe, consider watching additional tutorials for more advanced techniques. This guide should help you navigate the process of creating a cropped Bolero jacket using the parametric pattern tool effectively. Enjoy your sewing project!"

        "Transcript": "today we are going to create skirts using the pleats fold tool along with this we are also going to use the spiral tool to help with creating a circular pattern and also the pleat sewing tool to sew our box pleat skirt start with our Sun Ray pleat skirt I'm going to start by using the rectangle tool and create a pattern piece for my waistband that is 31 inches wide and two inches high and then going to use the fullness line tool to add some shape to my waistband I'm going to arrange it around the Avatar I'm going to add a little bit of strength in it to help me while I am working then I'm going to sew the center back together and then I'm going to simulate it after it's in place where I want it I'm going to freeze it so that I can sew to it and it so that it doesn't move next let's create the skirt pattern piece now this could be done similar to the way we just did the waistband but let's do something a little different and let's use the spiral tool here and if you do this by changing the measurements in a particular order it will be much easier to do I'm going to regular click once here so that I get my create spiral dialog box and I'm going to change the measurements in a particular order I'm going to change my side measurements both to 12. then I'm going to change my radius inner to 12. then I'm going to change the offset to zero and finally I'm going to change the inner length to 31 so that it matches the length of my waistband and I'm going to click ok now I have a circular pattern piece that is a particular length 12 inches and the seam that will be sewn to our waistband matches here at 31 inches I'm going to rotate my pattern piece here so that the opening is towards the back then I'm going to right click on it here in the 3D window and say reset 2D arrangement while I'm here in the 3D window I'm going to move this into place because this is a circular pattern piece using the arrangement points really isn't going to work for us here but what I have done here is I have placed this generally where this is going to go so that the back Center seam is sewn in place and so the edges that will be sewn to here together from the waistband to the skirt itself are in place if you would like you can go ahead right now and segment so your waistband to your skirt we need internal lines here so that we can fold these it's a little bit mathematical what I'm going to do is I am going to shift select these two segments that give me the length of my skirt and I am going to right click and say distribute internal line between segment by default it gives you one now you can add as many as you would like I am going to actually add 51 internal lines and I will show you why exactly that odd number my internal lines have been added here and there they are in my 3D window while they are still selected I am going to check fold rendering this will give me nice crisp Folds now I'm going to strengthen the skirt and if you have not done so go ahead and make sure that your waistband is sewn to your skirt now we need to add the folds into our internal lines here and we do this here with our pleats fold tool the idea is that you need to click on either side of the Garment the pattern piece that is to be folded when you have a circular piece like this you can click as many times as you want to make sure that you cover all of the lines once you have gotten through to the other side double click the pleats fold tool dialog box comes up I'm going to Simply select accordion pleats which is going to give us our Sun Ray effect once you're at this point you can simulate it may do some funny things here but then it will settle down and it should be okay now we added an extra pleat here to our skirt the reason I did that if you can see here is so that when I do sew the center back together these will easily come together right here and I can also select this particular sewing segment here and change this custom angle to turn so that when we simulate our seam will have a similar fold as the rest of the pleats in our skirt that is your basic construction of your Sun Ray pleat skirt from here you can now let's create our box pleat skirt in this case what we're going to do is create a shape that is three times as long as the segment of our waistband which is 31 inches so I'm going to create a pattern piece that is 93 inches wide and 12 inches high there is some math involved here I apologize for that next I am going to use my ADD Point split line tool and I am going to right click on the top line this will bring up my split line dialog box and I'm going to uniform uniformly split this line into 96 segments next I am going to use my edit so my edit pattern tool select the two segment lines that make up my height of my skirt pattern piece right click and say distribute internal line between segments we need these lines to match up with our segment points although we divided it into 96 segments there is actually 95 points in there so I'm going to put the number 95 in there and click ok as you can see now I have an equally divided pattern piece that has segment lines running vertically now I'm going to use my pleats fold tool I'm going to click once on the outside here and double click on the left here and I'm going to switch to box pleats now you could leave the number of internal lines per pleat at 2. but I'm going to change it to 3. I have found that this gives you better results this will also divide into the number of fold lines that we added on our pattern piece once again I'm going to add strengthen to this pattern piece so it will help me when I am draping the skirt on here next we're going to use the pleats sewing tool which is under the pleats fold tool and for this I'm going to hide my 3D window so that we can see this a little bit better this works similar to one to multiple sewing I'm going to start with the waistband and as you can see it is a neon color I am clicking on the beginning and the end now I'm going to come to my skirt and I am going to click to begin on the same side and begin to draw this across and if you notice what Khloe is doing it is sewing this in groups of three because I told it to have three segments per pleat I'm going to bring back my 3D window and what I'm going to do here now is I'm going to turn on my Arrangement points and I am going to arrange this on the lowest center Front Arrangement point this particular Arrangement point is called leg skirt front now as you can see this is wrapping around my avatar almost twice that's okay I'm going to come down here in my Arrangement section in my property editor and in the offset section I'm going to press the offset slider all the way to the right this will open up the skirt a bit around the avatar I can then turn off my Arrangement points and my skirt has been folded and sewn in place in the previous part of this video I showed you how to add the fold rendering on the internal lines while those lines were still selected if you need to do the same thing but they're not currently selected what you can do is right click on the background of your 2D window and say lock all pattern outlines then this will allow you to select those internal lines and then turn on your fold rendering just be sure that if you lock your pattern outlines you remember to unlock them before you move forward we're ready to simulate to see how our box pleat skirt came out but what I'm going to do first is I am going to select the skirt pattern piece and in the property editor I am going to reduce the additional thickness Collision from the standard 2.5 millimeters to one millimeter this is going to help our pattern piece fold nicely I'm now going to simulate now again if you remember I added an odd number of folds and segment points this is so we can get our pattern piece to sew together correctly on these two sides you will notice that there's a couple things going on here one this is kinked like this a little bit this has to do with the particle distance what you should also do and you can do this on your other skirt as well is take your edit pattern tool and select just the bottom part of your waistline when that particular segment is selected check elastic here in the property editor and change the ratio to 100. what that will do is that will give the effect of Mobile on taping so that when you simulate here in the 3D window your the edge of your waistband will not become distorted ",
        "Summary": "Creating skirts using the pleats fold tool and the spiral tool can be a fun and creative process.

        "Transcript": "thank you hi everyone Welcome to Cloud tips and tricks we wish you happy holidays if you haven't prepared your ear and card yet this one is for you we will learn how to create a tree with four Maps so let's get started we start with polygon 2. hold down your shift key to go straight click right to insert a number then I make a triangle freestyle and with edit pattern tool click right here and unfold with symmetric editing and then would add a curvature tool we give some round shape here on the bottom and then if you go to the property editor you can check the length of this line here to create another pattern piece that will have the circumference of this value do a short click here and then circumference you put the corresponding value here then we will quickly sew it with free sewing tool I will do it in two times half and half so once you're done with the sewing then we can go to the 3D and arrange this I checked the right and wrong side of the fabric here so that if I'm only applying the fur on the front side of the fabric I can apply normal fabric for the backhand side not to slow down computer too much and here click right to move to ground Center I can also freeze it so that it could be served as a fixed base then let's simulate okay don't forget to sew the side seams here since we are using a basic fabric it keeps falling down maybe we can strengthen it and then it will be easier to manipulate it you can also help it it's taking its form and then with the simulation on I will select both pieces and then add some pressure here so here you can decide also how much volume you want to have and then once you find something you like you can unfreeze it grab this tree and find a nice angle in the position I will just grab here on the top and try to place it in the middle here I press the number key 2 on my keyboard to face the front side and this is going to be the view I will launched the final render width and then here starting with the bottom I will freeze these pieces in case I press my space bar and everything falls down okay now let's move on to the event ring click on the interactive render button to start let's remove the background color to better observe the fur and then maybe make the image size a little bit bigger and then we click on the fabric one and change the type of the fabric to fur here on top of the tree we can observe the thickness and the length of the fair easily as you scroll down you will have the parameters related to the fur here you can play with melanin glossiness values today we start directly with the first shape section starting with the length this is the easiest parameter to observe you can try different numbers here to get an idea of the proportion between your tree shape and furlings and here you can see the direction of the third affected by gravity the direction is decided by the vent value here you can go from zero to one if you put a minimum value 0 here as you can see the third goal perpendicular way to your parent piece as if there were no gravity then if I put the maximum value which is one then the fur is going to be highly affected by the gravity here you can also observe it here on this side okay let me put this value back to zero and then we continue with different values let me lower down a little bit the links okay and then now we play with the thickness the thickness can go up to 10 let me try three here you can check it here on the top again but you can combine with thickness is the taper value this value allows you to have different thickness on the root and the tip of the fur you can go from zero to one the higher the value is thinner the phrase at the tip and vice versa here we have zero and let's try one always takes a bit of time when you are working with a fur so now you can see that at the tip of the fur it's very thin now and then you can also play with the density I go to 10. this will help us better understand the base Maps underneath so with the base maps you can really give specific designs to your fur this is how it looks like it's a grayscale image containing black gray and white color so the white Parts gets the value of one and the black gets zero let me bring in a few of them and see how it is applied here you can observe directly even if you are in interactive render sometimes the changes are not applied to the entire surface in that case don't hesitate to stop and restart the interactive render okay and then I can also try this gradation one for example I will drag and drop to the links section you always have to check also the transformation section because all these base maps have different sizes so depending on the size of your tree you would have to sometimes adjust it maybe this basement map concept seems a little bit complicated at first but if you try a few of them you will quickly understand and get the feeling of how this map work here I'm just playing with different style of maps to show you a few examples I can also continue with the thickness here so as you can observe I get a little gradation on my thickness when you start this for the first time it's always easier if you keep only one of these three parameters so I removed all of them and I'm only keeping one of this so density this time this way it's easier to understand how it works and this base maps are simple image files so that you can create easily on Photoshop illustrator or you can even find black and white image on the internet as well if you want to try out different styles okay so now we played around that a bit let's finalize our tree now I prepared this base map image that I'm going to drag and drop to the links remove the density map to make sure that the base map is read correctly I'm going to stop and restart the interactive render it seems like my base map doesn't have a good size so I'm going to the property editor here and then change the size I will put it to the 30 percentage so I get this Christmas tree form and then maybe now we can also start working with colors I will choose the screen dark green color and then if you scroll down a little bit you have this first relation option where you can add up to three different colors you have the mid color and tip Color part here let me add a little yellow touch to my tree and then white color I like it looks like it has been under the snow so let's keep it since now I have three different colors I might make it a bit longer I put 200 millimeters for example and we can also maybe review the density for now it's not dense enough so that we see the green background 100 now it starts really looking like a Christmas tree all right now I will leave you here so that you can continue play with hope you had fun watching this tutorial if you come up with a nice card please share with us we are always happy to see our users Creations thanks for watching and see you next year ",

        "Transcript": "  hi my name is phoebe and i am the global ux ui design lead and i'm based in the new york office i'm going to right now go through some really great tools and tricks of how you can edit and check patterns within khloe these are really helpful fast ways in which you can quickly edit and adjust your patterns and check them so if you have any questions please use the chat off to the side we'll try to answer them all during this video through there let's get started all right so here i have my 2d window within clone all open and set up so the first thing that we probably want to adjust is the layout of this the lamps are actually really important to make sure it's clean and organized because it's just going to help you edit things a little bit easier and quicker and also if you're not super familiar with patterns if you have it nicely organized um people can understand it a little bit better and also your 3d window will then like reflect it a little bit well as well okay so let's work with how we can organize these patterns so we can select our patterns and the first thing i'm going to do is just make sure that they're all kind of lined up now you can do this in a few ways you can do this by eye or you could even go into this little eye tool right here and you can bring in your rulers and through there you can grab in some guidelines and even help you like line up your workspace through that as well another really great method that you can use is being able to align your patterns kind of like how you can align them in illustrator you can select all of your patterns right click and there's this align option here i could align to my bottom and then making sure that all my pattern pieces align to the bottom now as you probably saw my um this yolk also moved down so i wouldn't want that i would just want these to right click and align to bottom great i can select these two and right click and make sure they're aligned to center so they're both in center and i can even select this and move this down a little bit i can do the same for these sleeves so i could select them right click and say align to bottom and then they'll quickly move down to their bottom okay this is all set up and now i have a much cleaner workspace that everyone can kind of understand which sides go to which and everything speaking of 2d workspaces what a lot of people don't know is this little eye icon here has a lot of great information that you can use really quickly and easily it houses where you can show or hide the names of your pattern along with annotations it also will allow you to show all of the line links that you may want to see along with your brain line you can also show or hide points of measure and as we already know you can show or hide your ruler and hide or show your guidelines another really helpful thing that your 2d toggle menu has is the different fabric view options so you can use uh view your fabrics in a lot of different ways so you can have monochrome surface which is nice if you have a really busy print and you just want to view the prints you can also see your front texture view and you also have this translucent option translucent really great because it allows you to um see through the pattern but you still see like your pattern as well i really like translucent we also have transparent so you'll just see the outline of your patterns and also your mesh view the back view of your fabric and if you have any really complicated patterns we also have a random color view i'm going to be working with my transparent view so that if i ever need to lay pattern pieces on top of each other i can do just that also what's really nice is if you ever need to hide or show baselines you can quickly do that up here with your t-shirt you can hide or show your baselines along with hiding or showing your seam allowance grading   and 3d pen tools reference lines which is always really important to have and also your symmetry before we jump in um to any more editing or stuff there's one other kind of like secret menu i want to show you all that you can do for your clothes screen and different ways in which you can set it up so that it works a little bit better for you so one cool thing is here if you go here to your closed screen right click there's this grid properties option over here now on your grid property option what you can see is you can see your 2d grid and show 2d grid or you can hide it you can also auto adjust distance with zoom what that just means is like when you zoom in you saw how before the boxes were bigger if i uncheck this they're just going to stay tiny no matter how i zoom in or out i like to keep it on then you have the snap to grid option so if you have your pattern pieces like this you can then um snap to grid and there's not to it you also have your distance in inches so this is basically telling you like how big you want all the distances to be you could do 0.5 you could do one inch um or you could do 0.3 which is what it was originally the really awesome update 2 here that you can do is 2d arrow key movements this is allowing you so when you use the arrow keys on your keyboard how much it'll move so if you want it to be really small all the time you could keep it 1.5 or if you wanted it to be like a quarter of an inch every time you could then move it a quarter of an inch every time using your arrow keys what's nice is this is the same for your 3d window you can do the same thing for your 3d arrow movements you could do 2.25 or 0.150 it's really great and then very helpful to help you set up okay so now let's jump into some fun um tools that you can use to edit really easily one really great tool that i like is actually the half symmetry tool so this is great for a collar like this one because if you adjust one side sometimes it's difficult to make sure the other side gets adjusted exactly the same so you can apply half symmetry to this all you have to do is go into your add point slit line tool and create a center point on both the top and bottom so i can just right click and say uniform split and same here right click uniform split okay now i can jump to my transform pattern tool select this pattern right click and say have symmetry i now have my half symmetry applied again it's just this transform pattern tool right here selecting your pattern right clicking and applying half symmetry now what's nice is anything i do to one side will automatically affect the other so here i have some fullness in this collar that i kind of want to close up because i have half symmetry i just have to close it up on one side what's really nice and that has been a nice little update is with our fullness point if you want to close something up but not have the curve affected you can do that now so all you have to do is click i'm going to click on this baseline say i want this side to be closed and if i hold down d my curve will not be adjusted if i release d and i close this up you'll start to see that this like purple line over here is going to be affected but if i hold down d it won't i'm just going to change this to a curve point and then jump back here so again i'm going to hold down d so that the line doesn't get affected if i release d you see how this whole line would have changed it's that dotted purple line that's telling you what it would be i'm going to hold down d and close this up and now my collar has been adjusted another really great um tool that i use a lot especially for when i can't have half symmetry applied to a pattern because they're already like symmetric copies is the duplicate as mirrored internal line this is done using your edit pattern tool the only thing you need to prep is making sure that you have a centered internal line on your pattern so here i can select this line here right click and say duplicate as mirrored internal line this is going to allow me to duplicate this over i'm going to select this internal line as my reference line and once i just click down on that my in my um internal line shows up right here this is nice so if i ever have to adjust or move this around or if i wanted this sleeve to be the exact same as this one i can easily match this up one really nice trick also that i really love using is the replace pattern line option so here i could select this pattern line and then hold down shift and select this internal line and i can right click and we have this replace as pattern outline it is so great like can't even explain to you how great if i just click it it automatically replaces it and i have a reference line of the original it's just magic like love this line it was really helpful a lot of the time for like sleeves like this or even if you are trying to like add fullness to the front and then you want to add it equally to the back which we can do next so if i want to come in here and i'm like hey like i wanted to just like add some fullness right here we could then just select it here right click replace pattern outline and then what you can do is you can take this measurement so it's um 0.830 and then i can do g right click and say 0.830 hit ok and now i can just do the same thing like so simple it's amazing i love it makes your life so much easier another tool that's really great so these are some really great editing tools one really great new editing tool that i love is this ability to lock your lines in place it is so great it makes it so that if you edit something like you're editing your side seam but you don't want your armhole to be adjusted you can now do that like yes all of your like wishes have been granted congratulations so let's let me show you exactly how this can work so with my edit pattern tool here i could select this line right click and say lock and this will now lock that line if i start to move this side seam however like i want this point will not move at all because it's locked in place completely so it's not going to like come in or out or anything like that making it so that you won't have to worry about your armhole getting distorted at all if that doesn't make you smile i don't know what will you can just easily right click and unlock pattern outlines and then you're all set you can also lock points so i could right click select this point right click and lock it this will make it so i could adjust this whole line and this one as well but this point will stay exactly where it should and as we all know there's unlimited undo's so even though i made this pattern crazy i can just control z and everything's okay all right now let's go over some great ways in which you can match up your patterns to make sure that everything is where it should be and stuff so one way that i really love matching up a pattern is by selecting like my shoulder seams here right clicking and saying match up to start this will then match up my patterns and then i can check them all if i wanted to check this whole armhole what i could really easily do too is match these lines up so i could right click and match up to start and then everything's all matched then i could quickly check this armhole make sure it's the right shape that i want and everything to quickly rotate this i could just select my pattern piece here right click and say rotate uh x-axis or y-axis either or i'm going to do x-axis this will make it horizontal then i could go to like my internal line here which i'm using as my grain line and i can just select and make this straight horizontal i could then just use my bounding boxes and rotate them as well if i wanted to what's really nice about this bounding box that you can pair with your um translucent view is you can select like you can move this over or i could match up look at that and i could take my bounding box and double click on this point to be able to move it and activate it and then i can move it right to my armhole and then rotate it so that it rotates along my armhole here i could even check and see like these are two different measurements like this is a little bit too long than this and i could use my um edit pattern tool and actually adjust this i also have to unlock everything and then i can adjust it there's also another way in which i could adjust this so let me select this right click rotate y-axis now this is straight green another really great way in which you can match up patterns is using your walk pattern tool this was really helpful like if anyone remembers back in the day when you had to actually walk a physical pattern and you were just like wow hate paper it's the worst it's so much easier digitally like it's so great so going to this walk pattern tool here you can just select this point and then hit and then the arrow goes right here and then you can just walk your pattern and where you see that it's not like too far i can right click and add a notch to my walked pattern telling me exactly where it is i can then just hit enter and now what i can do is i can go to my notch and add a point and find out what this exact measurement is or from all the things that we've learned today we could do the fun replace pattern and zero it out wouldn't that be nifty okay so we could either figure out this measurement and just retract the line using our offset pattern or you can go to our internal line tool and using this point we can just click here and we can zero it out to wherever it's zeroed we could either just like gradually do this or we could hold down shift and just make sure that it goes to the edge up here i'm going to gradually zero out and then double click to end and now i can just select these right click replace this pattern outline and now i'm all set and if i check this again you'll see that it all matches up okay so now that all of our patterns are all matched up and everything we can now add in some internal lines and like create some fun style lines or anything like that what's really great about this internal lines is we've actually updated them so that you can um like add variations in which you input your internal lines they don't all have to be uniformed in the same measurement apart now you can variate that because more options right okay so let's go into how you can do internal lines so in our edit pattern tool here you can select your bottom line here right click offset as internal line i'm going to do number of offsets let's say like three um okay let's go crazy and say five and now with distance i could do all which is the old uniform way or i could do individual what's great about the individual is now i can decide if i want the individuals to be measured out by the previous line or the selected line which is the first line that you selected let's do selected line first right so with selected line you can then measure these out so i could do like one inch from my selected line and then i want three inches from the selected line and then four inches from the selected line and then six inches from the selected line and the fact that i can do this in my head is a little bit impressive at least to me and then seven inches from the selected line and you can see here that now you have variations going through and they're not all the same measurement now you can also do this if i selected it here right clicked offset as internal line and instead of selected i did previous so here i could do so one inch from the first and then two inches from the last then one inch from this one and then two inches from that one and then one inch from this one and now i have that all set up and i can hit okay thank you so much for watching this i hope you've enjoyed the workshop and that you were able to gain some new knowledge and insight please don't forget that there's a lot of other design workshops and videos for you to watch um try to tune in to them throughout the day ",

        "publishedAt": "2022-11-22T14:00:03Z",
        "Transcript": "  hello everyone my name is anisha and i'm part of the claw india team today i'm going to do a designer workshop on how to create a realistic leather garment i hope you enjoyed this workshop and thank you for tuning in the first thing that we would require for a realistic leather garment look we would require the fabric so i'm going into the fabric library over here and i will be selecting the leather lamp skin and i'm going to drag and drop it over here and when i simulate you will see those little changes in the drape of the jacket and it will be according to how a leather material looks and i'm going to add one of these textures that we have created and it's like a scan of a leather material and then it has been created into a tileable repeat so once you have created this style i'm just going to drag and drop it over here and you can see right now it looks like this it's very raw so i'm just going to select the leather lamp skin over here and going to the material type i'm going to change it into leather i don't need a very intense normal knob i can just keep a 10 and this is the green structure of it so right now it is a bit bigger i am just going to reduce the size of the texture and i'm going to use the edit texture for that and reduce it slightly so i'm going to make it 90 and this is how it's going to look uh to make it a bit more darker i'm just going to add a color to it i'm just going to add a grayish tone to this once we have made changes to the fabric let's look at the seams so how do we select these seams by using the edit sewing tool and after that if i look it into property editor i can see it says 3d sim line so we need to go to the hardware and dreams library and under that we will see a folder called seamline and in there we have two different options this is the one which is by default added into this but there is another one which looks like this so for leather garments i usually use these but right now you can see all the seams are quite raised so we do not want them to be raised we actually want them to be um the opposite like we wanted to create a depression so instead of having a positive 10 or intensity 10 i'm going to keep the value to minus 20 and i'm going to leave the thickness to as it is and you can see that it create that depression and the normal map of the seam like 3d seam line that is created it has that dotted look so it is a very subtle change but this will help you give your leather garment quite a realistic look so if you look at the zipper here right now you can see it has been stretched a bit reset to trim fusible rigid and when i simulate you will see that it will hold its shape and it will not stretch from both the sides and it will look like this so i'm going to do the same thing for all the zippers that we have on this garment by selecting all of them and i'm going to make the same add the same preset over here to all these uh zippers which is trim fusible rigid and since we have already uh selected all of the zippers let me also add the texture for the zipper tape so i'm going to use a vislon zipper texture for this jacket and i'm just going to quickly add it over here and i'm just going to make the intensity 50 and i'm going to make the material type either plastic or metal along with the tape i'm just going to select the zipper puller sliders as well and make a few changes to those as well and in the new version of chloe you can you must have noticed that when you select metal in the metal presets there are some finishes which are already available now let me select the make the changes to my buttons as well so let me go into the object browser and select the snap button and i already have created a texture for this yeah and we have the texture of the rivets as well i'm starting with the basic single needle top stitch which i've just uh already created and saved and i'm going to add this single needle top stitch in a lot of different areas of the jacket so let's start i'm going to add this on the center front okay and that's it for all the this single neutral top stitch uh there is one more single needle club stitch which is going to be closer at 1 by 16 of an inch and i'm use that for my zippers and now i'm going to add the double needle top stitch as you can see here and i'm going to add this to only few areas which require that so i've added all the top stitches and i'm just going to simulate so that my zipper falls into place i'm selecting my edit top stitch tool and i'm going to select um all the top stitches except the one on the waistband at the bottom and i have selected all of them and i'm going to right click on the top stitch and add an internal line on the top in the property editor i'm going to just switch on the elastic and i'm going to make the ratio 97 for some areas like the back i don't need the elastic ratio to be so low i can keep it 99 i'm going to make the same changes for my buttons as well so here you can see that the snap button looks as if it's just stuck on the surface but it doesn't look as if it's been pushed into the material here because it is a button i'm going to use a internal ellipse tool and i'm going to just create a small circle around this button i'm going to reposition it a bit yeah so once i've done this you can see it's over here and i'm going to add an elastic and change the ratio to 97 and there is one more thing that i will add to this internal shape is that i'm going to change the fold angle of this to 270. so i'm going to show you how it looks when i make these changes that i'm going to simulate this so it looks as if the button has been pushed into the material so i'm going to select the same circle and i'm just going to copy paste it on all the areas where i have my button now let's talk about this seam over here so whenever we are sewing a leather jacket or leather garment there would be areas where you create a top stitch on top whereas there will be areas there will be seams which do not have that top stitch on top so this is the um seam where there will be no top stitch here so right now if i do not add any top stitch it looks um it doesn't look natural to a leather garment so what i'm going to do is um i'm going to select the sewing of this seam on both the sides and i'm going to make the fold angle to 270 and when i simulate it will slightly fold a bit to make it look a bit more natural how it looks on a leather garment and after this i'm going to go i'm looking at the top stitch on the center front and i'm going to add puckering over here so let me select the puckering tool and using that i'm just selecting this area and i'm adding the puckering default puckering over here is not characteristic of a leather garment so let let us customize it a bit more i'm going to click on the default puckering and here we have the normal map and the normal map that is over here is of cotton so i'm going to click on this material and i'm going to select leather and it will change the normal map to a leather material so right now we just have a normal map but we can also add a texture to our puckering so i am going to show you the puckering that i am going to um texture that i am going to add to this puckering so you can see on my screen this is the puckering texture that i'm going to add and it has that dots in the center so that is because whenever you sew a leather material it actually punctures the leather and it creates these tiny holes so that's why it will look much more realistic when you add a puckering texture like this so i'm going to drag and drop it over here on the texture of my buckling and here i can see how it looks but it is still not matching the area of the top stitch it is far away from it so i am going to change the specification so density can be 80 and the width can be two right so this way i will be able to match the puckering and the top stitch together and right now it looks very stark white so what i'm going to do is i'm just going to select the color over here and select the color picker tool and match it to the leather that i have so it is somewhere in the same dentin shade and i'm going to make it slightly lighter it's not going to be so this much is enough and i can click ok and that is the that is the top stitch that i will have okay the width seems to be a lot so i'm going to make it one so once i've made customized my puckering according to my top stitch i'm just going to add it in all the areas where this puckering would be relevant so these were some simple steps in achieving a realistic leather garment i hope you enjoyed this workshop and thank you for joining in ",
        "Summary": "# Comprehensive Guide to Creating a Realistic Leather Garment ## Introduction Welcome to the guide on creating a realistic leather garment. This guide is based on a workshop conducted by Anisha from the Claw India team. It will cover all the essential steps, definitions, tips, and tricks needed to achieve a professional-looking leather garment. ## Materials Needed 1. **Fabric**: Leather lamp skin (or any leather-like material). 2. **Textures**: Scanned leather material that is tileable. 3. **Sewing Tools**: Various stitching tools in your software. 4. **Hardware**: Zippers, buttons, snap buttons, and rivets. 5. **Simulation Software**: Ensure you have access to a garment simulation software (e.g., Clo3D, Marvelous Designer). ## Step-by-Step Instructions ### Step 1: Selecting and Setting Up Fabric 1. **Open Fabric Library**: Access your fabric library in the software. 2. **Select Fabric**: Choose the leather lamp skin. 3. **Drag and Drop**: Place the selected fabric onto your work area. 4. **Simulate Changes**: Click on the simulation button to observe how the fabric drapes, creating realistic movement akin to leather. ### Step 2: Applying Textures 1. **Add Texture**: Find the scanned leather texture and drag it over the fabric in your work area. 2. **Adjust Material Type**: Select the leather lamp skin, navigate to the material type, and change it to \"Leather\". 3. **Modify Normal Map**: Set the normal map intensity to a lower value (about 10). 4. **Edit Texture Size**: Adjust the texture size to around 90% for a more realistic look. 5. **Change Color**: Apply a grayish tone to the leather for added depth. ### Step 3: Editing Seams 1. **Select Edit Sewing Tool**: Use this tool to select the seams of the garment. 2. **Access Seamline Library**: Go to the hardware and dreams library. Find and select the \"Seamline\" folder. 3. **Select Seam Type**: Choose a seam that is appropriate for leather garments. 4. **Adjust Seam Depth**: Change the seam depth value from +10 to -20 to create a depression effect. ### Step 4: Working with Zippers 1. **Select Zipper**: Click on the zippers in your garment. 2. **Set Zipper Type**: Reset them to “Trim Fusible Rigid”. 3. **Simulate Changes**: Run the simulation to ensure the zippers hold their shape without stretching. 4. **Add Zipper Texture**: Apply a vislon zipper texture with an intensity of 50. Set material type to either plastic or metal. ### Step 5: Adding Top Stitches 1. **Select Top Stitch Tool**: Use the single needle top stitch for various areas. 2. **Add Stitches**: Apply the top stitch to the center front and other necessary areas. 3. **Use Double Needle Top Stitch**: For specific areas requiring a double stitch. 4. **Simulate**: Ensure the stitches fall into place properly. ### Step 6: Adjusting Elasticity and Puckering 1. **Edit Top Stitch Elasticity**: Select top stitches and adjust the elastic ratio (97% for most areas, 99% for back). 2. **Create Internal Circles for Buttons**: Use the internal ellipse tool to create a circle around each button. 3. **Adjust Fold Angle**: Change the fold angle of the circles to 270 degrees to simulate buttons being pushed into the fabric. 4. **Add Puckering**: Use the puckering tool on top stitch areas to create a realistic effect. 5. **Customize Puckering Texture**: Change the puckering normal map to leather and add a texture mimicking the puncture holes from sewing. ### Step 7: Final Adjustments 1. **Match Puckering with Top Stitch**: Adjust density and width of puckering to harmonize with the top stitch. 2. **Color Matching**: Use the color picker tool to match the puckering color to the leather for seamless integration. ## Tips and Tricks - **Simulation**: Regularly simulate your changes to see how they affect the overall look of the garment. - **Texture Quality**: Use high-quality scanned textures for the best results. - **Experiment with Settings**: Don’t hesitate to adjust settings like intensity and size; small changes can drastically improve realism. - **Layering**: Use multiple layers for textures and adjustments for a more complex and realistic look. - **Save Changes**: Regularly save your work to avoid losing progress. ## Conclusion By following these steps and utilizing the tips provided, you can create a realistic leather garment that showcases your design skills. Practice and experimentation with textures and settings will further enhance your results. Thank you for participating in this workshop!"

        "Transcript": "  hi everyone i'm shaya i'm a 3d designer in chloe india office in this workshop i'll be explaining everything about creating a product packaging inside glue i'll be showing you how to fold the pattern to make the package and how to assign the fabric for creating the proper shape and we will also customize the material and graphic layout during the workshop you can ask any questions in the live set on the to start with i am going to import the layout design of the package make sure to check the option to auto trace internal lines internal lines would help us to fold the package once the pattern is ready here we can lay the pattern flat on the ground using the gizmo tool now let's fold this to make a box shape using the fold arrangement tool in the 3d window and we can just click on the internal lines and start folding it also be mindful of the right and wrong side of the pattern or material while folding it here i would do flip normal to reverse the sides so that once the package is folded the right side of the pattern would be on the outside part of the package and let's fold the other sides also one by one once the folding is done we can start sewing to secure the shape you can use the help of 3d window to see how you are sewing it let's fold the side of it too now i will select all the internal lines here and change the fold angles to 90 degree and then i will make the pattern material stiffer by changing the physical property of the fabric to trim hardware once that is complete i am going to change the particle distance from 20 to 5 and additional thickness collision to 1 in the property editor to refine the pattern now before simulating it i will also strengthen the pattern now if you look closer you can see the folded area doesn't look that smooth so i will change the mesh type to cord in the property editor the next step would be to fold the sides or flaps of the packages i will use the help of four 3d arrangement tool here once that is done i will secure the flaps with sewing you can check the direction of the sewing in the 3d window while sewing it and after that i will change the fold angles of the internal lines to 90 again here we are ready to simulate it once just simulated you can see the puffiness where you have sewn it so to change that i will select that survey and change the sewing line type to toned now let's see the inside view of the package i'm gonna unstrengthen it for a better view you can see the flash edges are not closed here so i will stick the flaps edges to the sides of the package i'll use the tag tool for attaching the flap let's attach all the sides after that i am gonna strengthen the box i prefer keeping the box strengthened while working it helps to keep the material stiff as you can see we have the basic package ready now as per your design you can customize the package too i'm going to stylize this design by adding a see-through material on the front side so that i will add an internal shape of a particular measurement and place it on the front side once i'm satisfied with the placement i'm gonna do cut into here and i'll create a different fabric here for the new pattern make sure the physical property of the new fabric is trim hardware now let's customize the fabrics i'm gonna change the colors of both the fabric and assign the second fabric to the cut and zone pattern after that i am going to change the opacity to 15 to make it transparent now i'm going to view the package from all the sites so that you can use our 3d tool called full 3d arrangement you can flip the package to see the other sides as well when you click on the full 3d garmin you will receive a pop-up box where you will be able to flip and rotate the box in the 3d window once that is done i am going to bring a car obj which is my product here after that i'll use gizmo tool to adjust the placement of the car now that i complete the process i will go to the render window and view how it looks there in the property editor you can change the render settings i have made the background transparent here i will also change the orientation of the image to landscape now to customize it further i am going to change the material type of the package to shiny you can see the shiny effect in real time i will change it to plastic now you can choose whichever material type you want from the drop down menu and see how it's looking in the interactive window now i'll change the material type to metal even after changing it you can customize the effect in the property editor you can adjust reflection intensity metalness etc in the property editor and create the look you want if you want to add a graphic layout on the package that can also be done easily for my convenience to apply graphics i have rotated the pattern and now all you need is the graphic in the form of pnga etc and using add graphics option you can import the graphics and place it on the pattern after that i will adjust the size in the property editor under the option graphic transformation then you can adjust the placement with the graphic transform tool now i will customize the color and the material type i'll also change the reflection intensity and then you can do the final render settings like background color light etc as per your wish and you can customize your render settings to achieve the final look thank you so much for watching we hope you have enjoyed this workshop and you were able to gain some new knowledge as well ",
        "Summary": "### Comprehensive Guide to Creating Product Packaging in Clo3D **Introduction** In this guide, we will walk you through the process of creating product packaging using Clo3D, a 3D garment visualization tool. This workshop is led by Shaya, a 3D designer at Chloe's India office, and will cover steps from importing layout designs to customizing materials and graphics for your package. --- ### Step-by-Step Instructions #### Step 1: Importing the Layout Design 1. **Open Clo3D** and navigate to the workspace. 2. **Import the layout design** of your package. Ensure you check the option for **\"Auto Trace Internal Lines.\"** This will help in folding the package correctly later on. #### Step 2: Laying Out the Pattern 1. Use the **Gizmo Tool** to lay the pattern flat on the ground. 2. Verify that the pattern's right side is facing up to avoid any errors when folding. #### Step 3: Folding the Package 1. Select the **Fold Arrangement Tool** in the 3D window. 2. Click on the internal lines to start folding the package into a box shape. 3. **Flip Normals** to reverse the sides if needed, ensuring that the right side of the pattern is on the outside. #### Step 4: Sewing the Package 1. After folding, use the sewing tool to secure the shape. 2. Check your sewing direction in the 3D window to ensure accuracy. 3. Fold the sides or flaps of the package using the **3D Arrangement Tool**. #### Step 5: Adjusting Fold Angles and Physical Properties 1. Select all internal lines and set the **Fold Angles** to 90 degrees. 2. Change the **Physical Property** of the fabric to **Trim Hardware** to make it stiffer. 3. Adjust **Particle Distance** from 20 to 5 and set **Additional Thickness Collision** to 1 in the property editor. #### Step 6: Refining the Pattern 1. Change the **Mesh Type** to **Cord** in the property editor for a smoother folded area. 2. Fold the sides or flaps using the 3D arrangement tool. 3. Use the sewing tool to secure the flaps. #### Step 7: Simulation 1. Once all sewing is done, simulate the package to see how it looks. 2. If the seams look puffy, change the sewing line type to **Toned**. #### Step 8: Finalizing the Package Structure 1. Unstrengthen the package slightly to view internal details. 2. Use the **Tag Tool** to attach flap edges to the sides of the package. 3. Strengthen the box again to maintain stiffness while working. --- ### Step 9: Customizing the Package 1. To add a see-through material, create an internal shape of specific dimensions and place it on the front side. 2. Use the **Cut Into** tool to define the new fabric. Ensure the new fabric's physical property is also **Trim Hardware**. 3. Change colors and assign a second fabric to the cut zone pattern. 4. Adjust the **Opacity** to 15 for transparency. #### Step 10: Viewing the Package 1. Use the **Full 3D Arrangement Tool** to view the package from all angles. 2. Check for any adjustments needed in placement or dimensions. --- ### Step 11: Adding Products 1. Import your product model (e.g., a car OBJ file). 2. Use the **Gizmo Tool** to position the product inside the package. #### Step 12: Rendering the Package 1. Navigate to the **Render Window** to see the final look of your package. 2. In the property editor, adjust the **Render Settings**: - Set background to **Transparent**. - Change image orientation to **Landscape**. #### Step 13: Material Customization 1.

        "Transcript": "  hi everyone i'm jeanette from co hong kong office thank you for watching this designer workshop so i have joined clothes since 2020 and as a designer in cloud i think creativity is always the key point to deal with the challenge so throughout the workshop today i hope you will know how 3d technology can advance our industry and also enjoy how to break through the boundaries with our creativity so i guess you already know what's the topic of today workshop so as you can see this plush tie here yup today we will go through the basic workflow of making clothesline in pro and also i will share some tips to create different light setting for the moody and energizing neon light scene so if you have any questions just feel free to use the live chat at the side and we will try to answer your questions there so let's start now so this is a semi-finished file i have prepared for the design workshop this time as you can see to make flush tie enclosed just like our basic workflow of making garments prepare the e pattern and avatar and apply sewing so once we have finished all those steps we just need to turn on simulation to check out the results and the flash charge shapes looks weird now so we just need to deactivate the avatar to relax the plush child shape in more natural smooths and i will also strengthen all the patterns and add pressure to the head and the body parts because it can help to emulate the plush toy shape after filled with stuffing materials and just turn on simulation to see the result yep so this part we also need to change the sewing eye type because you can see the seam line between height and body parts most stuff not natural so after i have created the base form of the cluster next i will use pin two okay to adjust the plush toy shape that close to my ideal shape so i would keep turning on simulation and use gizmo 2 to adjust the pin so as you can see i can adjust the shapes of the plush toy by using pen tool yeah i can even   draw down the pins here to make the plushter looks more cute so yeah anyway i think this is cute enough and yes of course the tails don't forget the tails so this is to chokes to use pin tool and this module to adjust the placement of the pattern or the placement of the shape of the posture so now i think it's good enough so i will freeze the head and the body patterns to maintain the plush toy shape and the years we will need to make it as a double layer so layer comb under and and later i will feel the pressure on that part so as we know the pressure setting is always positive on the upper layer pattern and set negative on the underlayer pattern because this setting can help us create the stuff that looks on both sides and yup don't forget some design details because i have designed some pattern as a design features on the earpods so i will trace out a pattern here and cancel it yep so finally we have finished the plush toy shape here and now we can move to the most interesting part which is apply different materials for the plush toy so in our clothes fabric menu the private editor here we can change different material type for our fabric for example a fur okay or silk that kind of fabric and of course you can build up your own materials library just like here i have created a lilac fabric before and you can see the setting here we can also do some specific setting for the fur and even we can choose different fur presets   and of course we can also change the fur parameters and also the first shape based on our needs   so once i change it you can only check the lighter color in 3d window so if you want to check out the full results we need to use our render entry so after i turn on the interactive render then you will see the full result now so for some details like the details on the ear parts and the tail so for that kind of design features i would like to apply nice materials on it so just to make it looks like a led decorated yeah here finish tonight and yeah it looks like a very edgy blush toy here great and yeah besides the fur texture and also the night texture you can also apply face fabric on the sole just like here and if i turn on render we can check the fabric texture in more details and realistic way great okay so next let's try to add some trim on it for example the eyes eyebrow nose okay i'll add those stream as say obj because they are the hot object in the scene so once i load the obj trim in flow i can use the crew tool to stick those obj on the pattern and of course we can also change the material type of the obj so here i would like to change it as a knight it looks like a led light okay and the other side i just need to simply copy and paste it and just paste them by the gizmo tool and stick it again and yeah also the eyes brows also i will add it as a trim and use the crew tool to stick on the pattern and the material type are plastic with butter here and also we can change the color of it and nose just do the same step just stick on it and change the color so for our color box here we can change any colors that we want by a web code or by painting code so we can change the color manually and yes also the strawberry i make it for this plush toy before and yeah maybe missed it it will go here but never mind i will just add it back and for that kind of graphic material we can also change the color and also the material type for example metal for it yup looks great here okay so now i will add top stitch on the mouth because i have already finished all those top rear trim so once we trace it the internal one here and then we can add top stitch here so we can also customize the top stitch in property editor like the top stitch offset and also the shape okay and yes of course the color so for some curved top stitch like here the mouth pounds i will also turn on the curved function so this function can help us smooth the top stitch shape and for the overlapping scene i will need to use the similar top stitch tool and also change the c offset to bring out the top stitch yeah if we don't change the c offsets the fur will cover the whole top stitch so here i will check the result on rendering again so far i think is good but only the eyes and the eyebrows parts may need to pull out a bit more because some fur are popped out on the eyes yeah the eyes looks good that the eyes brown we also need to yeah a little bit more because i don't want the fur part for the eyes bro so we need to check on render engine every time ensure the result is what we want and here i need to fix it again yeah so next i will add backdrop in the scene so i also prepare some neon light shade for my backdrop so here i just need to add it into my project and now if we go to the night setting i have turned off the dome light but after the ies and the spotlight so let's turn on the render first and see yeah i think it looks cool now the environment is styled and my songs mainly come from the spotlight and the ies knight okay so here as you can see for those led trim we just share the same material the normal fiber materials so for those nitro i will try to add some light materials on that yeah maybe i'll just add this green first and this is the one that i said before this is for the length okay materials in light and in green color and for the other one i will try to apply in other light materials but with different colors so the tips to create neon light in clothes make sure you have assigned different color amounts and tone of color on front side and front for example this blue neon light i use bright blue at side with 20 color modes and front i use the less saturated blue and higher kind of mount value because we know that the brightest part of the neon tube is the tube inside and kind of light will be reflected at side   yep looks fine so besides the night materials we can also set different light source in the scene as you can see there are many nice settings we can use from the weather engine here for example the rectangle knight spotlight etc so i will add a spare knight in the scene as an example here so once we added the span right here we can use this moto to adjust the light source placement just imagine this is a real spare knight in the scene and we can even change the intensity and also the color of the light and let's see   yes here you can see there's a nice shadow because uh i forgot to turn off the show setting i just need to turn it off which means uh only render the light but not render the light object okay so i can adjust the placement of the light here and also at the same time you can see some nice reflection on the ground in our render energy yeah looks great so now if i go to the next setting we can see the scene light source actually it comes from the spotlight ies 9 and also the spare knight and of course i will also adjust the finish conditions before i go ahead to the final render so i will change the night and the texture quality is very high and high because it contains the neon light and fur texture in the scene and also i will set a longer range time and less noise threshold for the final render yeah so this is the end of the designer workshop today hope you guys enjoy and see you next time ",

        "Transcript": "  hi everyone welcome to the claw user summit in 2022 we're very happy to have you here my name is cecil mcwa and i am thrilled to present the workshop how to create a denim button from scratch and clothe to you i am a 3d designer at grow virtual fashion and i am based in the european headquarter in munich germany my background is in fashion design i studied fashion design both menswear and women's wear with a focus on pattern making i have always been interested in new technologies and experimenting with different tools to see how to create and construct garments differently and this naturally led me to be interested in 3d technologies and then work at glow virtual fashion so if you have any questions throughout this workshop feel free to ask them in the chat we will make sure to give you an answer then let's get started and i hope you will enjoy following along the goal of this workshop is to demonstrate a complete workflow of creating a gene button from scratch in klow let's first have a look at what we are trying to achieve here is an example of the gene button that we will create and register in glo this idea was inspired by the different question asked by our users within our community forum regarding exporting a 3d objects from khloe using the uv editor for graphic and print placement as well as adding custom made button in clone in this workshop we will then share tips and tricks on modeling a heart object in cloud see how to use the uv editor mode in cloud to organize and extract the uvs of our object as well as see how to export a cloud project in a standard 3d file format and finally we will see how to register our object as a button in claw first let's start with modeling or seeing how to create the geometry of the button i will get started with the ellipse tool to create a circle in my 2d window i will select the tool and then click left once to generate a circle with a specific value i will select the option circumference and enter the value 125 comma 5 millimeters and then press ok we can see the geometry of our circle because it is a very small piece in order to make the mesh smaller i will then select my transform pattern tool to make the particle distance lower so then i have a higher resolution now you see that the edge of the circle has moved out i will then create three additional internal circles which will have different sizes i will then select my internal ellipse tool located in my 2d2 bar and then place my mouse at the center of the circle i will then click left once and again create an ellipse or this time an internal ellipse of a specific size i will go again to my circumference section and this time i will enter the value 106 comma 6 and then press ok i will repeat this a few times in order to create different rings so then i will create another one again selecting the circumference and then changing the value from 56 comma 3. and then the last one which i will do again and this time the circumference will be 37 comma 5 or 4 and then press ok so now i have my different rings i will then move my circles in the middle of my workspace in the 3d window i will select them in my 2d window like this and then use the gizmo to place them at the center once this is done we can select those internal lines in order to cut them and separate the rings i will start by selecting the interline of the center the one in the middle and then the last one i will then click right on one of those internal lines and then select the option cut and so now you see that each of those rings became distinct circles i will then reorganize them in my 2d window once this is done we will duplicate the two middle rings in order to create the bottom piece of the button i will select the two rings and copy paste them by using the shortcut ctrl c ctrl v i can align them to my original rings by pressing the shift key and following the y axis the good thing about aligning them in the 2d window when pasting them is that those two rings will also be aligned in the 3d window i will not need to adjust their x and y position in the 3d window only the set position i will then change the thickness rendering of all of those elements in order to create the thickness of our button i will get started with the outer ring and change the thickness rendering here to 2. i will then select the other ring on the left and change the thickness rendering to one i will move on to the ring located at the bottom on the far right and change the thickness rendering to three the top smaller ring here i will change the thickness rendering onto two and same for the smaller ring at the bottom and finally this circle here i will change the thickness rendering to 10. as you see when changing the thickness rendering the curvature of the geometry remains quite rounded in order to shave this extra surface off i will select all of those elements and then go to the property editor to change the curvature value of the curve side geometry which is set in percentage i will change this value from 100 to 10 percent the elements look now more appropriate for the project we are trying to achieve i will then move the z position of some of those rings in order to finalize the design i will select all of these elements and bring them above the ground this is important if we want to later on register our object as a button the distance from the ground to the button represents the distance from the garment to the button if the gap is too big between the ground and the object it might not be possible to register it as a button or the button will appear as it is floating and not attached to the garment once i am done i can save this object as the first draft by going into file save as project and saving it in a folder dedicated to this project we will then move on to the second chapter of this workshop and see how to organize the layout of the uvs within the uv editor mode let's now switch from simulation mode to uv editor mode generating a layout for the uvs will be important for this project as we will later want to apply a button texture which has specific graphic placement if for example we want to place this button texture on our object and no uvs have been set up we'll end up with this result it is not possible to add a graphic or change the position of a texture on an obj or any other 3d formatting glow using the edit texture tool and the transform graphic tool the uv editor will be then our best bet we will see later on what are the best obg export settings to make sure that our object geometry recognizes the uv layout that we will set up i will go back to my project file and organize the uvs into the uv editor i will keep the organization within the zero one square to save a single image which will then serve as a template to design the button surface texture i will scale the uvs up and spread them within the square zero one so that i'll optimize the amount of space used if i go beyond the square zero one i can click right within the empty space and select the option fit all uv to zero one i can then press ok to complete the action once the uvs are organized within the square zero one i can then export an image of the layout organization by clicking on the uv snapshot icon on the top right of the uv editor ui a pop-up window will appear and allow me to set up the saving path and change the resolution of the image if necessary in my case i will keep it to 2048 pixels i can also change the wire color of the mesh i will change the wire color from white to black so that i can clearly see the uvs and use the layout as a template in another 2d texture editing app to create the button texture surface finally a png has been saved in my gene button workshop folder and here is a preview of the image from that image i will then design the texture of my button in another 2d texture editing app in order to save time i did this step beforehand and here is the result i generated 3 images the texture map also more broadly known as color map the normal map and the roughness map i am now ready to go to the next step so then let's jump to the third chapter of this workshop and see what are the best export options for my object i decided to export the button as an obj depending on how and where this button will be used some other file format might make more sense but in my case i know that i will be able to register about an inklow from an obj file i will then go to file export obj then i will first define the saving path and the obj name and then a big pop-up window will appear i will make sure that all patterns are selected i will then export as a single object with the thickness for my obj to recognize the uv layout that i set up i will make sure to tick the unified uv coordinate option i will keep the image size to 2048 and keep my scales in millimeter finally i will select the option save with absolute image file path and then click ok then we can open a new window and import the button obj to see if everything is ok as you see it kept the position and size of my initial elements but now it is one single hard object there is no texture which is normal we will add the surface texture and the other maps that we generated from the uv layout after registering the button let's then directly jump into the following and last chapter i will be able to register a button include through the button tab of the object browser i will not go through the 3d window i can therefore remove this button obj from my workspace in the bottom tab i will select the default button and move towards the property editor i will reach the shape section and click on the little plus sign on the right side of the little button image a pop-up window will appear and allow me to register the obj that i saved as a clone button it will then be converted into the btn file format which is a clone native file format i will first name my button file and then select an image which i can use as a thumbnail it can be a picture of a real life button or an illustration in my case i will select an illustration for this workshop i will not set up different button sizes so i will omit this section underneath the button title i will jump directly to the obj section and load my obj file by clicking on the four square icon i will keep the value of the width thickness and weight as it is it will then resize my button accordingly later on it will still be possible to change the width thickness and weight of the button in the property editor once i am done i can press ok and then the button will be registered you can see now that the button has been added inside the object browser and it has replaced the default button here you can also see in the property editor that the button has been added inside the shape library section and now you will be able to use it for other project as well but before that let's add a texture normal and roughness map and then save this new button to override the initial one so that when you use it for other projects then the button will be complete with the visual aspect as well i would then go here to add my texture and select this texture that we created beforehand then click on open i will do the same as i generated some normal maps and roughness map from this texture and add them so i select my normal map and then i will change from roughness intensity into map and select the map section and select my map and click on open to make sure that everything is alright i will add it onto a small pattern piece i will create this pattern piece using the rectangle tool right here i will create a rectangle like this i can make it a little bit bigger as such and then i will add a button using the button tool so i select the button tool and i can add a button either on inside the 2d on the 3d window so here and it seems to be okay so if it is okay then we can go back into our object browser into the button tab and select our button i can then go into my property editor all the way up and click on the save button here and then i can overwrite the button that i initially created so that it also has the textures so here we go this is the full workflow of creating a button from scratch include and then registering it in our system then to finalize this workshop video i will show you how the button looks like on a final garment i will go into file open project and i will select this denim jacket final that i created beforehand and here we go here is final button that has been applied onto a denim jacket i will zoom in so that you can have a better look so thank you all for joining me today i hope you enjoyed this workshop and that you are able to learn something new feel free to check out other design workshops and presentation throughout the day i wish you a good summit and see you soon ",

        "Transcript": "  hello everyone i am benita a 3d designer from the khloe india office and in this workshop we will be learning about a few different quilting techniques on some home products   so to begin we are going to go ahead and create a quilt to start with i'm going to create a pattern over here so using my rectangle pattern tool you can set the width and height to whatever you want your query to be at so here i'm just adding a couple of values that i've worked out before and now i have my quilt pattern ready once this is done i'm just placing it in the right position because i'm going to simulate it right here on this sofa so i'm just making sure that the position of my pattern is correct just before i simulate it okay now that i have my quilt simulated i'm gonna go ahead and start the process of creating the quilting effect to do that i'm creating an internal rectangle and i'm going to create a couple of them so a small rectangle and i'm going to copy paste this so first copy pasting it along the length of the pattern and here you can customize this to any number of shapes that you want and change the interval between them as well once this is done of course i need the same squares the same internal squares to come below so again a simple copy paste and when i right click i get the option to set an interval and increase the number of shapes as well so here i have my internal shapes that are spread out on my quilt once this is done we're going to layer clone over and the reason we're doing this is because we're going to add pressure between them so we need two layers of the quilt now i'm going to go ahead and change the pressure so one thing to remember here will be the pattern on the top that is the layer clone over will be a positive pressure and the pattern at the bottom will be a negative pressure when you simulate you will see automatically you will have pressure filled between the pattern and you will get a quilt this again can be adjusted so you can adjust the amount of pressure that is between both the patterns you can also adjust the internal shapes after they are created so in case you feel that you need a little more space or you need the shapes to be a little smaller you can make those changes right now as well i'm just pulling and adjusting my quilt so it sits correctly the way i want it to and once this is done i'm going to select these patterns and i'm going to set a fabric to them because right now they're set to a default fabric i have a fabric ready here in the library so i'm just setting it to that fabric and once this is done you have your quilt ready to go now we're moving on to the second part of our workshop and here we're gonna go ahead and create the quilted pillow to start with as always i'm going to create a pattern for my pillow so the rectangular pattern tool and again you can customize the size of this pillow to whatever value you like once this is done again i am going to place this pillow pattern exactly where i want it to be once this is done let's simulate it and i'm just going to change the position a little bit once this is done i am just offsetting as an internal line for the pillow and this is just to give it a better look once i have the pillar offsetted i'm just going to increase the size a bit and once this is done i am going to now layer clone it so again you can choose the option of layer clone over or under this time i am going to choose the option of layer clone under once i have both layers of the pillow you can see the bottom layer is actually facing downwards i'm setting it to textured surface and so to make sure they face each other i'm just choosing the option of flip normal this means you have the right side of the fabric facing outward once this is done simulated and of course now we are going to change the pressure to create the pillow effect so this time i can set a positive pressure to both the pattern since the right side of the fabric is facing outward and once you simulate your pillow will look something like this once this is done now we are going to select the patterns and i'm going to remove the linked editing now that this is done to create a different quilted effect here i am using the internal lines to go ahead and create this you can use internal shapes or any pattern that you would like the pillow to be embossed with so i'm just merging both the copies that i have created so that it is one arc once i have this arc created i'm just adjusting it so it sits in the middle and now i'm going to offset it you can set whatever distance you would like and as many number of offsets i'm trying to create a sort of rainbow pattern over here now that my internal lines are here i'm just making sure my curved internal lines end at the internal line that is on the all four sides of my pattern and once this is done we are now going to create the second layer to do that a simple layer clone over so here you have two layers now and i'm going to do the same for the bottom as well because if i don't do it you will see the pillow will now move upward so we have to make sure to layer clone the bottom one as well once you have the bottom layer i'm simulating and you'll see your pillow will sit properly once you have all of this ready i am now going to create the quilted effect to do that we are using additional thickness collision so i am setting the value to 8 from the regular 2.5 and you can see you get a slightly quilted effect to get a better look i'm changing it to a little bit higher and changing it to thick textured surface i'm also just placing the pillow where i need it to be and we will refine this as well once i'm happy with the placement of the pillow let's work on refining it so here i am selecting the top patterns and i'm changing the particle distance to five this will give me a much better quilted look that i want once i'm happy with the look i'm just going to change the fabric now so i'm just changing the color here i'm going to choose the picker tool to pick a color from the same pattern of my quilt and once this is done just click ok and you have your embossed pillow ready to go so here i have an illustrator file and i'm going to get this illustrator file as a quilted pattern into clone so this will be added as internal lines and i'm making sure i have a border around here because that will be the size of my pattern just making sure the file is clean and we're going to add this illustrator file into clone once this is done i am adding it to my library and all i am going to do is right click and add to workspace in clo and import as internal shapes you can see my file has been added into chloe and the pattern that was on the illustrator file has now been added in as internal lines i'm increasing the size and adjusting it a little bit you can change the size the dimensions you can even change the internal shape after that if you'd like here i'm just placing it as before before simulation and once i'm happy with the adjustment i am going to layer clone it once you have both the layers present i'm going to flip normal the back layer so we have both the right side of the fabric facing outward and once this is done we add pressure to create my pillow just before i simulate it i'm also going to remove the linked editing between both the patterns and i'm going to remove the internal lines pattern from the bottom layer because i don't need it at the bottom so select the internal lines and delete it and once this is done i'm just checking the pressure and we're going to go ahead and simulate it so here you have the pillow with the exact pattern that you wanted once this is simulated properly i'm going to go ahead and create the top quilted layer to do that a simple layer clone over and we're going to do one for the other pattern as well so that the pressure is equal once this is done go ahead and simulate and let it adjust here we are going to create the quilted effect to create that we select the top patterns and like before we are going to change the additional thickness collision so here it is a default of 2.5 i'm changing it to 12 and we go ahead and simulate don't worry if the look is not exactly what you wanted to be we are going to refine this as well so again selecting the patterns and we're going to change the particle distance to five now when you simulate you'll see you'll get a much better look once this is done again just changing the color to whatever you would like it to be you can also change the fabric during this time to whichever fabric you would like your pillow to be added at you can also have different fabric for different layers now i'm just going to go ahead and take off the internal lines and here you can see the quilted effect a lot clearer now i'm just going to remove my library and show you the 3d screen and this is what your different quilted techniques will look like thank you everyone for watching this video i hope you found this tutorial useful and enjoy the rest of the workshop ",
        "Summary": "# Comprehensive Guide to Quilting Techniques in 3D Design In this guide, we will cover the quilting techniques demonstrated by Benita, a 3D designer, in her workshop. This guide provides step-by-step instructions, definitions, tips, and tricks to help you create quilted patterns for home products using design software like Clo3D. ## Workshop Overview ### Objective Learn various quilting techniques to create quilted patterns for home products, specifically focusing on quilts and pillows. ### Prerequisites - Basic familiarity with 3D design software (e.g., Clo3D). - Understanding of design tools and terminology such as patterns, layers, and pressure settings. --- ## Part 1: Creating a Quilt ### Step 1: Create the Quilt Pattern 1. **Select the Rectangle Pattern Tool**: Use this tool to create a basic quilt pattern. 2. **Set Dimensions**: Input your desired width and height for the quilt. 3. **Position the Pattern**: Place the quilt pattern where you want it to appear (e.g., on a sofa). ### Step 2: Simulate the Quilt - Go to the simulation option to visualize your quilt pattern on the selected surface. ### Step 3: Create Internal Rectangles 1. **Create Internal Rectangles**: Use the rectangle tool to create smaller rectangles for quilting effects. 2. **Copy and Paste**: Duplicate the internal rectangles along the length of the quilt pattern. 3. **Set Intervals**: Right-click to adjust intervals and increase the number of internal rectangles. ### Step 4: Layer Cloning 1. **Layer Clone**: Use the layer clone function to duplicate the quilt pattern. This will create two layers. 2. **Adjust Pressure**: - Set positive pressure for the top layer (layer clone). - Set negative pressure for the bottom layer. 3. **Simulate**: Run the simulation to see the quilt effect. ### Tips for Adjustment - You can adjust the internal shapes after creating them if you need more space or smaller shapes. - Fine-tune the pressure settings to achieve the desired quilt look. ### Step 5: Apply Fabric 1. **Select Patterns**: Highlight the quilt patterns. 2. **Choose Fabric from Library**: Set the fabric for both layers from your fabric library. --- ## Part 2: Creating a Quilted Pillow ### Step 1: Create the Pillow Pattern 1. **Use Rectangle Pattern Tool**: Create a rectangle for your pillow, customizing the size as needed. 2. **Position the Pillow**: Ensure the pillow pattern is correctly positioned. ### Step 2: Simulate the Pillow - Run the simulation to visualize the pillow. ### Step 3: Create Internal Lines 1. **Offset Internal Lines**: Create an offset line for better aesthetics. 2. **Layer Clone**: Clone the pillow pattern, selecting \"Layer Clone Under\" this time. ### Step 4: Flip Normals - To ensure the right side of the fabric is facing outward, choose the option to flip normals for the bottom layer. ### Step 5: Set Pressure for the Pillow 1. **Adjust Pressure Settings**: Set positive pressure for both layers. 2. **Simulate**: Run the simulation again to visualize the pillow with the quilted effect. ### Step 6: Create Embossed Effect 1. **Use Internal Lines**: Create additional internal lines to achieve an embossed look. 2. **Merge Copies**: Combine copies of your internal lines to form a cohesive arc shape. 3. **Offset Internal Lines**: Adjust the distance for the embroidery effect. ### Step 7: Layer Clone and Pressure 1. **Layer Clone**: Duplicate the pillow layers to ensure balance. 2. **Simulate**: Check the placement again and simulate. ### Tips for Refining - Change the additional thickness collision value to create a more pronounced quilted effect. - Adjust the particle distance to refine the overall look. --- ## Part 3: Importing Illustrator Files ### Step 1: Prepare Illustrator File 1. **Ensure Clean File**: Make sure your Illustrator file has a border defining the pattern size. 2. **Import into Clo3D**: Right-click and add the file to your workspace, choosing to import as internal shapes. ### Step 2: Adjust Imported Pattern 1. **Resize and Position**: Adjust the size and position of the imported pattern. 2. **Layer Clone**: Clone the layers as necessary. ### Step 3: Apply Final Adjustments 1. **Check Pressure Settings**: Ensure your pressure settings are correct. 2. **Simulate**: Run a final simulation to visualize the completed quilted effect on your pillow. ### Step 4: Customize Fabric - Change the fabric and color to your desired selections for the final look. ### Final Touch - Remove any unnecessary internal lines from the bottom layer for clarity in the final design. --- ## Conclusion By following the instructions outlined in this guide, you should be able to effectively create quilted designs for various home products using 3D design software. Remember to experiment with different patterns, pressures, and fabrics to achieve unique results. Enjoy your creative process and happy designing!"

        "Transcript": "  hi everyone my name is fernanda i'm a 3d designer in the munich office and it's a pleasure to be here at the virtual user summit in this workshop you'll learn how to prepare your cloud 3d files when exporting to virtual augmented reality i'll show you some tips on how to optimize your files and we'll go through the export settings and understand which kind of file formats you should choose when exporting to vr and ar in order to get a great result on your project hope you enjoy it feel free right on the chat if you have any questions and i'll start now by sharing my screen when it comes to vr and ar the file size becomes an important factor especially when exporting to ar the file size should be the smallest possible and one way to achieve this is by reducing the number of polygons so ideally you should have all your patterns with a particle distance of 20 but in case you still need to have some of them with a smaller particle distance in order to show better the details then you should evaluate which patterns can be changed here in my case these leaves depends and the back of my garments can easily have a particle distance of 20. now the neck and the curse patterns i prefer keeping on a lower particle distance to get better details at this moment what i can also do is to change the mesh type by default the meshes in claw are always triangles but we can change them to quad on patterns that have mostly straight angles to change that you have to select the patterns and go straight down to miscellaneous in the property editor and here you can find mesh type in my project i will change the mesh type to quad on the patterns from the sleeves from the pens that have mostly straight angles and that wouldn't be too compromised if i change them to quad i can always simulate to confirm if these changes not harming my final design idea and notice that when i change the mesh to quad the number of words is false indicating that my file size will be smaller another efficient way to reduce the size of your file is by changing the type of top stitching by default top stitches in claw are objs which means that they are geometry files in order to look more realistic but you can change the top stitches to texture instead of geometry and it will reduce considerably the size of your file to do that click on your top stitch in the object browser and go to type where you can choose between obj and texture let's see these two t-shirts the one in the left was exported with its top stitch set as a texture and the one in the right as an obj of course the obj top stitch has much more resolution than the texture top stitch but let's compare the size of their file the one with obj has more or less 33 megabytes whereas the one with texture has 7 megabytes almost 5 times smaller next step is to bake the textures vr and ar environments demand high performance and minimal visual lag so baking is fundamental as it will simplify complex surface effects i've baked my textures previously as it can be a little time consuming and will go over with this file now if you want to know more on how to bake your textures check out our tutorial on youtube how to bake texture maps once this is done it is time to export a file so let's move on to understanding the different kinds of file formats and its export settings when exporting your garments to virtual augmented reality prefer using fbx gltf or glb file formats because they are capable of holding a variety of data such as mesh uv animation rigs etc obj is a much simpler file format it supports only the mesh simple materials and uvs so let's start by getting familiar with fbx and its settings fbx is one of the most popular file formats used in 3d editors game engines films vr and ar it easily exchanged data between applications and after being exported can still be edited however fbx has two major downsides firstly it is a closed format meaning that you need a system supported by sdk to use it it is not supported by a web browser for instance secondly the lighting models stored by fbx file have not evolved as 3d editors and game engines which utilizes complex shader networks and bpr approaches in other words it becomes a limitation for garments with reflections metallics etc what happens most of the time is that after importing to your desired application the materials still have to be fixed or even redone so i will go ahead and export my file as an fbx and let's see the export settings now the first thing you have to decide is whether you'd like to export with or without an avatar in my case i prefer exporting the garment only so i will not be selecting this option but note that here you can also exclude the freak in case you want to next it asks if you prefer having it single or multiple objects the best way to understand the difference between them is by seeing its final result so i have prepared this file with both garments exported as fbx the one in the left was exported as a single object whereas the one in the right was exported as a multiple object so let's see the difference between them when choosing single the garment becomes an unique object on the other hand when choosing multiple the garment keeps its pattern separated so i can select them individually as i am doing right now next is the texture surface if you want to apply the additional thickness you've added your 3d then choose thick and this also helps your garments to look more realistic if you choose thin any additional thickness will be added and the final result will look as thin as a paper further we have the unified uvs let's take this box as we want to export it with the textures that we have baked and here you can define the image size just remember that higher numbers increase the file size if you have an animation this option will be available remember to take it in case you want to export it as well when we come to basic let's leave the file type as binary a binary file is only readable by programs ascii file on the other hand is made of human readable text which means that it can be opened and added as a document if you don't need it as a text then save it as a binary as it will take up less space as i mentioned previously fbx needs a system supported by sdk here you can choose its version i'll go ahead and save it with the most updated one finally let's keep the texture as embedded media and hit ok if fbx has limitations regarding materials representation dltf and glb on the other hand read bpr materials offering a much better result these file formats are widely used for ar and vr also differently from fbx they are open source files that can be used in native web applications by comparison they are known as the jpeg of the 3d world now the difference between them is that gltf stores its information json file format while glb stores information in a binary file format like fbx resulting in compact file sizes and fast loading time the export settings are very similar to fbx but let's have a quick look at it on the first part of the export settings you can select what you want to export the patterns the avatar graphics and trims just as i did in fbx i will export only the garment without the avatar next we already saw the difference when choosing single or multiple objects as well as thin or thick and also the unified uv coordinates when it comes to option ticking light will not make a difference as i don't have any additional light on my 3d you can leave the default settings for basic and in x's conversion make sure that y is as up so you get the model in the right direction i will choose save as embedded but will not need to zip either xml so i'll not choose those the single difference from when exporting sglp is that you don't have the option to end bad files and the rest of the settings is absolutely the same now that we have exported the same file as fbx and gltf let's compare their size i have previously exported the same file as glp so we can compare all the three of them together comparing glb and gltf glb is 6 megabytes smaller and fbx ended up also with a smaller size and now let's compare their final result and see how they look when imported as fbx gop and gltf i have imported them back to claw you can see that on my 2d window we only have the silhouette of the avatar and the little flags that i created to label each file at first they look quite similar but when we look to the back of the garment where i have metallic and transparent material glb and gltf represent much better the original file in conclusion if you need to edit the files using different 3d softwares then fbx might be the right file format for you however remember that after exporting you might need to edit or even redo the materials of your 3d now if you want to transmit your 3d efficiently over the internet with more precise materials you should opt for gltf or glb remembering that glb offers a smaller file size so for these reasons i'll choose to export my file as glb just one little last tip some game engines require you to add a plugin in order to be able to import a file as gltf so here is my final file exported as glb and ready to be imported to a vr platform in the background is the store display created by my colleague damar if you haven't checked out her workshop on how to create a store display i highly recommend you to watch it as well as the other amazing content that we have prepared for you you have enjoyed this workshop and thank you for

        "Summary": "### Comprehensive Guide to Preparing Cloud 3D Files for Virtual and Augmented Reality **Workshop Overview:** In this workshop, Fernanda, a 3D designer from Munich, provides a step-by-step guide on how to prepare 3D files for export to Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR). The focus is on optimizing file sizes and choosing appropriate file formats to achieve successful results in VR and AR projects. --- ### Step-by-Step Instructions #### 1. Understand the Importance of File Size - **Key Point:** When exporting for AR and VR, keep the file size as small as possible to ensure high performance and minimal visual lag. - **Action:** Aim for a particle distance of 20 for patterns, adjusting only when necessary for detail. #### 2. Adjust Particle Distance - **Definition:** Particle distance refers to the resolution of the patterns in your design. - **Tip:** Identify which patterns can maintain a particle distance of 20 without losing essential detail (e.g., leaves, backs of garments). - **Action:** Keep patterns requiring more detail (e.g., necklines) at a lower particle distance. #### 3. Change Mesh Type - **Definition:** Mesh type refers to how polygons are represented (triangles vs. quads). - **Tip:** Use quads for patterns with mostly straight angles to reduce file size. - **Action:** - Select the patterns. - Navigate to the “Miscellaneous” section in the property editor. - Change mesh type from triangles to quads where applicable. #### 4. Optimize Top Stitching - **Definition:** Top stitches can be represented as geometry (OBJ) or as textures. - **Tip:** Changing to texture reduces file size significantly. - **Action:** - Select top stitch in the object browser. - Change the type from OBJ to texture. - Compare file sizes (OBJ is around 33 MB; texture is around 7 MB). #### 5. Bake Textures - **Definition:** Baking textures simplifies complex surface effects, crucial for AR and VR environments. - **Tip:** Baking can be time-consuming; consider reviewing a tutorial on YouTube for guidance. - **Action:** Ensure textures are baked before exporting. #### 6. Choose the Right File Format - **Preferred Formats:** - **FBX:** Suitable for 3D editors and game engines but has limitations in material representation. - **GLTF/GLB:** Open-source formats that better represent materials and are optimized for the web. #### 7. Export Settings for FBX - **Action:** - Decide whether to include the avatar. - Choose between exporting as a single or multiple objects (single creates one object, multiple keeps patterns separate). - Select 'thick' for realistic appearance, or 'thin' for a paper-like finish. - Enable unified UVs for texture export and set image size (note: higher sizes increase file size). - Save as a binary file for a smaller size. #### 8. Export Settings for GLTF/GLB - **Action:** - Similar to FBX, select what to export (garments only). - Choose between single or multiple objects, and thickness. - Set the Y-axis to ‘up’ to maintain correct orientation. - Save as embedded media without zipping or XML. #### 9. Compare File Sizes - **Action:** After exporting, compare sizes of FBX, GLTF, and GLB files to ensure optimal selection. #### 10. Import and Review - **Action:** Import the exported files back into your 3D design software to check for accuracy and quality, especially in areas with complex materials. --- ### Conclusion and Recommendations - **When to Use FBX:** If you need to edit files in different 3D software applications and don’t mind redoing materials. - **When to Use GLTF/GLB:** For efficient internet transmission with precise materials; GLB is preferred for its smaller file size. - **Final Tip:** Verify if your game engine requires a plugin for GLTF files. --- ### Additional Resources - **Tutorial on Baking Textures:** Look for video tutorials on platforms like YouTube for detailed instructions. - **Workshop Recommendations:** Consider checking out other workshops related to VR/AR design for more insights. **Thank you for participating in this workshop, and happy designing!**"

        "Transcript": "hi everyone for this session we'll download the free items from connect store and create a lookbook and the session will be in three parts download items create a logbook and unload and sell before we download the free items from connect store let me give you a brief demo of how to use connect first let's go to connect connect Is An Open Marketplace for Khloe and Marvelous Designer where you can buy and sell digital assets click the sign in button to log in with your account if you don't have the user ID you can also use a co-user ID to sign up after you log in you'll find the main page of connect if you look into curators pick on the main page you will find the selected works of other users clicking on the image will direct you to the detailed page where you can comment or like the items created by others when you click on the profile picture it will direct you to the portfolio page of the user with other collections of their own also you can simply click on the Creator tab on the top menu to search for other creators as you can see connect is where you may fully use it as your portfolio space and as a community where you can communicate with users all over the world now let's go to this store by clicking on the store tab on the top menu if you Mouse over to the storage Hub you'll find four categories Garmin fabric trim and Avatar if you just click on the sword tab you can see all the items regardless of category and if you do not set up any filters free view only and paid items will be exposed at once you can set options and prices in the pricing option menu and if you click on the check box for physical production it will only show the garments and patterns that are eligible for physical production additionally please use the sort by feature to view items by setting filters such as price and date next let's take a look at the diagram above which summarizes the concept of an original item a unique feature of connect the original item refers to the initial item used for the other items that protect the rights of the original creators items uploaded to connect when I'm loading it to connect we provide a tracking system code where you can find your items used on the other items or vice versa suppose the item contains an original item sold as a paid item in that case the original item's price is automatically added to the total and the original creators will earn loyalties when selling their items please note that you must sell the items containing the original items at a higher price than the original items here is an example for a clear understanding of how it works this dress was created as a chain dress using chains purchased in Connect store if the Creator used the item from the original Creator to create a new item as second creation it would have the original item tag in the related items section and you will find the chain used in the dress now let's click on the original item if you look at this chain which is an original item you will find the chain dress as a derived item this way connect protects the user's item as an original item and distributes the revenue preventing the Creations from spreading indiscriminately next I'll show you how to purchase items in the store items can be both purchased in Connect website and close software first I'm going to purchase items on connect website click on the connect icon at the top left corner and it will direct you to the main page of the connect now select the items you prefer and the top free item section on the main page I'll choose this one if you click on the item the item page will appear then click the add to cart button on the right and prepare for checkout next go to your cart now enter your billing address in English then check the boss for connect terms of service and choose either stripe or PayPal to purchase the item then it will direct you to your purchase page and you'll be able to download the item this file will be saved to your computer now let's see how we can use connecting clue first start close software when you open the close software on the left side you'll find the library window then click on the connect tab on the far right when you click on the connect icon you'll see the two icons in the top right corner the account icon can connect your existing closed set account with Cloud software now click on the account icon and click add account to log into your closet account this will link your closed set account and close software so that the item you previously downloaded on connect will appear and you can download it again on closed software then you'll find another connect icon on the right side of the account icon when you click on it it will direct you to the main page of connect website next I'll go through each category on connect topic new is where you can find the recently uploaded items in Garmin fabric trim and Avatar is where you can find each item based on the category last but not least my item is where you can view all the items you have downloaded with your account you'll be able to find the item you just downloaded here is where you can see all the item list you may search for the items you like check free to see free items and double-click to load the items right away to your 3D window please note that you cannot directly load the paid items but if you click on the paid items from the list it will direct you to the payment page of connect here is the difference between the two ways of purchasing items so when you purchase the items directly on the connect Store where the purchase process actually happens the items will be downloaded and saved on your computer while purchasing items in close software which skips all the purchase process it is not downloading and saving items but just loading the items in the 3D window of close software now let's dive into the actual process of creating a lookbook to download the materials you need click on the Creator tab on the top menu bar now you'll be able to find the connect official account on the very top if you go into the connect official page you'll see the collection list then you'll find the collection section under the collection list if you Mouse over to the connect official block a line address you'll see the shopping cart icon on the right side of the image by clicking this you will be able to purchase the item without going into the item page now before we make a final purchase let's find other materials we need and add them to the cart first let's find the Avatar please find an avatar called fv2 una02 with a high bun and add it to your shopping cart as we did with the a-line dress Mouse over to the image and click the shopping cart to add it to your cart next just below the Avatar you'll find the hair collection add the item of hair behind the ears named fv2 bob02 once you successfully added the hair to your cart please find the pose fv2 Collections and add one of the poses you like lastly if you scroll down a bit you'll find the shoe collections please note that shoes are not compatible with different gender so you need to check the item name for the Avatar you are going to use since we're using a female Avatar please add the shoes of your preference that start with fv2 okay now let's find the lighting and backgrounds under the scene in props collection select stage 001 with a bright background this item has all the background and lighting for rendering click on the item and click the add to cart button on the right side of the item page currently seen in profiles offer Z project file format it is because it doesn't have a suitable file format or category for CNN Prof files therefore this file cannot be protected as an original item for second creation however we are currently developing the file formatting category for scene improp files so you'll be able to sell purchase and protect them as an original items next let's find trims to add a little touch to the Garment let's go back to the collection list page to get the trims you like I'll add the sequence and rhinestones to my shopping cart now it's time for free Fabrics go to store and click on the fabric category to download the free fabric if you check free on the pricing options you will filter all the free Fabrics once you are geared up with all the items you need let's go into the final purchase by clicking on the shopping cart icon at the top right corner please check if all items are in your cart such as Avatar hair pose and shoes then please click the check box to agree to connect terms of service then choose either stripe or PayPal to make a purchase once you purchase you will direct to the purchase page and click on the download button to download the item you have purchased all the downloaded files will be saved onto your computer so this is the end of a brief introduction to connect and shopping all the materials you need for creating a lookbook now let's move on to the next part to create a lookbook please continue with the next tutorial video ",

        "Transcript": "  hello everyone here is olg from claw europe welcome to this tailoring workshop i really enjoy proper blazer and today i'm going to show you how to create one in claw we are going to learn about digital craftmanship for tailoring while creating a beautiful blazer if you have your own pattern please upload it and sew the lining and the shell separately if you don't have a pattern we have you covered with the modular configurator and its block library so let's start let's see how you can use a blazer from mongolia configurator click here men jackets double breasted or single breasted is a difficult choice but let's go for the double one here you can choose between different lapels designed as well as vents and sleeves just double click on the option you like if you want to delete a modular frame go to modular select the frame and then press delete then you can return to the simulation mode to adjust the pattern for those of you who used your own patterns please arrange and sew your pattern pieces here this was already done if you have bends you would need to fold them inside with the help of arrangement tool move one arrow but keep a bit of distance between them don't forget to minimalize the fold angle and activate the fold rendering also you need to add a sewing connection here sewing line type turned as well as on the top of the vent it should be also turned you can see it very well in the 3d window and then you can simulate please pay attention that the front is sewing together on the hem you usually add around three centimeters to fold them to inside for a real word blazer you would also have a seam allowance on top but in claw we work without any seam allowance however here we would like to add those three centimeters of fabric that will work as a facing right click on the line here offset pattern outline 30 millimeters and check create internal line here the right choice would be mirror but it's not possible so we'll go with perpendicular for other pattern pieces i can actually use mirror and here again it would not be possible so i go with perpendicular and i also need to change the setting of the angle to the second one and we should add some sewing connections then we can fold this pad later on now so let's do it now it's the same as this event fault arrangement tool don't bring two arrows together too close if it would be a circle it would be around five minute difference and don't forget to minimalize the angle and activate the fault rendering for each line and then we can simulate i usually hide avatar and look from inside if some sewing connections are still missing for example this one so inline type should be turned and this one i'm just looking at the 3d window to see what i'm doing with free sewing to fix the position of the facing for a 3d blazer i recommend creating an internal line with offset of the facing height so here it is 30 millimeters from the hem then make sure that these lines go till the pattern ages and then you can sew the hem of the facings to these lines for physical blazers we usually don't sew the facing to the blazer however if you work on a virtual jacket it's very helpful to prevent the facing from folding by doing it now we are done with this layer so we can select it right click deactivate and height 3d pattern now we can show the lining and activate it here we also have a fold and we would need to remove linked editing to fold just one side here i already have all sewing connections and those that should be turned are turned i also make sure that this pattern piece are on top of the other one and then we can simulate to prepare it for further layering i'm going to make it smaller so i'm going to use shrinkage weft and set this parameter to 85 now this layer is much smaller and i can freeze it then we bring back the shell so we show it and activate it the next step would be to set this layer to layer 1. so if you're instructing it you will see that this color is changed to green and once you simulate you see that this layer comes on top of the lining and i prefer to keep this layer on strengthen then we can unfreeze the lining simulate and step by step return the shrinkage wave to 100 while still simulating and the last step here select the shell and return its layer to layer 0. after that we can start sewing the lining and the shell together make sure you delete the sewing connection at the center of the lining of the shell otherwise you will get overlapping sewing connection and then segment by segment you can connect the lining and the shell together and make sure to use sewing line type custom angle i prefer to do it at the end when i created all sewing connections it's always useful to simulate in between to make sure that you did everything right let's look at site here a lining of a physical blazer would usually have a little fault for a digital blazer it would add unnecessary complication so let's cut out the length of this fold to make our 3d model more stable right click offset button outline retract 30 millimeters as you can see now the lengths as much let's correct the sewing connection for example here on the front facing we would need to reduce the length on the one side and to add a little sewing connection to connect the front facing and the main pattern piece here and then we can use segment sewing to connect the lining with the shell here the sewing line type stays as custom angle here i forgot to retract so right click offset button i outline retract and it's a last sewing connection then from the inside i also see that i need to connect the lining with the vent i'm looking for pattern outlines without showing connections and connecting them their sewing line type should be turned it's always good to simulate to check if the sewing connections are right let's go further and add shoulder pads usually i change the pose to a for size pose but because this blaze is double breasted i would actually prefer to keep it as a pose basically the problem can occur here so we kept it as a pose we are going to use standard shoulder pads from the library hardware and trims shoulder pads male 4 millimeters right click add to workspace it's important to choose add and not to open here we go you can hide other pattern pieces to check the position of the shoulder pads on the avatar i also prefer to solidify the shoulder pads now let's sew them to the shell it's helpful to show one of the front shell pattern pieces to know how to distribute the sewing connection between the front and the back i'm using free sewing so i connect one side to the front sewing line type should be turned and then the other side of the shoulder pad to the back of the lining it should be turned as well the next step is to assign layers i set all front and all back pattern pieces of the line to layer minus one here and all front and all back pattern pieces of the shell to layer one the shoulder pads are going to stay in between because they're on the layer 0. i recommend to keep all sleeve pattern pieces on the layer 0 as well to make this a bit dangerous simulation even more safe let's freeze all pattern pieces under the arm and on the side of the body then once we simulate the shelter parts are going to find their way between the shell and the lining don't simulate too long sometimes it causes some issues then simply set everything back to layer 0 and simulate again as you can see now all issues are solved and the shoulder parts are perfectly placed where they should be the secret of those shoulder pads is that each part of it has additional thickness collision that works like a usual shoulder pad thickness in millimeter if you want you can increase or decrease this parameter let's create a sleep head there is a fast workflow with creating a thin rectangle pattern piece but i prefer to trace a pattern piece in the shape of the sleeve on top it will look nicer i use internal polygon line to create a line now it looks fine also to make sure that this line intersects with pattern outlines i'm using extend trim to pattern outline let the mesh redrape by simulating now you can trace it as a pattern piece and assign the fabric of shoulder pads then you need to sew it don't forget to turn this seam and of course you need two of those and in 3d you can perfectly use superimpose under in reality you would not have a sewing connection on the internal line but here i actually prefer to keep this sewing connection but i will just hide it by setting its normal map intensity and thickness to zero so you don't see it in the 3d then simulate to see the changes in the drape this pattern piece has quite high particle distance at the moment so let's say set it to 5 and also change additional thickness collision to a higher number let's continue with another construction feature interlining i don't need strengthen here in claw if you select a pattern piece you can add interlining to it by checking bond in the property editor it makes the trap of this pattern piece stiffer you can also select between different presets of bond for my blazer i would like to use reinforcement it's even stiffer in tailoring we usually add interlining to fronts and to front facings as well as colors and color stands then we also need to add some interlining to the hem of the sleeve as well as back pattern pieces so here in this case i will simply select these lines and activate sim taping in the property editor you can increase its feeds so it would be the same bond with the same presets also we need to add it here same taping for this pattern piece the shape should be special that's why we are going to use internal polygon line to create the shape for the interfacing i recommend you not to create internal lines on top of the pattern outlines by but create them a bit on the outside of the pattern piece once the shape is closed in the property editor we can activate bond for the back we're going to do the same here we start on a pattern piece press and hold command or control to create curve points and don't press them if you want to create segment points and again please don't create internal lines on top of the pattern outlines the shape should not be perfect but it's just nice if it's nice activate bond here i could create a pattern piece but using zip taping would be faster i think sometimes also sleeve heads have a bit of sim tape ink so i'm going to add it here as well you can hide the view of bond in the 3d window in the toggle bar now it's time to fold the lapel and the collar and i'm going to strengthen the relevant pattern pieces so they're a bit more stiff it will be easier to fold them and now using the fault arrangement tool i'm going to select the line and fold the lapel here i'm going to maximalize the fold angle and activate fault rendering for the second layer i will do the same and then again the same for the collar sometimes i folded the second layer too much and it was a bit difficult to see it because everything was strengthened so everything is orange and my trick here is to strengthen this second layer and to use gizmo to bring this layer a bit to the outside and here i also see that i have a sewing connection that should not be there so i'm going to delete it another trick to make your simulation more stable is to sew the folding line together then set its intensity and thickness to zero the same for the cola zero zero and actually if i check the sewing connection i think that the color stat actually should be sewing together with the other color stand so i'm adding this sewing connection change it to turned and as well this line also turned and then you can simulate very nice let's continue with closing the blazer here i'm going to use pins so w and then press to place a pin and this simulation on and with the help of gizmo you can move one side to a bit to the front and then pull the other side to inside now i'm doing menswear so the left side is on top of the right side for women's where it's usually the opposite way please don't try to save time on this step go a bit slower especially if you don't have so much experience as i have in my case i will actually delete these pins and then set new ones a bit lower and as you can see i'm slowly closing the blazer the result will not be perfect but it should be good enough not to cause big issues then you can delete the pins and now we can add some buttons with the button tool i'm clicking on the markings for buttons then for the other side i'm going to use select move tool right click duplicate as buttonhole to symmetric pattern it's just faster and then with past and button you can fasten all those buttons make sure you deleted all pins before you simulate and once you simulate you get your jacket closed nicely when you have a facing sometimes buttons and buttonholes create some issues between these two layers so you need to see how those layers are connected if you right click on the button holes you can check number of sub-layers here it's two so it's right but the position of the button holes on the facing is a bit wrong so you can just grab them and move them now it looks better sometimes this is not enough then there is another trick you can select baselines of the markings for the buttons and trace those little lines on the facing as well as on the front if you don't have those lines you can draw them it's a bit difficult to see but trust me there are little internal lines and if you have them you can connect the corresponding internal lines with each other so in this phase you fix this position of the buttons and buttonholes even a bit better since those sewing connections are just little 3d tricks we would need to hide the visual representation by setting 3d sim line intensity and thickness to 0. right now because of the pose the placer is pulled to the sides a bit too much you can try to fix it by pulling it while simulating also better way you just change the pose so i would choose here for size pose then it's good to try to simulate once again to see if there are any issues as you can see here one button is fighting with the blazer so i'm going to select all of them and deactivate their collision now they don't have any physicalities and kind fight with fabrics and then with right click reset 3d position you put them on the place where they belong now we can adjust the position of the button holes even better so here we actually have markings a bit differently so i'm going to move it a bit to the right so the buttonholes match with markings and i'm going to change blind position so that the button moves alongside the buttonhole then we can work on the styles of buttons so i'm going to remain this button to the front and then change design there are quite many options just choose the ones that you prefer i will also make this one a bit bigger and then i will create a copy of this style rename it to sleeve because the buttons on the sleeve basically have the same design but they are smaller and then i will do the same process with the buttonholes so i will rename the first one and make its size bigger and then i create a copy rename it and change its size to create buttonholes on the sleeve i'm going to right click on the pattern h so with the tool button right click on the pattern h and here you can decide from which distance from the pattern h you want to place the buttons so i just go at first i start with distance then interval and then i'm going to increase the number of buttons and right now interval is way too big so i decrease it to 10 and then i just click on plus and 11 seem to match the marking and now with select move button i can copy paste them so a bit to the left a bit to the side right click convert to buttonhole and then we can change the angle and in this case our sleeves don't have any vents so it's basically a bit like faking real vents on sleeves and here the button holes and the button are placed on top of each other and we don't need to fasten them because they are placed on the same pattern to add button and buttonholes to the other side we can simply select them right click duplicate to symmetric pattern if you have pockets you can simply trace them but in this case i don't have pockets and i'm going to create them i'm using internal rectangle tool the size of the pocket would be 110 to 20 millimeters then simply move one side up and now this breast pocket has a diagonal shape and then you can adjust its position in 2d checking your design in the 3d window then we create another pocket 130 to only four millimeters and then we are going to create a flap so it would be 130 to 50 millimeters and then i bring them together and to adjust the angle i'm going to select them right click rotate parallel to and then i select the line for the hem and then once of the horizontal lines of the pocket and then again they adjust the position on the blazer now they're a bit too close to the center so i'm going to move them a bit to outside and it would be nice if the pocket will match the dart usually the flap has rounded corners so let's do it as well smooth curve grab the corner bring it up right click 10 centimeters sorry 10 millimeters and 10 millimeters and the same on the other side 10 and 10. now transform pattern select these three shapes one two three right click clone as a pattern now we can add bond to pattern pieces that needed the internal shape for the flap we don't need so we right click on it convert to baseline and then we can start sewing the pockets to those internal shapes the flap can be connected to the other part of the pocket then we create a symmetric copy and superimpose all pockets for the flaps we use superimposed side here on the lapel it would be nice to have a buttonhole so we are adding the buttonhole to the facing and change its angle now let's start adding fabrics and i'm going to hide the view of the internal lines and then in the library fabric there are some fabrics that are suitable for tailoring for example this wool or this one i quite like to use cotton cabartin as well or cotton wheel could be also an option i'm adding one of the linings and then i'm simulating however i would like to have the lining a bit softer so if i select the style of this lining and i go to its physical properties i can change the preset to for example silk charmers for the shell fabric i actually want to do the opposite so i'm keeping its physical properties but i want to delete all textures and use another texture so i found this texture and i'm going to auto generate its normal map by increasing its intensity and actually i would like to have it in another color so i need to desaturate it and then i would love to use one of pantone colors for example sky sky way looks quite nice then i can also change the color of the lining okay maybe not this one maybe something more blue and something shiny looks great then it's also important to match the color of the buttonholes so use the same color and the buttons i would like to have in a darker color and shiny as well let's add some final touches also in connections that secure the facings should be hidden right now they are visible to do it select all of them and then set the 3d line intensity and thickness to zero and now we don't see them anymore the other thing that you can do is to select all pattern pieces set are rectangles or almost rectangles and set their mesh type to quotes another good thing to do is to add additional thickness rendering so for all pattern pieces that are made of lining i'm going to set it to 0.5 all pattern pieces that are made of the shell fabric are going to have additional thickness rendering of one and there is a special case a pocket flap it actually should be made of two pattern pieces but here we are going to fake it by changing its additional thickness rendering to 1.5 and activating double-sided and the last thing sometimes buttons are sinking into the fabric what you can do is to select them and increase the thread length to one or two millimeters that's all for the tailoring workshop i hope you learned something new that will allow you to create your own perfect blazer enjoy the

        "Summary": "# Comprehensive Guide to Creating a Blazer Using Claw Software Welcome to this guide on how to create a beautiful blazer using Claw software, as demonstrated in the tailoring workshop by OLG from Claw Europe. This guide will break down the process into step-by-step instructions, definitions, and tips to help you master digital craftsmanship for tailoring. --- ## **Getting Started** ### **1. Setting Up Your Project** - **Upload Your Pattern**: If you have your own blazer pattern, upload it to the software. If not, use the **Modular Configurator** and its block library to select a blazer pattern. - **Select Blazer Type**: Choose between a double-breasted or single-breasted blazer. For this guide, we will select the **double-breasted** option. ### **2. Choosing Design Features** - **Lapels, Vents, and Sleeves**: Click on the options you prefer for lapels, vents, and sleeves by double-clicking on your choices. ### **3. Deleting Unwanted Modular Frames** - To delete a modular frame, go to **Modular**, select the frame, and press **Delete**. Then return to **Simulation Mode** to adjust the pattern. --- ## **Pattern Preparation** ### **4. Arranging Your Pattern Pieces** - If you're using your own patterns, arrange and sew your pattern pieces. For the modular configurator: - **Fold Vents**: Use the **Arrangement Tool** to fold the vents inside. - **Maintain Distance**: Ensure there is some distance between two arrows when folding. - **Minimalize Fold Angle**: Activate **Fold Rendering** after minimalizing the fold angle. ### **5. Adding Sewing Connections** - Add sewing connections, ensuring that the sewing line type is set to **Turned** for the top of the vent. - Check in the **3D window** to ensure the front is sewn together correctly. ### **6. Adding Fabric Facing** - For a real-world blazer, add 3 cm to the hem for the facing. In Claw, you will offset the pattern outline 30 mm for the internal line. --- ## **Constructing the Blazer** ### **7. Layering the Lining and Shell** - **Show the Lining**: Activate the lining layer and ensure all sewing connections are correct. - **Shrinkage Weft**: Use **Shrinkage Weft** to reduce the size of the lining layer to 85%. - **Unfreeze and Simulate**: After adjustments, unfreeze the lining and gradually return the shrinkage to 100%. ### **8. Sewing Lining to Shell** - Delete sewing connections at the center of the lining to avoid overlaps. - Connect the lining and shell segment by segment, using **Custom Angle** for sewing line types. ### **9. Adding Shoulder Pads** - Use standard shoulder pads from the library (e.g., hardware and trims > shoulder pads). - Hide other pattern pieces to check the position of the shoulder pads. --- ## **Creating Sleeves and Interlining** ### **10. Creating Sleeve Heads** - Use the internal polygon line to trace the shape of the sleeve. - Assign the fabric of shoulder pads to the sleeve piece, then sew it to the shell. ### **11. Adding Interlining** - Select the pattern piece and check **Bond** in the property editor to make it stiffer. - Add interlining to the front, facings, collars, and sleeve hems. --- ## **Finishing Touches** ### **12. Folding Lapels and Collars** - Use the **Fold Arrangement Tool** to fold lapels and collars, maximizing the fold angle and activating fold rendering. ### **13. Closing the Blazer** - Use pins to adjust the blazer's closure. Ensure the left side overlaps the right for men's blazers. - Remove pins after adjustment and add buttons where necessary. ### **14. Final Adjustments** - Check buttonhole alignment and adjust as needed. Use the **Duplicate** tool for symmetrical buttonholes on the opposite side. - Add pockets using the **Internal Rectangle Tool** and adjust for placement and style. ### **15. Adding Fabrics and Textures** - Select appropriate fabrics for the shell and lining from the library. Adjust physical properties for desired softness or stiffness. - Match button and buttonhole colors, and adjust visual representation settings to hide unnecessary details. --- ## **Tips and Tricks** - **Use the Gizmo Tool**: This tool helps in adjusting the position of elements without affecting the overall simulation. - **Simulate Often**: Regularly simulate your work to catch any errors early in the process. - **Layer Management**: Organize your layers effectively; it improves simulation stability and makes editing easier. - **Use the Right Tools**: Familiarize yourself with tools like **Arrangement**, **Sewing**, and **Internal Polygon Line** for efficient pattern editing. --- By following these steps and utilizing the tips provided, you should be well-equipped to create your own perfect blazer in Claw. Enjoy your tailoring journey!"

        "Transcript": "thank you hello welcome to this tutorial this time I'd like to show you how to decorate Nails on glue we'll be using lots of pins and Gizmo so it's gonna be a nice practice with arranging tools hope you enjoy it and if you have any questions please leave them in the comments firstly we need an avatar since I am this is not facing the front we don't have the exact form of the fingers but we can still guide us with the gray shadow of the Avatar let's zoom in a bit into the with our polygon 2 draw a dress of your first nail I'm drawing a long weeks underneath here and since it's such a small piece you quickly notice that you can't be really delicate as when you are beating up garment now my name is ready let me check into the window as well by pressing down the F key on the keyboard as you can see the name is ready to shop we can lower down the particle distance to have smaller meshes than the name will be better shaped and clicking on this target icon here to bring it directly where I want it to be to see how it matches with a finger let me leave it somewhere here then I'll just as well like it more for this exercise I chose to use screen coordinate one here to better visualize I will make this favorite bit transparent properly in the property editor you can lower down the opacity value here then I continue adjusting the nail so that I can refine the form with the selection tool if I double click the pivot point I get to rescale the pattern piece symmetrically maybe shorten it a bit as well this part where the Negroes could be bit rounded then it's time to use the pin box tool we're going to add multiple pins all along the side if you hover over on the pen and outline you will see the light blue point meaning you can add pins here and double click on one of them you can check your pins in 3D in orange color and same for the other side let's see what happens now if we simulate somehow it's not flat but it has an air buffer in it so we'll have to change some settings firstly I will decrease the additional techniques Collision to zero then I assimilate again it goes closer to the knee by 2.5 millimeters and we do the same thing with Avatar we set the skin officer to zero now it's completely flat I will also put the opacity value back to 100 all right now we curve the nails with the pins we change the angle the way it's easy to manipulate the pins then with that simulation on I grab the pins and push it a bit to create curve line since this is such a small piece to move the whole pattern piece you can do the selection into the window then use the Gizmo in 3D window otherwise you will only be able to click on the pins   we can copy and paste for the other fingers I will do the copy paste into the window then adjust to the new finger in 3D window then I repeat the same process for the other fingers   for this pinky we will have to reshape the nail here I remove the pins without W key to check the size and the new shape to avoid it from falling down hold it with left click before activating the simulation then if I like it I add a pins again lastly we have done once again this nail would need some fine tuning now this hand is complete I can then customize it by adding a texture or changing the type of stuff a break Etc here I'm going to add off texture for example in my library I have this texture that I prepared however I also check in wondering how it looks like before copying for the other hand alright looks nice then I can quickly try another type of fabric just for a pleasure then we stop the rendering and let's go for the second hand I turn around my avatar a bit then let's select this set copy and we're gonna mirror paste for the other side the 3D Arrangement is going to be also copied at the same time so we just have to find the right partition again all right then what if you realize you want to change the pose of the avatar let me quickly show you a possible workflow firstly we will attach the pins to the avatar here and now let's go pick another pose in the library here Library go to the Avatar folder female pose then I'm gonna pick this one here if you close up to the nails you will see actually they are all messed up now how we detach them and then simulate quickly then I will remove all the pins now but add again on the surface where it has contact with the fingers and don't forget the other hand otherwise everything will fall down then we can select all the pattern pieces to strengthen them you can do it like this or you can also do control a then strengthen here let's see what happens now if we simulate they are strengthened but falling down since they don't have the right fabric in the property editor we can change the physical property to something very stiff so here the hardware or food grain leather is a very good option now you can put the nails to raise them a bit they will likely to stay there now be careful not to move the whole nail like me the left hand seems to be fine as well now let's go back to the rendering to check how it is presented here once again we can change the type of the fabric to quickly try different effects and be imaginative so this is what I prepared for today hope you enjoyed it and thank you for watching see you next time ",
        "Summary": "## Comprehensive Guide to Decorating Nails on Glue Using 3D Tools Welcome to this tutorial on how to decorate nails using 3D modeling software. This guide will provide you with step-by-step instructions, definitions of key terms, and handy tips and tricks to improve your workflow. ### Step-by-Step Instructions #### Step 1: Setting Up Your Workspace 1. **Prepare Avatar**: Start by selecting an avatar that represents the fingernails you want to decorate. This avatar will serve as a reference point for shaping the nails. 2. **Zoom In**: Use the zoom feature to get a closer view of the avatar's nails. You can do this by using the zoom tool or pressing the appropriate key (often `F` for fit). #### Step 2: Creating the Nail Shape 1. **Draw the Nail**: Use the Polygon tool to create the shape of your first nail. - **Tip**: For smaller pieces, be careful with your detailing as they can be more challenging to shape than larger ones. 2. **Check the Nail**: View your nail from different angles to ensure it looks as expected. Adjust the particle distance to refine the mesh. 3. **Position the Nail**: Drag the nail into position using the target icon to ensure it aligns properly with the avatar's finger. #### Step 3: Adjusting the Nail Appearance 1. **Adjust Opacity**: In the property editor, lower the opacity of the nail to better visualize it against the avatar. 2. **Refine the Shape**: Use the selection tool to adjust the nail shape. Double-click on the pivot point to rescale it symmetrically. #### Step 4: Adding Pins and Simulating 1. **Add Pins**: Use the pin box tool to add multiple pins along the sides of the nail. - **Tip**: Hover over the outline to see where you can add pins. 2. **Simulate**: Click the simulate button to see how the nail behaves. If it appears flat, adjust the collision settings. - **Change Settings**: Set additional collision techniques to zero and adjust the avatar's skin offset to achieve a more realistic look. #### Step 5: Creating Curves 1. **Manipulate Pins**: With simulation on, grab and push the pins to create a curved line for the nail. - **Tip**: For moving the entire nail piece, use the selection tool in 3D view. 2. **Copy and Paste**: Copy the nail design to the other fingers and adjust as necessary. #### Step 6: Final Adjustments 1. **Reshape for Pinky**: For the pinky nail, remove pins as needed, check the size, and reshape accordingly. 2. **Add Texture**: Once satisfied with the nail shapes, add textures from your library. - **Tip**: Test different textures to see which one looks best before applying it to all nails. #### Step 7: Mirroring and Posing 1. **Mirror the Nail Design**: Select the complete set of nails and mirror them to the other hand. - **Tip**: Ensure the arrangement remains aligned. 2. **Change Avatar Pose**: If you wish to change the avatar's pose, attach the pins to the avatar and select a new pose from the library. 3. **Detach and Resimulate**: Detach the pins and simulate again to see how the nails react in the new pose. Add pins back to areas that contact the fingers. #### Step 8: Strengthening and Finishing Touches 1. **Strengthen Nails**: Select all pattern pieces and strengthen them to prevent them from falling. - **Tip**: Use the Control + A shortcut for quick selection. 2. **Change Fabric Properties**: Adjust the fabric properties in the property editor to something stiff for better stability. 3. **Final Rendering**: Switch back to rendering mode to see the final presentation of your nail designs. ### Definitions - **Avatar**: A digital representation of a person used as a model for 3D designs. - **Polygon Tool**: A modeling tool used to create shapes by connecting points in 3D space. - **Opacity**: The transparency level of an object in 3D space. - **Pins**: Fixed points used to hold or manipulate the shape of a 3D object. - **Simulation**: The process of mimicking the physical properties of a model to see how it behaves under certain conditions. ### Tips and Tricks - **Use Keyboard Shortcuts**: Familiarize yourself with keyboard shortcuts to speed up your workflow. - **Save Frequently**: Always save your work periodically to avoid losing progress. - **Experiment with Textures**: Don't hesitate to try out various textures and colors for creative looks. - **Watch for Detail**: Small pieces require precision, so zoom in and take your time adjusting them. - **Utilize Layers**: Use layers for different elements, making it easier to edit specific parts without affecting the whole design. By following this comprehensive guide, you will be able to effectively decorate nails in a 3D environment. Enjoy your modeling experience, and feel free to ask any questions in the comments!"

        "publishedAt": "2022-09-26T13:00:00Z",
        "Transcript": "  my name is Phoebe and in this video we're going to go over how to create a decorative pillow it should be really fun and easy and we'll touch upon a bunch of different things but at the end of the day you'll be able to make a decorative pillow um so let's jump right on in and have some fun learning so here I have Khloe open and ready to go the first thing I'm going to do is create some patterns so to create some patterns I'm going to go to my rectangle tool right over here and my 2D toolbar if I click down you can then get your rectangle tool you can also hit the hotkey which is s I can then just click once with my left Mouse button and type in the measurements that I want so clicking once with your left Mouse will get this Precision box that will be the same for most of the time if you click once with almost any of these creation tools you'll then get a Precision box you can also type in the amount of shapes you want I want to because I want a front and a back verb now I'm going to hit OK and now I have my two pattern pieces I can then select them here and find them in my 3D window I'm not just going to use my Gizmo tool to quickly and easily position these so that they're all set up for myself now I am using the local coordinate Gizmo tool if you right click you can actually change your Gizmo right in here and you just have to right click anywhere in your 3D window and I'm just going to rotate this so that it lays on the ground nice and flat if you hold down shift that will unlock it you'll kind of feel like um it lock a bit all right so now that this is all set up the next thing I'm going to do is start to sew so I'm going to use my segment sewing tool right over here and I'm going to sew in my 3D window I just find it easier to sew pillows in my 3D window because it can get a little bit complicated in my YouTube but you can of course sew it in your 2D if that's what you're comfortable it you also could have used your free sewing tool if you wanted to but I like all right so now let's do the magical thing and let's turn on some gravity which is simulation and our tool is right over here so you can click this button or you could hit your space bar either or now unfortunately our pillow isn't really inflated it kind of fell flat and we're like what no worries so to get it to fall back we're going to just select our pattern pieces over here you can select them in your 2D or 3D window I'm also going to turn off simulation I'm gonna go back to my selection tool and select them and over here in your property editor yours is probably down below I move mine up so that you can see it a little bit better but over here in your property editor you're going to see some new information populate because one good thing to always remember is your property editor is always changing based off of what you're clicking on so because I just clicked on these pattern pieces the information in my property editor is going to be slightly different now so if I scroll all the way down to simulation properties and here I see pressure here I can actually increase my pressure and if I turn on my simulation you'll see how when I play around this toggle the pressure is going to adjust pretty cool right so there are a few things that I do want to tell you about pressure if you already know everything there is to know about pressure just tune me out and like in three minutes I'll start telling you new things but for those of you who don't know everything there is no about pressure please listen so pressure is really great it allows you to create this like puffed up pillow and other things like that but it all does depend on what the facing of your fabric is so because my fabric both of the like front face of my Fabrics are facing out towards like the viewer and everything that is why I could apply pressure the same like positive pressure to both however if I select this pillow and I I'm right clicking and I did look normal I'm just going to select this top one and right click and free so that it doesn't fly away if I now hit simulate it will now conclude in like without going in it's going to concave it whatever um you see because depending on the base of the fabric that is how the part how like it is going to be pushed so positive pressure actually pushes the back of your fabric so it pushes the back of your fabric so that it raises so that your front back front face is then raised out however if you have it so like the back of your fabric is actually um facing out then it's going to like indent in like you see here to fix that all I would have to do is then do negative 12 pressure I'm like finally and it would still look like this to them they put that on freeze however because we want both of our faces out towards the viewer what we're going to do is I'm going to select this right click normal and go back to 12. so that's just the little information that I wanted to give you about pressure it wasn't that bad so we are not just doing this for the pillow um we're giving a decorative pillow this is just a plain pillow so now what we're going to do is add some quilting lines to our pillow to do that we're going to go to our internal polygon line tool which is right below that square tool so rectangle tool and so we're going to select that and we're going to make some diamonds because there's only the diamond I mean and your Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend those are the jokes folks um if you don't like them you don't know what to tell you I wish I was one of your do um so these aren't exactly perfect now you I'm okay with it but I know some of you are like no no what if I wanted it to be perfect there's a lot of ways in which you can make it perfect this is one I want to select this line and I'm going to sit right click and do split so now I have all of these options for split I'm going to say uniform split so that I have a center point and then I hit okay all right so now I'm going to do the same bottom and slip I'm laughing because I'm like if I was all alone I would never do this because okay so now I'm going to move this in and all of that now it's also really nice is there when you hold down shift you're going to get like you're going your lines are going to be able to move straight and you can even see these smart guides with this purple line to help you and also there's a purple line to help you line it up up right directly over there and let me make sure this is all lined up great now look at that it's straight if I wanted to even make sure that it was straight over here watch this I can go to this eye and now I can get a guideline and have this straight and now I can just move it so that that is there and then that goes in there and now we've got wow that's kind of perfect you also could do other points and all of that it's pretty easy now we can also go to the sides I'm gonna do it just for those of you who are like yeah that's what I want and if that's what you want great so I'm going to do split and again I'm going to do uniform and I'm going to split and do uniform great also okay if you wanted to do the most which I'm sure there's some of you who are that person you could do split and then what you could do is for like this line one the yellow one you could do like uh one inch so okay and then you could also do right click um so that one inch level and then you could take this off and then and look at that and then you can do the same for here because then you could make sure everything is really perfect and then you could have done the same over there so that it was truly all lined up I'm not that person I wish I was but I'm not okay and look at that look at that now I feel like I need to adjust this though but we're not doing it okay so now we've got our internal lines it's looking great we've got our diamonds they're the girl's best friend um we're all material girls let me in the material world um and now I'm just gonna right click and what I'm going to do is layer come under so right here why I'm layering cold under is because this will make a complete duplicate copy and also it will sew everything together now some of you might be asking this question well why didn't you lay your phone under first great question this is why if I layer combed under I'm gonna show you on this one right click and if I did layer clone under and then I added in my lines guess what uh they they wouldn't be sewn together so then I would have to sew them all and I know like for a pillow you're like that's not really a big deal but imagine if you were making a puffer jacket or if you have a lot of quilting lines then it would be a big deal so that is why I always put in the internalized verse and then move your clone under and you can actually even see the um all the sewing lines and everything all connected right here so now to make this look more realistic I'm going to select this bottom one and I'm actually going to give it you guessed it pressure and I'm going to give it negative five pressure and simulate so that it Puffs down and like look at that look how much this looks like a filter pillar looks so much like recorded one so now that I wanted to like give puff it back up a bit I could just select the two fronts like the two outer ones and add some more pressure here   and I could also like maybe add some more pressure here and all of them it's looking great look at that okay we aren't done yet though we're gonna add like some Ruffles to the sides so now I'm going to click here and we're going to add some Ruffles so we're going to do with 20 um height 2 I'm going to say four now I could have done one long one all around but I'm not about that life so this is what I'm doing now I'm going to do free so for these edges because when I did that like Perfection Diamond thing um I created segment like separate segment lines so I need to do the free so so that everything's all so easily okay now instead of just having simulate and having them all move I'm going to actually superimpose these to the side so what I'm going to do is I'm going to right click in my 3D window and say super on both side this is a really helpful tool I use it often it's kind of great I glues like places or pattern pieces based off of where you sewed it and the sewn line so now it's super on both side what I'm also going to do is a little drag is I'm going to do layer one so that it's above and when I hit simulate look at that they're all out and look at that something's wrong it's okay there's Ctrl Z for a reason I have a feeling there's still something wrong it's just a feeling we're gonna find out if I'm right I wouldn't be surprised if I'm wrong so bad all right let's try it again all right I think it's just because it was like caught inside all right cool so I do see though that some of mine are flipped so I'm just going to select this right click and click normal and now I'm just going to select these edges and change it back to layer 0. and you know what I'm also going to do I'm going to change the particle distance of these you don't know a lot about particle distance I would suggest going into our beginner's training guide and watching that it's really helpful and it gives you a lot of great information about different ways in which the code works and just like some great background info to help you achieve what you want to achieve so I want these like little Ruffles to poof up so I'm using pressure I'm gonna add like two that's great and now what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to have a separate fabric for these edges because we're this is the decorative pillow so like we're fancy people so one fabric isn't enough for us obviously um I want you all to know I have a lot of throw pillows in my house apartment so like I'm not putting any judgment on any degree okay so we have our pillow it's looking great now we get to do the most fun part and add materials to everything I think it's the most fun part so first I'm going to go into my library here and I'm going to go into my Fabrics Cole has a bunch of different default Fabrics I'm actually going to use a linen and what's nice okay well it's really nice is when you hit simulate because I'm going to turn off pressure so it doesn't just like keep going when you have simulation on the personal final image here it is when you drop the fabric in and then you simulate you'll see it change oh actually know what we're gonna do because I'm I'm leaning into the fancy we're going to change it to like a silk I just don't know which one as you can see when you hover over um you can see like a preview of how it will drape and look bullying clown which is really nice I think I want to do this one okay wow Morgan and Royal Johnson thoughts great okay we've got now a silk pillow fantastic so now that we've got our Fabric in I'm going to add a print on top so I'm going to go into my artwork here my library you can add like any folder you want within clothes again if you want to know more check out The Beginner's Guide there's a link below um in the description of this video please check it out so I'm going to add in this print I'm just going to drag and drop it onto my fabric there's a lot of different ways in which you can add prints and stuff again beginner's guide it's really great if I go over here to my edit texture tool I can select my print and now adjust and move the size of this around to however I would like it because also since I decided to do like a soapy thing I can also now select this and change my type and maybe make it Microsoft exam so that's like it's looking wow now I need a different fabric for this because I actually want to add tassels because this is a very fancy pillow we are not eating around this couch at all like that is the level of fancy and I'm just going to again so for this one I'm going to drag and drop the texture onto my fabric I do want you all know there's multiple ways in which you can do this you could have also selected this fabric changed it to become opaque uh right clicked and added this as a graphic and then placed it on and that would have worked too like both ways are perfect I'm just gonna do the fabric way because honestly just because like that's the way I'm doing it it's because both ways are perfect like you can use whichever way you want there's a thousand ways to do almost everything within Club it's all in whichever way you like doing it the most and if you like doing it with Graphics then do it with Graphics if you like doing it with all right then do it with fabric so now I'm just going to use again this edit texture you have it in both your 3D and 2D window so you can use it in both what is nice about the 2D window is if you right click while clicking and holding down you'll get a Precision box Gotta Love A Precision box and you can then adjust and move this it's pretty cool it's kind of rad all right um and now what I can also do is I can rotate this all around so that it's the right way you can also change brain lines if you wanted to but we're not about that um because that is something that your practice might have to do so we're gonna just place this exactly where we want it to be you can continue to like fiddle around so that it's exactly perfect and everything looks exact and amazing this is when I am that person and I'm like yeah we're taking the time for that that looks great okay so now we've got our tassels and what we can also do is we're going to select our tassels I'm gonna go to our color tab in our property editor and we're going to use that eyedropper tool and we're going to get a color from the pillow because yeah you can DTM things great so now we've got that all set now we're going to do the finishing touches so we're going to add a button and we're going to add some top stitches so again if you want to know more about buttons and how you can add them and everything beginner guide who really has almost everything you need but there are our button tool is over here in our 3D window you can click it right here and what's nice is you can add it in either your 2D or 3D window I'm going to do 2D because I want to be able to place it right on top of these like intersections and everything so look at that I mean just going around and placing them what's nice of them are going to adjust these buttons so that they look exactly how we want them to look and that's it right no it's not there we go okay great we've got our buttons and now let's also go into our top Stitch now again for those of you who don't know and our Hardware in terms Library folder there's a whole library of iso standard top stitches that you can just drag and drop into your object browser or of course you can create your own top Stitch if you wanted to both options are great I'm going to create my own because I can and I am and I'm just going to play around with some thread thickness if you want to know more information about all of the things you can do with top stitches and how you can edit them adjust them how you can create your own The Beginner's Guide I don't know if I've mentioned it before but it's really great and you it will tell you all the things you need to know so here I'm just applying my top stitches onto my pillow and now I can zoom in and you can see it really easily also because this is a decorative top search I'm going to play around with my SBI yeah that's fine yeah okay and now let's go into our buttons let's play around with that so right now we have our default button but you can play around with the shape and size and all of those things there's more information on what you want to do and how you can uh like adjust and play around with buttons and not beginner's guide I know I've already mentioned it but just amazing um you can also even change the type of this so let's actually say it's shiny and I'm going to jump back into my library in my art and I'm just going to drag and drop this in now let's say you didn't have your artwork over here in your library and you you there are these like file opens in both like your buttons and also in your fabric so you could do this file open and then it will take you to your files that you have and you can grab it through there within your computer so no worries if you're like um what if I don't have it cut out that's fine and as you can see you can change the type so maybe we actually need that so that's really shiny we're going with The Shining effect and look at this we've got a decorative pillow in a matter of minutes I can simulate it again and it's looking great and what I'm going to do finally to really like wow is I'm going to make this high-res so the high-rise button is right over here and it will automatically like lower your particle distance and your collision and everything to make it look a little bit more realistic and you can even see like now there's like little folds and Gatherings here and the Final Touch is I am going to add this thing it's called puckering if you go into the object browser over here you can then get it and then you have this default Puck ring so this is how I like to do puckering I like to apply it first and then play around and adjust it based off of what I see and how I want it so that's all I'm going to do it however you could play around with it first and then apply it so really it's your world so here I'm going to select the default Puck ring and the main things that you can play around with is the normal map so this is going to make it so like you can see it a little bit more easily you see how I make it at 200 you see this a lot you wouldn't really want it that intense because this was like really it's kind of right at you you can also play around with your density so the higher you may get the farther apart it'll be that's a little bit more realistic one of the things I tell almost everybody is it's really important to jump into your render window and check this out because as you can see it changes quite often um on how it looks now this is very shiny so of course you could go back in and then you could say like hey maybe a little less shine or something but you can keep playing around in all of that and for me great but here you have it a great decorative pillow but what's even better is then you can put it in a great 3D environment like this one and have like a whole scene for you to show off to people thank you so much for watching this video I hope you enjoyed learning all about decorative pillows and everything that goes into it if you have any questions please feel free to write in the comments below also please like And subscribe to the glow Channel there's so many great videos that you can watch about a lot of different subjects and Concepts within flow there's also great the great beginner's guide which I've mentioned a few hundred times now I think and other great workflows that you can watch that will be really helpful to you thanks again for watching and I hope you enjoyed ",

Enter the desired dimensions for your pillow front and back pieces. 3. **Duplicate Patterns**: Specify the number of shapes you want (2 for front and back) and hit 'OK'. 4. **Position Patterns**: Use the Gizmo tool in the 3D window to position the patterns. Right-click to change the Gizmo type if needed. ### Step 3: Sew the Patterns Together 1. **Select the Segment Sewing Tool**: Find the segment sewing tool in the toolbar. 2. **Sew in 3D Window**: Use the 3D window to sew the patterns together. Alternatively, you can sew in the 2D window if preferred. 3. **Activate Gravity**: Click the simulation button or press the space bar to enable gravity. ### Step 4: Inflate the Pillow 1. **Turn Off Simulation**: Disable simulation to adjust properties. 2. **Select Patterns**: Click on the pattern pieces in either the 2D or 3D window. 3. **Adjust Pressure**: In the Property Editor, scroll to 'Simulation Properties' and increase the 'Pressure' value to inflate the pillow. 4. **Turn On Simulation**: Enable simulation again to see the effects of the pressure. ### Step 5: Add Quilting Lines 1. **Select Internal Polygon Line Tool**: Choose this tool to create decorative lines on your pillow. 2. **Create Diamond Shapes**: Draw diamond shapes as desired. 3. **Split Lines**: Right-click on a line and select 'Split' → 'Uniform Split' to add more control points for precise adjustments. 4. **Align Lines**: Use the Shift key to move lines straight and utilize smart guides for alignment. ### Step 6: Layering and Finalizing Design 1. **Layer Clone Under**: Right-click and select 'Layer Clone Under' to create a duplicate and sew everything together. 2. **Adjust Pressure for Details**: Apply negative pressure to create a realistic puffed effect. 3. **Add Decorative Elements**: Consider adding ruffles or other embellishments by creating additional pattern pieces. ### Step 7: Material Application 1. **Select Fabrics**: Open the Fabric Library and choose a suitable fabric type (e.g., silk or linen). 2. **Apply Fabrics**: Drag and drop the fabric onto your pillow. 3. **Add Prints**: Use the Artwork Library to add designs or prints to the fabric. 4. **Adjust Textures**: Utilize the Edit Texture tool to resize and reposition prints as needed. ### Step 8: Add Finishing Touches 1. **Add Buttons**: Use the Button Tool to place buttons on the pillow. Adjust size and shape as necessary. 2. **Create Top Stitches**: Go to the Top Stitch Library and drag a top stitch onto the pillow. Adjust the thickness and style as needed. 3. **Apply Puckering**: For a more realistic look, apply puckering using the Object Browser. Adjust parameters to get the desired effect. ### Step 9: Render Your Design 1. **High-Resolution Render**: Click the high-res button to enhance detail and realism in your design. 2. **Check Final Appearance**: Use the Render Window to preview how your pillow looks under various lighting conditions and adjust accordingly. ## Definitions - **Gizmo Tool**: A tool used for moving, rotating, and scaling objects in 3D space. - **Pressure**: A property that simulates the inflation or deflation of 3D objects, such as pillows. - **Simulation**: A feature that allows you to see how fabrics will behave in a real-world context, including gravity and pressure effects. - **Top Stitch**: A decorative stitch used to finish edges or add detail to garments. ## Tips and Tricks - **Use the 3D Window for Sewing**: It provides a better visual perspective for complex shapes. - **Experiment with Fabrics**: Each fabric behaves differently; playing with different types can yield unique results. - **Utilize Smart Guides**: These guides help in aligning elements accurately. - **Save Frequently**: To prevent losing work, save your project frequently. - **Explore the Beginner’s Guide**: If you're new to Clo3D, the Beginner’s Guide is an excellent resource for foundational knowledge. ## Conclusion By following these steps, you can create a beautiful decorative pillow in Clo3D. Don’t hesitate to explore different fabrics, patterns, and embellishments to make your design truly unique. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to leave a comment. Happy designing!"

        "Transcript": "  hi everyone again I'm Natalie I am a business development manager here at Khloe Europe we are based out of Munich in Germany and I'm very happy today to welcome you to our fourth session um within the academic month which is dedicated to academics here at club with schools and universities showcasing how they have implemented Khloe into their curriculum and today I have the pleasure to host a session for Manchester Metropolitan University with not only one lecture but three lecture telling about their insights quite exciting so we have a presentation um from Metropolitan Manchester Metropolitan University for around half an hour a little bit more and depending on yeah how long you guys are going to speak and then we're gonna open up the session for a q a so whenever you have questions please feel free um chat use the chat to send us a message and then we are happy to answer all your questions um so yeah that's it for my site so welcome Anita Jane and Adrian and I'm very much looking forward to learn about your insights today well hello everybody my name is Anita Mitchell I'm head of the fashion section and digital lead at Manchester Fashion Institute at Manchester Metropolitan University the purpose of this presentation is to share our journey with implementing closed 3D into our curriculum and to help to contextualize this I'd like to briefly introduce you to our Institute and indeed our University Manchester Metropolitan University has around 34 000 students and we have a huge alumnus that spans over 170 countries research is a strength of the university and particularly at the faculty of arts and design which houses the Manchester Fashion Institute Manchester Fashion Institute has just under 3 000 fashion students and has been ranked second in the UK for Art and Design research and sixth in the UK for fashion and textiles the university has a silver award for teaching Excellence the University is also ranked first in the UK for sustainability in universities Manchester Fashion Institute has cutting-edge resources that sit across a large state-of-the-art building that included digital Studios immersive Studios fashion Studios and specialist workshops that are all supported by uh incredibly experienced technical support teams we've got a long-standing link with industry Partners in the luxury and high high-end sector and this obviously supports a live project and work-based learning fashion students have access to a huge range of Cutting Edge Technologies and these include anything from uh our textile testing equipment and sublimation printers automated cutting so moving on I'd like to outline our journey with 3D prototyping and digital Technologies which started nearly 20 years ago when we originally introduced it into our curriculum and at this time we continue to teach 3D prototyping as part of the institute's focus on technical Innovation for fashion even though the wider fashion industry uh at that time remained unconvinced of the tremendous value it offered so around five years ago we recognized that fashion industry was facing further major challenges much of which could be solved through digitalization and it was obviously at this point that we developed a digital strategy to drive our technology and to drive obviously ourselves forward with these with these um actual uh 3D prototyping skills so um so so basically in a nutshell in keeping with our strategic plan we have supported our staff I think my slide has jumped on a little bit um we've supported our as part of our strategic plan we supported our staff to upscale in the use of clothes 3D but also to gain a better understanding of the pedagogy associated with this technology so there are graduates can exit our Institute industry ready and future proof and able to lead in a rapidly changing job market are driven by digitalization so reflecting Upon Our Journey so far we've realized and resolved a number of challenges in our implementation of clue 3D firstly we've all realized and accepted that learning a new piece of software is not an instance process it's an ever-evolving journey and you get out of it really I suppose what you put into it which leads me to my second point which is it's crucial and it's so important that academic staff with you know half the appropriate training and more importantly we recognize how much effort it takes to actually champion this technology especially when you're working in a very busy fashion School Beyond this issue of Staff training we also have considered the importance of headspace for actually practicing the software and that's obviously another really important factor in the planning process keeping on top of practicing needs self-discipline but also buy-in for management and this is an area that we continue to work hard on but our most valuable asset is not just our wonderful students but our precious academics and Technical staff and I'd like to introduce you to some of our key players who have been instrumental in ensuring successful implementation of Khloe 3D into the curriculum the 3D fashion team include myself uh Adrian Thornton Mary aspinall Willow Dill Russell abuse I am Jay meekin and Rebecca Theory each member has contributed a short presentation of their Journey today within overarching themes to include hybrids which will obviously consider the interface between uh the uh I suppose the feature old digital and diversity in terms of how Khloe can support the development of sustainable fashion apparel that accommodates diversity of shape and Aesthetics developments and animation and virtual reality will provide an insight into our future aims and objectives with 3D prototyping and finally how we have used Khloe to support International collaboration with academic and Industry Partners around the globe some of the team including Mary Willow and Abu cannot be here today so I'm going to be presenting their content on their behalf so moving on let me hand you over to Adrian who will present his journey called hybrids over to Adrian thank you hi I'm a senior lecturer in Creative patakoten here at Manchester Metropolitan University my special students are flat button cutting digital and virtual pattern making tailoring and garment technology the following slides will discuss how hybrid smart framework emerged during the pandemic which has now been embedded into our curriculum uh hybrid physical Blended learning a novel framework to learn and teaching practice based fashion so the images to the left of the screen illustrate how students have created well-informed what doesn't work utilized in the hybrid smart framework Illustrated here to the right the student showcased here how those I've demonstrated and accomplished skill set for traditional partner make practices which have been underpinned by their ability to explore new technologies finding alternative Solutions in presenting their potential to the fashion industry during the first web of the pandemic 2021 Solutions facilitating online learning and teaching or practice based fashion were explored with online zoom and things being adopted this enables tutors to reach students who were living in isolated conditions during this time including the students showcased here it was quickly recognized that working small the Tony's day of time extent on fabric and paperwork but also contributing creating a more sustainable engagement in the learner teaching or practice based fashion the hybrid smart framework has since been embedded into our students learn their craft first year students are encouraged to make half-scale mannequins and begin their inquiry in miniature reflected past and current industry practices and they're also introduced to do two-digital pattern making Gerber technology second year students continue this practice are introduced to close 3D with the option of working slowly with digital outputs third year students have the option to engage with Cloud 3D as best fits their practice once the students have learned the basics of Clone 3D they're able to develop their design in best ways that suit their preferred learning style so prefer to the hybrid smart framework some students will begin their design processing flow 3D Xbox in DFX files into Gerber to develop their patterns and our work in the real world importing their manual patterns integer and exporting import index Dex head files into clone or they may work in the real world on cloud environments it's anticipated that students will alternate between environments as and when they feel necessary providing them with the flexibility and the knowledge that their simulated garments won't fit in the real world I believe it is important to encourage a hybrid smart framework in a practice-based learning environment our students are still learning their craft where real world experimentation underpin underpin students problem solving the unknown the students showcase here have all options to study digital outputs as their submissions for at least one unit of study however at some point they all felt the need to sample closely they generated simulated designs in the real world is as full scale 12 or power 12 and four or half scale subsequently two students Illustrated here I've seen secured work placements as virtual pattern Cutters it would be interesting to see how far these students have developed since learning class 3D at Manchester Fashion Institute I would like to close this section of my presentation and convey a student testimonial uh and it's one of the students that actually uh secured a work placement as a virtual pattern cutter working digital has really been enjoyable it says plenty of time and resources When developing garments after working digitally you quickly understand where it falls short which has led me to work in both physical and digitally intricate details and insights of gamma certifications aren't so achievable unless you are very patient and so it makes much more sense to sample them physically alongside this dual practice helped me to think about how my gamuts would be made while creating digital Solutions and how I'd like to continue working even When developing physical garments thank you thank you thanks very much Adrian so now I'd like to introduce uh Mary aspinall who is a member of the 3D team and as I mentioned earlier unfortunately Mary can't be here today but Mary is a specialist 3D prototyping technician with over 26 years experience within the product development and digital pattern cutting areas she has provided a summary of how she supported students to create sustainable fashion products she's include 3D and for this particular example um she wanted to discuss how she supported a particular student to create a zero West Sports league and aimed at exercise and control of body temperature as part of this process a pattern for the active 24 range uh uh was was produced it was a legend and it was initially produced using Gerber software Mary created a supportive learning environment working on a one-to-one basis with a student to create a digital twin with the close 3D using obviously key body measurements this was to ensure highly accurate fit was achieved due to the performance nature of the Garment the workflow was developed to include maps for fabric stress strain and fit using garment fit properties to get more accurate results that covered the amount of stretching that the student predicted would have in her garments the student was also supported to develop her understanding of digital fabric performance whilst developing 3D prototype this was very important for the student to understand the performance characteristics of a stretch fabric degrading tools include 3D also proved to be advantageous enabling side ranges to be created whilst assessing physical and aesthetic fit on a plus size Avatar using different poses and motions as expert in Gerber technology Mary was able to support the student to understand how Gerber and Khloe 3D can work together and work to create sustainable design Solutions she was able to work on methods to place the pattern either horizontally or vertically since the fabric had four-way stretch properties and this helped to obviously minimize fabric waste and create a more sustainable products Mary also supported the students to create an industry standard Tech pack using uh obviously closet and introduced obviously a variety of new colorways in this instance due to Mary's help and assistance as she can obtain the distinction in the product development unit um and she's obviously uh learning how to use Virtual simulation to make her designs and processes so much more sustainable saving at least 50 more time for the design process and also being able to produce the Garment on demand and afterwards now what I'd like to do next is I'd like to introduce you to Dr Abu Sadat Mohammed Siam who obviously also cannot be here today but Abu is a researcher and lecturer at Manchester Fashion Institute whose interests lie in digital fashion and sustainable material Innovation Abu teaches closely close 3D design software undergraduate and postgraduate level within the timetable workshops he initially introduces the students to key functions of Club 3D and then proceeds to introduce intermediate tools and techniques our students learn how to change sizes and shapes of avatars and how to draft 2D patterns obviously arrange the pattern pieces and they learned about different sewing techniques and then move on to much more complex garments at Manchester Metropolitan University we have a rise in Township that uh we obviously call rise and our this allows our students to work closely with academics and tutors to gain some additional skills of knowledge beyond the curriculum requirements in uh 2122 Abu developed a rise in Township project on fashion animation and one of the students worked with him to develop a fashion animation video the next slide will present an excerpt of this work and you can see what the student produced so let me just move to that and play it   Adventure   so the development of the animation that you watched involves Avatar morphing then the development of 3D garments and once the 3D simulation of garments on the Avatar is done a motion was assigned to the Avatar and finally the animation video clip was captured while at the animation mode of the closed 3D software so I'd now like to hand you over to Jane micken hello everybody so I'm Jane meaker nice to meet you virtually I'm also a senior lecturer in fashion technology and a researcher within the Patrick Institute um and I think you already know that we're based in the northwest of the UK I'm fortunate really to bring industry experience and work in InDesign product development and Senior roles in fashion technology companies throughout the UK Europe USA and the Far East so I'm a specialisms sit at the intersection of fashion practice technical communication digital Innovation Frameworks and also health and the body so today I'd like to share with you just one example of an application of Clone 3D within the curriculum and in this case it's at level seven which is Master's level so as part of the Manchester Fashion Institute Suite of masters programs the M.A in fashion design and Technology attracts a range of UK and also International students including mature students with varying levels of Industry experience I currently lead the digital Innovation unit which is developed to foster a spirit of collective experimentation where students are encouraged to challenge their own assumptions of their future fashion practice and as you've already heard we teach Khloe 3D at undergraduate levels and so the Masters cohorts were encouraged to join the undergraduates to build Khloe 3D skills and knowledge and also build on that sense of community the cohort in this example had a mixed range of Clow 3D experience some from basic right through to Advanced when we came to this unit this unit glow 3D plays a significant role in introducing concepts of materiality and actually to bring into question what students could consider their future fashion practice might be the focus was on conceptual thinking so any required skills building was supported by the academic team but also Mary's technical expertise was indispensable throughout playful weekly provocations we encourage critical thinking of clothes 3D and Anita was also my fellow colleague on this unit and this was positioned actually as a potential Catalyst through which they could explore products and processes and each student developed a proposal to address a topic from their research all of them Incorporated elements of Khloe 3D the application of Clow 3D was situated across four key themes and they were product process method and Technology taking a playful approach students were encouraged to study as a collective in a hybrid virtual and on-site immersive Studio space so this was post covered but we gave them the opportunity to work hybrid and the idea was that they could come together to share ideas debate and seek feedback from their peers and the academics and guest lecturers they also produced a range of outcomes and this was super interesting so there are seven different types of outcomes that they came up with so firstly using flow 3D to design and prototype digital only products secondly to develop nft product Concepts thirdly hybrid digital design and sampling with physical sampling which also resulted in physical product outcomes some use cloud 3D to design for 3D printing and some investigated ways to interact with consumers using Pro 3D in a different way than they had done previously some use code 3D to explore Integrations and interconnections with other 3D Technologies themselves and finally the seventh iteration with some use cloud 3D to communicate future strategies of digitally enhanced wearable products so we found that there was an interest in breadth of approaches and all cited measurable sustainability goals within their project outcomes so of course we did have challenges as we do with any new needs and the challenges tended to center around the time scale of a six-week block of study so it's quite fast and furious deep diving and this in the name is because students were pushing the boundaries of their practice and were actually really really enthusiastic to explore possibilities so this has now been addressed going forward as we move to 11 week semesters which will give them a little bit more space and time so finally Reflections on the unit highlighted how students felt more confident in articulating a critical awareness of Clow 3D actually is a mechanism for change within their practice rather than merely just a set of 3D skills to learn so now I'm actually going to speak on behalf of Rebecca Mary who's also enjoying some weather somewhere Rebecca is a fellow colleague and Senior lecturer in fashion design at Manchester Fashion Institute she's also our International Project Lead with seven years in higher education and over 10 years of Industry experience in design and sustainable strategies her specialisms in our design holistic thinking sustainability strategy Innovation and inclusivity along with specifics of digital print knit and Menswear   lockdown in 2020 she led a collaborative design project with our International partner in Beijing Institute of fashion design and Technology known here is biffed along their side this project and I contributed to delivering introductory Cloud 3D sessions and supporting them through an online community students had the opportunity to partner with a Biff student to design and create a collection based on the themes of sustainability Innovation and inclusivity so this is a case study of two students Natalia and the Jew utilizing Khloe 3D to produce garments asynchronously and Sample their ideas so of course they were working across time zones of UK and China and neither the you or Natalia adding which is their first language so actually Khloe 3D became an environment that transcended this they used fashion language in the Khloe 3D environment to prototype and communicate their ideas visually these glow 3D garments went on to be curated into the Biff and mmu Fashion Institute film which is celebrating a deep digital fashion outcomes and Intercultural collaborations and sustainable practice Anita would you like to play that   thank you what was super interesting as well is that the language barriers were actually truly transcended and also a generational differences because Natalia is a mature student and the union Reserve going through student so super interesting to be involved in that so overall students who integrated and interacted with Khloe 3D actually displayed increased self-efficacy metacognition and actually positive digital confidence they embraced this technology as an enabler for their practice and they value digital as outputs and overall we found that the Khloe 3D sessions were actually oversubscribed it was difficult um to get everybody in this so This agile pedagogy created an environment of virtual mobility and Intercultural communication which allowed students to experience a less eurocentric approach to design thinking which was super helpful for us to give those students that opportunity our students value materiality and physical practice and they now Champion the experimentation and the expedition that this Khloe 3D technology and technology is generally can add to that interdisciplinary fashion practice the film above is a celebration of all of this and showcases how Cloe 3D coupled with Intercultural projects such as this can actually add a multi-layered enrichment to the Student Learning Journey and now we're in our third generation of this project going into 22 23. with biffed and we're actually really excited to see how this continues and develops over the coming year so thank you um I'll hand you over to any attorney so I've just got one more little bit too further represent what uh Jane was just presenting uh         time   so I'm sure you'll agree the quality of the strings design work there which is obviously undertaken as Jane said with clothes 3D and then obviously physically prototyped was particularly excellent so um just uh in terms of our future with uh Khloe 3D this will obviously include a range of digital boot camps to launch a new Academic Year including a variety of events uh that will take place to support obviously further staff training and student development with Khloe 3D um and uh I suppose really um I'd like to just move on to to say thank you very much for listening to our short presentation um and uh if you have any questions we'd love to hear from you there's also some contacts here if anybody wants to get in touch with any of our academic or technical staff um and um and um I'm back to you uh Marie thank you thank you Anita and thank you to all of you three um so um we really enjoyed um all the um yeah the information about your um um curriculum and also about all the students and projects particularly I was really inspired by um natalias and Lee juice story about the communication because it is also really uh for us very important to emphasize that 3D can can really be this this language that can be used worldwide and as we know in the in the world in the industry out there we not only work um with Partners within our own country our native language but also very globally and internationally so 3D can really be helpful to bring everyone a little bit more together and and and and easier smoother language to be used by everyone so that gave me really a little bit of Goosebumps to be honest to hear about that experience for them within their studies so thank you to all of you and also thank you for including um the the content of the other lectures um I'm very happy that we got this whole overview of um how you teach and what you teach at a metropolitan uh Manchester Metropolitan University so enough of talking from my side are there any questions um from the audience um that you would like to address to the speakers today uh here is one thank you for sharing the applications and results of the students the connection with zero waste inclusive avatars gender inclusion was inspiring and there is also uh another long message is there any way we can hear about more training for academic stuff I'm currently using YouTube clothes with your videos to teach myself but would love more interactive and face-to-face training this is also exciting amazing um I guess is that a little bit more addressed to the close staff I guess or I guess um there is a workshop maybe this is a time for me also to promote a little bit our Workshop because next week we're gonna do an academic Workshop it's actually sold out I believe but we do this more often throughout the year so um watch out for our social media or send us a message and to the representatives you might already know at Khloe and because we can give you more information Nation about the next course exactly Jane as well James you want to go first yeah yeah but that's fine and yeah I was just in terms of academic staff um as Anita very rightly sad I mean Anita's our lead and principal lecturer so in terms of that top down management to actually get buy-in for us and obviously there is that self-discipline for people to actually attend but um we've really fostered an environment where um we we use teams so we have an online community chat space for staff and we post I also developed during covid um a SharePoint so basically a website for for sharing and building resources between ourselves um but really to have that commitment to go on clone 3D sessions as uh Natalie Natalie as just mentioned now it is like really really key so even though we might have been on it once we go on it again which I think is unusual for um for some business models that you would literally be sent on a course once and that's it you know you'll have to continue but I need to teach the approach that actually yeah we know pedagogically that we only learn about 40 of what we're taking in you know what you're exposed to at any one time and so we we do that and but the the online community chat space for staff and fostering that environment and regular get-togethers and chats that typically virtually at the moment um is how we handle it amazing that's amazing to hear really because I think our aim is also to to bring all staff a little bit closer together because I think there is so much experience that you can share with each other and gain those insights to bring it back to your own University or school and and all of that so amazing thank you for sharing that yeah I just wanted to follow on the back of what Jane was saying um and really you know sitting sitting in front of a video on YouTube can be a very lonely experience and also it can be quite hard to keep your motivation up and you know for all those Club users out there you've got to practice every day you've got to do 10 minutes if that's all you can do do 10 minutes every day if you can do half an hour a day brilliant you'll be Super Sonic and amazing but if you if you go about it thinking oh I'll book the whole day out you'll spend the whole day practicing code three it ain't gonna happen guys forget it unless you've got a really light look you know workload or you haven't got a lot of assignments to do if you're a student so keep it small keep it bite-sized but the other thing that I find can be really motivational is as Jane said our communities of practice and that's really about getting like-minded people who want to be close users and really good flow users to work together because what that does is it gets a bit of competition going and if you've got like Adrian or Jay will post some amazing design that they've done last week and I'll be looking at it thinking oh God I'm really behind now I I can't do that and then that makes me think I want to do something better and before you know it we're all grappling to be better than each other and that's great because ultimately as a team of people we're getting better and better and better and if you can find people whether they're online or they're in your own school or somewhere else that would be great one of the things that I find is we're we're linked to a wonderful school um another school in our university called soda which is the school of digital art and we have some um some some people there who uh are really excellent animators and they they know how to use Marvelous Designer and so I've teamed up and some of our other academics have teamed up with those sorts of um apparel creators and you're learning so many different tips and tricks that you just wouldn't know about so if you can find other people from other Industries um that use this technology this prototyping technology don't forget Marvelous Designer was obviously developed by cloves so it's another another extension of Khloe and it means that you might end up getting a job in a completely unrelated sector that you didn't even realize it doesn't have to be fashion it doesn't have to be apparel it can be performance apparel it can be apparel for gaming and so on and so forth anyway no that that's really amazing because that's true um we see that there is this new role um not the introde into the into the fashion industry that is called a 3D artist and that does not only include to be able to use clothes but maybe also think wider in this Marvelous Designer Community into like animation and all of that and um and that is going to be maybe even more important not more yeah it's going to be important in the future as well to not only be able to to create a 3D garment but also take it in in action or being able to present it well and um yeah great oh I see that Jane you already um answered one of the questions from the chat thank you for that so yeah is there any more questions I've got a question oh yeah personal hi my name is Pierce I teach a fashion design at Falmouth University and we also we also use Chloe Freddie in our second and third year when we teach I was wondering did you also use the software pre-covet or was this very much okay this is the best opportunity for for trying this out now and no we were already using it um but it did give us an opportunity to encourage even more students um to to get engaged with it but to be honest we've we've we've sat with this framework which Adrian was talking about part physical part digital so even in the home Studios we encourage them to sample half scale as well as um using whatever tools that they got so they still had that materiality because when you're talking to second year students as you all know they have to have that understanding the physical world if it's going to be a physical product outcome and of course it might not always be that going forward but but yeah yeah so that's where we were already doing it as Anita mention we've been using 3D Technologies for over 20 years in varying capacities but glow 3D is super practice accessible in terms of licenses and actually the team themselves and also really being able to have accessibility to those online sessions and and we you know I went over to Munich for the earlier sessions The Fast and Furious sessions um but but yeah yeah so that's what I hope that answered your question yeah great thank you okay thank you how long have you been doing uh using Khloe girch we um I think we started we I think we got licenses for maybe about five years ago yeah uh and and then it was just Adam uh Friday uh Friday lunchtime Club if you wanted to come and join and also in the meanwhile staff training up but we currently only have two people actively working with it and uh we um it's uh working from home day um we um so it's quite difficult like you say you have to train the staff and or they'd have to train themselves basically to learn how it works and then and then get it ready to be implemented so for us when covet started it was a good a good option because of the social distancing in the studio but we were still on campus until because Cornwall was okay for our lockdowns until the second lockdown so we were still we were using it and then the experimentation of it's really exciting because the second year all of a sudden went like this in terms of what they could achieve but by the time we went to print it out of course lots of things yeah but how do I actually make this and that was also quite exciting yeah it's a different construction technique and I think than for those that are new to Chloe that are on here just understanding and being very transparent and saying right well if you're doing it IRL in real world then this is the approach you would take and if you're not sure go in sampling but equally valid is the digital construction techniques especially when there's going to be um digital outcome I think it's really super interesting to be able to experiment with these Technologies for sure yeah also and it's really interesting to see that there's now participants parties the majority is probably from your course but I think when we do this again next year I'm sure the numbers are not 30 and in two years Time the numbers are also not 30 because it's yeah it's nice to see how people start using it more actively and I think it's very much yeah it's very exciting time thank you for sharing the work all right can I just double check if the recording is also being sent out so we can share it with our staff our current people today yeah yeah that's a good question so we're gonna make sure that we get all the recordings a little bit prepped and then we plan to publish it on YouTube around mid of August um so check out YouTube our YouTube channel if you're not already subscribed um or we we will see if we send out another email um to let you all know that the recordings are published then one thing I wanted to just mention as well is that whilst there's a great number of Staff dealing with Cloud 3D and we have that competitive Spirit healthy competitive spirit it's also communicating between the staff and also the students that cloud3d is part of the way they work it might be that they use it for silhouette and crazy shape making that's really sustainability because it can go bigger than they could afford to use color code or want to use you know physical stuff or they might take it all the way through so it is how they actually work through what their design practices and development practice is going to be and not to get overwhelmed but oh it's a big piece of software because it's got lots of functionality because you might just use one particular element of it when you start off and then move on to other areas yeah yeah yeah can I ask a question hello um I have got a couple of questions um one is obviously mum met and I I went to my met back in the day that was my home University when I was undergrad um and obviously you're very far ahead in terms of your use of clothes 3D and digital sampling what are your thoughts of interacting with other possible local universities are you in you know obviously sharing that sort of um that way forward you know obviously some universities are very much in the traditional way of working you know they're a bit afraid of moving forward so in terms of money how would you feel about other universities in the vicinity sort of yeah using you as a guide I I can I can answer that for you um we we are in touch with uh other universities of the UK that have just started their Journey with Khloe and those academics have been in contact with myself and I've obviously been reaching out giving them some help and support with you know how they progress with their Journey we also have some research being undertaken at the moment which is obviously uh charting and recording uh I suppose uh the changes in in education that need to take place in response to what's happening in the fashion industry and those changes so that that information will be published shortly and that will obviously give I suppose other institutes other users um a good understanding of the I suppose the benefits of pitfalls and what to do to actually move forward with these Technologies if you want to get with me afterwards uh I can look back for further information and I'll also share that research when it's completed through through obviously close while I think that would be really interesting and thank you that's a really nice question um so so yeah please do get in touch I will do thank you very much there was a question was it from you as well um Jenny um yes we do use um I guess lecturers as well that are working in Industry well and we do that whether it's clone 3D or anything else um in terms of your master's program your level seven obviously you talk a lot about the hybrid hybrid working and you know use of um Miniatures how much in terms of like their um applications how do they have to have done a undergrad in fashion so they have to have pattern cutting experience or is it like something that you would teach straight from the at level seven level it depends on which um particular um one they're doing so the one that I gave an example of today was the ma fashion design and technology which is a natural extension of our undergrad fashion design and Technologies at menswear women's wear and sports where however students may not have studied um in the same way or they might have done a business degree or geography or whatever but um it's set up so that they can explore so when I mentioned my product process Etc methods they can explore their own work in different ways so we had one particular as an example one particular student who had actually been a designer in industry but then had moved into management and strategy so she wasn't interested in designing what she was interested in how Cloe could be used strategically to communicate new Concepts so um we get a wide variety of students coming in and we help them decide how they're going to position and work with whatever technologies that they are whether it's Cloud 3D or anything else does that does that help no absolutely it doesn't make sense because obviously the big thing for me as a lecturer is that like the extension of learning color 3D and we were talking about this um new like being a a um like a new sort of way of Designing like you're a bit of your product developer you're a garment Tech you are a um a designer you know so it's it's making us being able to go into different aspects and like you said starting off I think you're going to be one thing and then coming out I'm thinking to another with traditional fashion courses it's like you have to learn how to do pattern cutting you have to know how to like make an actual sample and I think it's really cool that there's an expansion of of opportunities in the industry you know and I think that's you know obviously I'm I'm a bit I'm a bit of a geek about it I'm really excited about it so yeah hearing all this level let's connect and talk as well yes I'm like-minded and we are lucky with our and you know and Adrian as well that's on here as well he he has the same sort of approach that it is hybrid and it's about learning what um students are going to take with them of course at undergrad level there are certain things that they have to learn to come out with a fashion design and Technology um program um of studying but at Master's level of course it's it is much more personalized and we have the ability to do that but the learning outcomes are succinct enough but broad enough to help them explore what that means for them so yeah I get a bit geeky too and also just to let you know I'm not too far away and I'm actually come from salfords I studied itself but years ago I've um started in November so I've come from Chester University's a very local so yes I could probably kind of connect yes because we've got we've got staff that um that have colleagues at IX colleagues and friends at Salford as well so yeah feel free to connect and go across there every day yeah that is that is actually amazing I mean I would love for you all to connect and exchange with each other and um so we would love either you had the chance to note down the email addresses of Anita Jane and Adrian or you leave us your email address in the chat and we'll make sure to connect you and and give you the email addresses later so you can also direct any questions that comes up later on um so please feel free to do that because I think think and sharing is everything and we can learn so much from each other um and yeah I think we have to look a little bit at the time but I I really uh thank you for um bringing your questions up and and it already gave me the idea that you guys really should share more with each other and we are happy that we gave somehow this opportunity today um to make this a little bit possible just a little bit but hopefully you connect later on um so yeah there's email addresses coming in great um I'm gonna uh I'd like to to end this session today because we are running out a little bit of time and um thank you again um to Anita left but thanks to Anita Adrian and Jane for um for staying here and also answering all these questions and um being also open to to be contacted later on yeah well thank you thank you very much for the opportunity sorry my voice is going on um thank you for the opportunity um today and it's lovely to to have so many people on and hopefully just connect with us if you've got any questions we'll be happy to to share thankful thank you so much have a lovely rest of the day everybody bye bye everyone bye ",
        "Summary": "# Comprehensive Guide to Implementing CLO 3D in Fashion Education ## Introduction This guide covers the insights and practices shared by Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU) during a session on the incorporation of CLO 3D software into their curriculum. CLO 3D is a leading fashion design software that enables users to create 3D garment prototypes. The session was hosted by Natalie, a Business Development Manager at Khloe Europe, and featured presentations from several faculty members from MMU, including Anita Mitchell, Adrian Thornton, Mary Aspinall, and Jane Meakin. ## Overview of Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU) - **Location**: Munich, Germany - **Enrollment**: Approximately 34,000 students with a strong international alumni network spanning over 170 countries. - **Focus Areas**: - Fashion and textiles research, ranked 6th in the UK. - Sustainability, ranked 1st in the UK for sustainability in universities. - **Facilities**: The Manchester Fashion Institute features digital studios, immersive studios, and cutting-edge resources supported by experienced technical teams. ## Implementing CLO 3D into the Curriculum ### Step 1: Introduction of 3D Prototyping - **Initial Adoption**: Nearly 20 years ago, MMU began incorporating 3D prototyping into their curriculum, focusing on technical innovation in fashion. - **Digital Strategy**: Developed a strategy to integrate digitalization into the curriculum to address industry challenges. ### Step 2: Staff Training and Development - **Training Programs**: Ongoing training for academic staff to ensure they are proficient in CLO 3D and understand its pedagogical implications. - **Pedagogical Understanding**: Emphasis on how to effectively teach and utilize the software in the classroom. ### Step 3: Hybrid Learning Models - **Hybrid Smart Framework**: A teaching model that combines physical and digital learning experiences. - **Student Engagement**: Encouragement for students to practice both digitally and physically, fostering flexibility and adaptability. ### Step 4: Collaborative Projects - **Interdisciplinary Collaboration**: Engaging with industry partners and collaborating with other educational institutes to enhance learning and create real-world applications. - **International Projects**: Example includes a collaboration with the Beijing Institute of Fashion Technology, showcasing how CLO 3D can facilitate cross-cultural design projects. ## Key Insights from Faculty Presentations ### Anita Mitchell (Head of Fashion Section) - **Curriculum Development**: Implementing CLO 3D helps students develop sustainable fashion products. - **Real-World Applications**: Students learn to create digital twins and understand fabric performance characteristics. ### Adrian Thornton (Senior Lecturer) - **Hybrid Learning**: Developed a framework that combines traditional pattern-making with digital techniques. - **Student Testimonials**: Encouraged students to engage in both digital and physical garment creation, leading to successful placements in industry roles. ### Mary Aspinall (3D Prototyping Technician) - **Sustainable Practices**: Focus on zero-waste designs and using CLO 3D to optimize fabric usage. - **Support for Students**: One-on-one guidance to ensure accurate fit and performance in garment creation. ### Jane Meakin (Senior Lecturer) - **Master's Level Curriculum**: Encouraging critical thinking and experimentation with CLO 3D. - **Diverse Student Backgrounds**: Students from various backgrounds are supported in exploring different aspects of fashion design. ## Tips and Tricks for Implementing CLO 3D 1. **Start Small**: Begin with basic functionalities of CLO 3D, gradually introducing more complex features as students become comfortable. 2. **Create a Community**: Establish online platforms for staff and students to share experiences, resources, and designs. This encourages collaboration and motivation. 3. **Bite-Sized Learning**: Encourage daily practice in small increments rather than overwhelming sessions; this helps maintain motivation and retention. 4. **Foster Interdisciplinary Collaboration**: Connect with colleagues from different departments or institutions to broaden perspectives and share resources. 5. **Use Real-World Examples**: Incorporate industry projects and case studies into the curriculum to contextualize learning. 6. **Emphasize Sustainability**: Focus on how digital prototyping can lead to more sustainable practices in fashion design. 7. **Encourage Critical Thinking**: Foster an environment where students can question traditional practices and explore innovative solutions using CLO 3D. ## Conclusion Incorporating CLO 3D into fashion education presents an exciting opportunity for students to adapt to the rapidly evolving fashion industry. By following the structured implementation approach outlined in this guide, educators can create a dynamic learning environment that equips students with the necessary skills to succeed in both digital and physical realms of fashion design.

        "Transcript": "  hi everyone I'd like to introduce myself I'm Natalie I'm a business development manager at Khloe based out of Munich Germany and I'm very happy today to welcome you to our second academic month we already did an academic month last year and we're happy to do it again because this month is dedicated to academics with schools and universities showcasing how they have implemented Khloe in their curriculums and today I have the pleasure to host Alessandra montanaro from IED in Italy Torino and I'm very excited to see all the different projects her students worked on and learned more about the positive impact of Khloe within their studies and but before I head over to Alessandra I just do a quick intro of the next 45 minutes so Alessandra is going to Showcase her um her projects and what she does with Khloe and afterwards we're gonna do a 50 minutes q a session where everyone has the possibility to send us questions in the chat and let us know if they're curious about something else and um yeah so let's now introduce Alessandra welcome Alessandra um it's really a pleasure um I learned about you that you've been a program leader and teacher at IED Torino for quite some years now but you also um gained experience as a consultant for international companies so it's really a pleasure for us to join um for us that you joined today and you will learn more from your side so um please feel free to take over now and present thank you very much nasty it's a pleasure to be here thanks for the invitation and today I want to show you what we do with floater D in EAD I really love 3D in fashion so I'm very happy to be here today because I know I'm in the right place first of all let me introduce you what is it Eid Eid it's an Italian University that has more than 15 years of experience in the designer areas so not only fashion design but also Transportation design product design Visual Arts communication so every area of design and creativity Eid hits the network so we have different school around Italy Spain in Brazil for Eid is very important the method based on learning by doing that means that our students must learn how to prepare a project in the app to check it step by step with our teacher that are not only academic but are professional people so they they improve their work to become more professional for us the project culture is very important and our students must learn how to use a cultural inspiration and how to use the the technical skill to prepare a professional project we work often closely to company and that's an interesting part of our job because we plan often projects with company that come to our classroom giving a briefing to our student so that they can learn the real needs of the of a brand who I am I'm uh and uh I'm the program leader and teacher for a baccalaure in fashion design in Eid Torino touring I'm also the program leader and teacher of a postgraduate course about glutathy in aad Torino I'm a fashion designer with a good experience in Italy and in other countries like China Brazil and I've been graduated in EAD and it's quite a long time I'm teach in Eid so today I will talk about what we do in Eid Torino with the use of cloud 30. we start to use the cloud 30 in 2016. so at this time there was a cultural D version number three and now we have a version number seven so it's quite long time and it was not easy to find someone that can help us and to teach the software to our student so I decided to to learn by myself thanks to Prisma Tech how to use the software and to teach it to our students here you can see uh the the Eid to Reno courses that are using productivity so we have a bachelor in fashion design is a clear course and we use the 3D at the second year it's a 40 hour course and this is the first level of the users so how to use productive and then we use it at the third year it's again a 40 hour course and we go deeper in the use of growth ready to prepare the graduation project of our students there is a second course again a bachelor in the gallery and accessory design it's again a three-year course and the students learn at the second year with the course of 20 hour how to develop accessories with growth strategy and then there is a postgraduate course included it's a 19-hour course it's about class routine so it's open to everyone they want to learn how to use the software and so there are people with fashion design background or graphic design background or they are pattern making a pattern maker and they have to know they have to learn how to use growth ready in fashion and accessories how we work with Cloud 3D I always say with to my student that there are three fundamental steps in the use of growth ready so the first one is the productization the second one is the proto-customization and the third one is the communication of the project about the creation of the 3D Proto the first step is to learn the difference between 2D and 3D and they have to learn that the 3D part the 2D part is the pattern and so we teach to our students how to create a pattern into 3D how to modify it and also the the special instruments are inside of the 3D like internet shape Baseline they have to learn how to use it after that they have to understand how to stitch a pattern and how to create a special effects like padding splits and all the details are needing a clothes uh about the 3D area is very important they they learn how to arrange the factor in the 3D area how to create for the arrangement and more than that they have to learn the use of the simulation that is the the special instrument of this software because it shows you how the digital fabric fall down by the gravity after uh this first step you you get a white cloth the white product and you have to to put your creativity and to customize it so uh it's uh we teach to our student how to create a correct all over print how to create a correct artwork to add incubatory the use of the maps that are very important to to give the photorealistic feeling uh or at the product how to use the stop stitches and all the details like bathroom trims zipper piping so everything is in a closed uh I can I I always say to my student that that part is like a digital artisanal work because you must know uh Ariel clothes correctly to to to do a good job but I can also tell you that the younger generation are really digital and I can see that they often understand the real side of the work thanks to the use of the software for them is much more easy to to to understand it after that is very important the communication of the project because our student has a strong concept at the start of the project and they have to learn how to express it thanks to the software and so we teach to them how to use the colorway to create color combo how to customize Avatar how to create animation so that they can show the Warner effect of our Proto and they must keep in mind the technical side so they they must learn how to use the schematic render and after that they they they learn how to save in a resolution and how to create a good image with the render is inside of cloth ready so they must decide and choose the right light the right shot as if they will do a photo photo shooting in the reality to explain you what we do I think the best way is to show you what our students do and so as I told you at The Bachelor of fashion design they start to learn the use of Lottery during the second year it's the first level but we always plan a project with company with friends so that they can work on both sides here for example you can see a project for QA QA came to our classroom and asked our students to think in their collection library and so yeah for example you can see the sketches of Sarah salvio and the world she has been done to present to them air 3D Pro too that's another work about that is a work from Aminata diopa and in this project I think it's interesting because I'm inada Creator a proto-sample but also she showed a Proto and e-commerce page of the brand and they really appreciate it because this is something some brands are starting to doing and so is an interesting point of view that's another project of another student the company is duera that produce zipper and they ask to our students to think in a new user of their product and so you can see the sketch of the espartini and then she has been work on on the Avatar customization and to create different color combo and in to express the meditates of our project here in the technical in in in the technical way and in a shooting that's again another project for a brand rudiger then it's an Italian brand and this project from Julia gladio and she create those still life um this still life and she used it to explain to the brand her idea in the collection more than this and in The Bachelor of fashion design we work with the student of the third year for the graduation project so we go deep in the use of Lottery and the graduation project is an important project for our student they must create a collection of 25 outfits and they must realize some of the outfit and in that sense clusterity is very helpful because they work with the pattern maker but at the same times they test their pattern include 3D and so it's very helpful for them to work on import side we always get good result on this project but since we are coming from the graduation days I want to show you uh the last project the project so the project of the student of this year this is the project from Gabriel valaguera and it's a standard really passionate about growth ready he decided to create all the collection include 3D and here you can see the image of his collection and here you can see on the right a shot of our animation we create to to give the feeling of the collection but at the same times the technical part they they have to keep in mind because they they they know they have to they they need the process they they have to uh they need the possibility to explain to pattern maker and tailor the detail of their collection yeah another shaft of uh Gabriel so they work in a Warner effort and still life and this is another project from a student called noimir chardetto she has been working about childhood and as you can see in the left side the our student has a strong concept and she represented in a sketches but she was also playing a lot with a shooting in cloth ready she creates a puppet Irma sport called Tommy and also she she worked in everything like bags glasses shoes and she also made some animation of that so it's uh it's a really interesting project and they always keep in mind the technical side so they have to show the detail they have to express it in in the correct way that's another project of another student at Giovanni Marquette personally I really love this image in amazing included the project of Germany it's about all the moments of our sleeping and I think that create an image like this you must be brave because after a long walk into 3D is quite interesting image and so here you can see all the sketches of Giovanni and the photo shooting and you can see that our student must take care of all the details so the materials the concept of the shooting everything must Express the their idea that's another student Matilda Maino Mateos is really passionate about knitwear and pattern making and so it was working a lot in on on the pattern to create those kind of volume and effort on his jacket and the ear there is the shooting material Creator and I think that there is a ticket is quite good deaths and other students and he has a philosophic inspiration based on the theory of Michelle tuko in the side he decided to express it in a man's Revelation in the year you can see his research and here there are two shots of two animation Samuel create for his product more than this as I told you we have a course for post-graduate it's a course about Cloud 3D and so there are fashion designer graphic design a pattern making the pattern maker they want to learn how to use the 3D and so everyone every student is trying to use the the software in a good way to express their work this for example is a project of Bianca caparini and she is investigating the the the world of maintavers so she decided to use a genie Avatar and she ambiented all her projects inside of the metaverse that's another student Vanessa would see what you can see are closed by made by Pro 30 but she concentrate herself in a photorealistic effort of every teacher and she take care a lot about all the details and this is veramikyan she is a designer specialized in kids work and menswear so where I is using now to 3D for a representing and so she concentrated herself in to express all the detail so that she can explain it easier to her customer then there is a course about jewelry and accessory design and the student useful 3D during the second year to develop the some accessories so soft accessory because they they work on the gallery Glass glasses and bags shoes and wallets they worked especially in soft accessories luckily our students really liked to work with Pro 3D and a lot of them worked now with spirituality and you are just some example of students that are working um with clutterity and on that I'm very happy for them and also I I'm happy because some of them like Irene repeto she's trading specialist specialist at masmara and another student is not in that page that works at pattern that is uh in important manufacturer in Italy they became micro league so they are teacher now and so that's that's good because we are a big family in that sense and to pre-ended this presentation I want also to give you a good news is not yet in this presentation because we just have the confirmation last week and um from the next year we will start with a new course I will be the program leader and teacher for the personality part but it's a course called Advanced 3D fashion and we will work on on the use of productive for the close side but I will work close to a 3D artist and so that we can work especially on Avatar and render outside of the 3D so the course will start in January and we are excited for that thank you thank you so much Alessandra and now I'm also excited to see that you are building even a new course so um but first of all thanks for bringing all these great examples to our attention and see how your students really benefited from from using Khloe in their projects and how this could be inspiring um also to others um it's really inspiring to me to see these great young talents using Khloe um so for everyone who is with us in the session today um do you have some questions for Alessandra would you like to raise some questions then please feel free to type them in the chat or um if you may you can also raise your hand and get um and express yourself directly to us is there something for you while maybe someone thinks of a question they have I wonder I have a question for you Alessandra so this new course and you work with a 3D artist so I'm guessing it means that for you it's getting important to also use um Chloe and and teach how the assets can be used after design is that true or how did you come up with this course why is it important for you now uh we have seen that we we start to use growth trading quite well and so we we want to explore the software that can work together with Lottery and so we decided to plan this new course because uh we can see that we can express something about Avatar and also to get more realistic effort and ambient with other software so that's why we want to prove that because the fashion system is always running and so we're great great very excited to then also learn in a year maybe um like what you gained from the course or what does keep the students gain from the course so let's keep in touch about it okay yeah so we have a question in the chat the question from Fran is do the students develop their own patterns on Khloe or do they work with pattern makers and then import them to clothes both it depends on the first level we usually start with uh already made pattern and we teach to our students how to modify it but for the graduation project it's different because they they they need to get there exactly the result they want so as it happened for pattern making you can start from a base and then you can modify it and so they work both include 3D and sometimes if they they have some questions they ask to the pattern maker and so um Bots from real and digital right I guess it's like in the real world also here we see that companies um sometimes they have pattern makers in-house and then they they do that or sometimes it is also a little bit more done by the designer great also another question is do the students work with other 3D software a part of claw also in your courses uh in The Bachelor of fashion designer you know because cloud3d is the current software for efficient designer so that's the the way about the Bachelor of novellery and accessories yes they work with Rhino and also other software I don't know exactly at the moment okay there's another software question so which software will you use um in tandem for rendering out with Khloe we at the moment we use uh the song The render is inside of productivity that is very good uh you can get good image and so what you have seen today is made inside for the future as I told you there will be a new course and we are trying to concentrate ourselves on open sources software because we think it's much more easiest for facial designer or other designer that already use a software like property if they can improve they serve in this way okay great I think the next question I'm from Flavia is is it can follow up quite well it's um so she says thank you first of all and also the question is are you researching with the students the possibilities within the growing ecosystem of digital fashion so let's say made a verse digital assets nfts utility of digital fashion this is uh interesting question of course we are investigating the the metaverse of course with 3D it is something that 3D is something that you can use on on that sense in the reality we are trying to to work in a professional way in in fashion design so that means that you can use your 3D in a company or if you want you can use in metaverse so that's our point yeah yeah I think there is always there's still a lot um to come in the Middle Earth and everyone like does research and trying out if that is something that is going to be even more important so very interested that you are also researching in and figuring out but yeah cool um one more question um so it's about um the graduation project do the students in their graduation project um when develop developing a collection have to present their designs and Claw or is that still optional for them no no they had to present it is part of the briefing so they have to present a 25 outfit collection they have to realize uh three or six outfit and so they have to create the real patterns teach it often they stitch by their self the clothes so it's a important part of the work and they have to create a presentation included and they are also to create a photo shooting of the real clothes so often we work together with the full rear photo shooting and the cloth ready photo shooting because it's important they express they Concept in the correct way right so they also learn again the digital but in the analog way and then you see also the differences and also the strength of both ways I guess I mean yeah exactly oh the next question is not so much directly only about clothes um so do you have any teaching tips that you learn along the way in terms of intro instruction methods sorry okay and before of the start of the presentation I was talking with Natalie and I say to her that the use of a software is something that is you you you can improve yourself trying to use a software so don't be scared I need to try and to make a pattern even if it's something very strange but that's really important in in the in the learning process so it's simply a file and if it doesn't work you don't waste fabric you it's just to try and to to check after that it's a software and so when you start to learn how to use it you will see that with the healthy of your thinking you will get the results you want that's amazing I really would have loved to be a student with you because you encourage your students to just you know try out and also get learnings from experience I really like that um okay there's one more question um that's a really interesting one because it's about our other product closet so the students do the students work with closet in the course as well they started this year because because it is quite new and so as I told you we we started with version number three it's uh in that sense I think as this uh interesting because um we learned some instruments in different way and this whole so help sometimes and to solve some problem and I think a closet is a good opportunity and so the students are are starting to use this this instrument too great great yeah I think closet is really a product of ours that helps to communicate 3D assets also for people who might not be able to open and close software so I think it could be really also valuable for sharing projects among the clients within one porous School okay so one more question no thank you Alessandra for sharing your students work with us it's just one more comment it's okay thank you um um okay there is also another thank you and also an interesting question we are starting to employ um close VD teaching within our curriculum what is the biggest impact flow has on students creative and Technical practice in particular the merging of digital and Hands-On methodologies it's very important because they are a very digital generation and so I can see that with the use of pro3d they they often understand the real process the first year we work in the real way so they have to learn how to sketch how to create a pattern and on the second year we moved to a more digital site and I have to tell you that it's very helpful for them because it's a the year understand me easily great that's good that's really amazing to hear well um I think there is um maybe no more questions I would have a question uh if you if you're allowing to quickly jump in here um thank you so much that was a great presentation Alessandra it's super beautiful to see how how creative those projects are um I saw that you worked together with a lot of Brands and have a lot of student projects there so I would be interested in how you are supporting students after finishing the program in maybe getting into the industry and working together with Brands then is that already internship based or is it working students and that process would interest me a lot sure sure we have a good office that is a career service and the third year our students are helped by this office in to find opportunity and so um into to be in contact with company and so they work on their curriculum on their portfolio so that they can start to to every interview with a different company and luckily the graduation day has been uh one week ago and some of our students already get some opportunities so that's that's good okay awesome cool thank you you're welcome well and one more thing I I am very happy to share it's a comment rather than a question and that um Giancarlo um said that a third of their students who did a close course got an internship immediately after the course and that's really really amazing to hear for us because I mean that's what we are aiming for that um schools like IED and Alessandra and everyone who teaches Khloe really brings into new Experts of 3D prototyping into the industry so thank you for sharing that amazing okay well I guess um our time is almost over so um I'd like to thank um everyone and also especially as some Alessandra for bringing all these great examples along today and also inspiring us about your students work and how you implement it and work for quite a long time I feel like you started 2016 so you already use claw within your curriculum for quite a long time and um we are happy that you shared all your experience today so thank you again for the opportunity yes thank you so much and yeah um so for everyone who wants to maybe get in contact with Alessandra she said she would be happy to share her contact later on so feel free to

maybe talk soon another time sure ",
        "Summary": "# Comprehensive Guide Based on the Transcript ## Introduction This comprehensive guide is based on a webinar hosted by Natalie, a Business Development Manager at Khloe, featuring Alessandra Montanaro from IED (Istituto Europeo di Design) in Torino, Italy. The session focuses on how Khloe, a 3D fashion design software, is integrated into academic curriculums, particularly in fashion design. ## Agenda Overview 1. Introduction by Natalie 2. Presentation by Alessandra Montanaro on IED's use of Khloe 3. Q&A session with participants ## Step-by-Step Instructions ### 1. Introduction to Khloe - **What is Khloe?** Khloe is a 3D design software that aids in the fashion design process, allowing students to create, visualize, and communicate their designs digitally. ### 2. Overview of IED - **What is IED?** IED is an Italian university specializing in design and creativity, offering programs in fashion design, transportation design, product design, and visual arts. ### 3. Curriculum Integration - **Course Structure:** - **Bachelor in Fashion Design:** - Year 2: Introduction to Khloe (40 hours) - Year 3: Advanced use of Khloe for graduation projects (40 hours) - **Bachelor in Accessories Design:** - Year 2: Introduction to Khloe for accessory development (20 hours) - **Postgraduate Course:** - 19-hour course on Khloe for various design backgrounds. ### 4. Fundamental Steps in Using Khloe - **Three Key Steps:** 1. **Productization:** Understanding the difference between 2D and 3D design, creating patterns, and using 3D tools. 2. **Proto-Customization:** Customizing designs, including colorways, prints, and details like trims and zippers. 3. **Communication of the Project:** Using Khloe’s tools to create presentations, animations, and photorealistic images to convey design concepts. ### 5. Student Projects - **Project-Based Learning:** Students work on real-world projects in collaboration with brands, applying their skills learned in Khloe to design collections, prototypes, and e-commerce representations. ### 6. Technical Skills Development - **Learning Approach:** Students are taught to work with existing patterns initially, moving towards creating their own patterns for graduation projects, emphasizing hands-on learning alongside digital methods. ## Definitions - **Productization:** The process of taking a concept and turning it into a marketable product. - **Proto-Customization:** The customization of prototype designs to meet specific requirements or tastes. - **3D Simulation:** A feature in Khloe that allows designers to visualize how fabrics will behave in real life. ## Tips and Tricks - **Encourage Experimentation:** Students should be encouraged to experiment with patterns in Khloe without fear of making mistakes, as this is part of the learning process. - **Utilize the Software’s Features:** Familiarize students with all tools within Khloe, including fabric simulation and rendering options, to enhance their design capabilities. - **Integrate Real-World Projects:** Collaborate with companies to give students the opportunity to work on real projects, which helps bridge the gap between academic learning and industry requirements. - **Focus on Communication:** Teach students how to effectively present their designs using Khloe’s capabilities for creating professional-looking presentations. ## Conclusion The integration of Khloe into the curriculum at IED has proven beneficial for students, allowing them to develop both creative and technical skills essential for the fashion industry. By combining hands-on training and digital proficiency, students are well-prepared to enter the workforce as skilled professionals.

        "Transcript": "hi my name is phoebe and today i'm going to walk you through all fabric types that can only be shown in the render window so let's jump on in and have some fun while we learn so here we have our 3d window i already have my uh interactive render window open and ready and i have my um 3d window over here now the first thing we're going to do is we're going to go over our fur render only option now before we get into this there's just a few things i'd like to remind us all one if you saw the video before this we went over all uh fabric types about the 3d window also if you saw the video before this part one of fabric types you know that fabric types do not influence the drape of your fabric at all that is the same for render types as well and also as we know with these render only types with with the um 3d window a lot of the changes that were happening were with the reflection the big difference with the render fabric types is yes the reflection changes a bit but also we add in another element sometimes so with fur render only the element that's added in is the for parameters and first shape so for parameters is going to change like the color and look of your fur well for shape we'll change the actual shape of each first strand so you can make it longer thicker the bend the taper all of that stuff that will change like the actual shape of your fur in the next video fabric types part three we're going to do a deep dive into all about how to adjust and change around your fur but in this part we're just going to focus on how the reflection has been added in for fur in 6.2 and what that will then look like so here with my reflection you now have the ability to adjust it on fur so again i can make my roughness all the way to zero and my reflection intensity all the way up to 100 and you'll see this adjustment here in your 3d window once i hit interactive in my render window you'll see that change as well so now you can start to see how reflection has added in a different look to the fur and everything so here we have our fur types and we have it for a hundred and zero all the way to zero and one hundred and you can see how with this reflection it will adjust it now let's move on to gem so i'm going to move over here to our gem now one quick thing is one of my best practices whenever i'm doing fabric types and changing things around is i like to keep my render window constantly at stop and once i adjust all the fabric type to what i like then i hit interactive also another thing to remember is you don't just have to apply fabric types to fabric fabric tips can be applied to avatars hardware objs all of those types of things um it is not exclusively for fabric at all so now let's click here and i'm going to hit interactive in my type in my render window and you can see here in material type selected general so let's talk a little bit about gem and the differences that you see here so if i scroll down to my gem type you'll see that the reflection has changed yes but we've also added in this other element for our property and it's refraction so you might be asking yourself what's this refraction add in what are all these refraction intensity absorption and abby let me tell you so refraction intensity will decide how cloudy or clear your gem is you kind of want to remember what those three c's for um diamonds and gems are and they kind of work here as well i believe it's like clarity cut and clear i don't i think i think that's it i'm not sure i don't have diamonds i don't go shopping for them either so who knows um but for refraction this is going to decide how quality or clear your gem is absorption is deciding how much that light that's coming in the gem is going to absorb so the higher you go for absorption the more light will absorb which means the darker the gem will then be and abby is going to be the hardest one to kind of understand but i think i made it simple abby's going to measure how much of the how much like the gem inside is reflecting out so if you think about it right you know how diamonds kind of shine even on cloudy days that is the abbey so um the lower the number the more light that will disperse so the more like rainbows you're gonna see inside well the higher the number um the more the clearer it will be so the less rainbows here's a quick science lesson for anybody who wants to know if you think about it with a diamond right diamond light coming into that diamond what happens is based off of how the diamond is cut and the abbey and everything that light is going to hit around inside of that diamond for a certain amount of time and then reflect out the light hitting inside of that diamond that is what the abbey is it's like how bright that will be that will also determine like how many rainbows you see in everything also what we'll be determining is if the light then gets um separated out which was how you see the rainbows or if it stays as one for white light and then you don't see the rainbows that is as much science as we're gonna get into today if you're interested in it more i would suggest researching into it um but that is how i remember it for playing around so let's jump on in and play around with it okay so here we have our refraction let's play around with refraction intensity here we have it all the way at 100 let's see what it'll look like down to 11. this is pretty cloudy let's go back up now absorption is at point zero two let's see what it would be like at five it's starting to absorb it ends let's bump it up to limit again it's starting to absorb it a little bit more in and everything let's go back to 0.2 less absorption and you see the light kind of bouncing off more finally we have our abbey this is at 80. let's see what it would be like at 1. now you start to see those rainbows because the light is separating and it's bouncing around a little bit more at 20 you still kind of see the edge of the rainbow right because it's still separating but you see like this is where it's bouncing around it's going around in a little like square and all the way at 80. and all that so that is gem gems are great to use for when you have like rhinestones or stuff to place onto shirts or any garment really or even any accessory that you want to place onto it it can also be used if you were making jewelry or like home goods or something like that and you wanted to like have gems or something around okay now let's move on to the glass i'm going to hit attractive and select this so here we have our glass render type so here we've got glass now if we look at the added element again it's refraction now this is very similar to what gem was except we don't have the atom we just have refraction intensity and absorption so again if i increase this you'll see that it's going to be a little bit clearer if my absorption goes up to five though you're gonna see that this becomes a lot darker another thing that i want to add here is i've added in a color to my glass based off of how i set up this refraction um intensity and absorption that's going to directly affect how my color looks also the angle in which i view my glass will also be affected so if i lower my absorption down to one you'll start to see the color more but in darker areas like areas where the glass is overlapping closer together you won't see as as much also if i change my angle you'll see how it's affected a little bit more too glass is really great for when you're doing environments and you have windows or when you're maybe making some home goods as well glass is going to be really helpful for you now i'm going to jump back into my fabric i created custom views for this fabric it's going to allow you to quickly jump back and forth to different view points very quickly and easily to get to custom views all you have to do is right click and you can see then custom view okay i'm also going to just switch out the fabric to a nylon matte okay so now we have our name on that and i'm going to hit enter so the next fabric type that we're going to go over is glitter so glitter is really great for when you have like glittery fabrics or also with um graphics and you want to have glitter to that here i'm going to scroll down and you'll see that there's now these this option called glitter parameters so you lay around the color number and saturation so the color here what you can do is you can actually decide what you want these little dots to be you can have them so like they're a similar color or a completely different color if you want i'm just always trying to make sure that they're lighter than the base color you also can decide how many how like any glitter points you want within your fabric i tend to stay between 100 and 300 i find if i go over 300 like 500 maybe it becomes too dense and you don't get to really see the difference as easily so i try to keep it around like three a hundred to three hundred finally the other option you have is your saturation value this is go uh saturation variation this is going to allow you to vary the saturation for glitter so it's just easier to show you if i have one you can see that um each glitter speck is going to have different saturation and everything and you'll see like the colors will change a bit pretty great very glittery yeah okay now let's go into our iridescent option let's scroll down and hit interactive so with our iridescent option again we've got our reflection options which has changed a bit i'm going to make that lower and we also have refraction same things as before you play around here that there's more or less and then also your absorption i tend to just keep this what it is uh it works the best the next option you have here is the iridescence so the first thing is color you have five colors you can actually go in and change these color chips to whatever color you want so sometimes i pick like one u and then i'll do different um levels of that different saturations of that right now though i'm just going to pick different colors and everything maybe this white is gonna be like so you can see that when you play around you get a completely new iridescent look to it the next option you have is roughness now roughness is very similar to what roughness is when it comes to reflection the lower the number the higher the number the more cover uh the more surface area it will cover the light wall well the higher the number the smaller surface area it will cover so right now we're at a smaller number and you can see like each little part is like really bright each little section well as if i went to higher it would be more evenly spread out for the entire coverage i like to keep it lower because i think that works best the next option is view shift this will actually shift your hue over so i can go over here and now i have like green hues instead i can go down here now i've got like some blue purple greenish and everything i can go more in the middle we're gonna get to warmer colors and every and all of that or i could just do zero and it will stay with what i originally had and finally we have the weight option now this option is where the higher you go the more weight the iridescent will have versus the ground color so the iridescent will carry more weight than what your ground color will be it just makes sense when you see it so if i higher the weight here you're going to start to see that the iridescent colors become more prominent and heavier versus the ground color but if i go farther down you start to see more of the brown color and the iridescent is just like a light little highlight kind of pretty cool points and that is iridescent the final options we have go back to our gem and here we also have light so what light does is it just makes that object a light almost it's great for when you have an environment and you want like a light bulb somewhere or anything and you just change that to a light and also we have skin so skin is really important for avatars it actually looks best on this skin is really important for when you have an avatar in your 3d workspace and you want it to look a little bit more realistic you would apply a skin render to it and it will start to look a lot more realistic and everything versus just the fabric mat and all that and these are all of our different rendering types thank you so much for watching i hope you enjoyed this video if you have any questions please post them down below in the comment section one three uh 3d designer will get back to you on it i hope you learned a lot and please don't forget to like and subscribe there's so much great content on this channel that will just help teach you and you'll just learn so much about khloe and be such a pro before you know it thanks again you ",
        "Summary": "# Comprehensive Guide to Fabric Types in 3D Rendering ## Introduction In this guide, we will cover various fabric types and rendering options available in a 3D design software. The focus will be on rendering types that can only be viewed in the render window, emphasizing the unique properties and adjustments for each type. ### Key Definitions - **Render Window**: A workspace where you can see how your 3D models appear with different materials and lighting in real-time. - **Reflection**: The way light bounces off a surface, affecting how shiny or matte it appears. - **Refraction**: The bending of light as it passes through materials, influencing transparency and clarity. - **Absorption**: The amount of light absorbed by a material, affecting its darkness. - **Interactive Render**: A mode that allows you to see real-time updates in the render window as you make adjustments to your materials. ## Step-by-Step Instructions ### 1. Setting Up Your Workspace - **Open the 3D Window**: Ensure you have your 3D workspace open. - **Open the Interactive Render Window**: This will allow you to see changes in real-time. ### 2. Working with Fabric Types #### A. Fur Render Only 1. **Select Fur Render Type**: Choose the fur type from your material options. 2. **Adjust Fur Parameters**: - **Color**: Change the color of the fur. - **Shape**: Customize the length, thickness, bend, and taper of fur strands. 3. **Modify Reflection Settings**: - Set **Roughness** to 0 for shininess. - Adjust **Reflection Intensity** from 0 to 100. - Observe changes in both the 3D window and the render window. #### B. Gem Render Type 1. **Select Gem Material**: Click on the gem type. 2. **Adjust Reflection and Refraction**: - **Refraction Intensity**: Controls clarity (0 = cloudy, 100 = clear). - **Absorption**: Higher values make the gem darker. - **Abbe Value**: Determines light dispersion and rainbow visibility. 3. **Experiment**: - Change values for refraction intensity, absorption, and Abbe to see visual effects. #### C. Glass Render Type 1. **Select Glass Material**. 2. **Adjust Refraction Settings**: - Change **Refraction Intensity** for clarity. - Adjust **Absorption** to see how it darkens the glass. 3. **Color Adjustment**: By changing the angle, observe how the glass color changes. #### D. Glitter Render Type 1. **Select Glitter Material**. 2. **Modify Glitter Parameters**: - **Color**: Set the color of the glitter specks. - **Density**: Adjust the number of glitter points (100-300 recommended). - **Saturation Variation**: Control the saturation of each glitter point. 3. **Preview**: See how different settings affect the glitter's appearance. #### E. Iridescent Render Type 1. **Select Iridescent Material**. 2. **Adjust Settings**: - **Reflection and Refraction**: Similar to previous types. - **Iridescence Colors**: Change up to 5 color chips. - **Roughness**: Adjust for light coverage. - **Weight**: Control the prominence of iridescent colors versus the base color. 3. **Interactive Play**: Experiment with colors and settings to achieve desired effects. #### F. Light and Skin Render Types 1. **Select Light Material**: Use it to simulate lighting within your 3D environment. 2. **Select Skin Material**: Apply to avatars for a realistic look. ### 3. Best Practices - **Keep Render Window at Stop**: Adjust fabric types before entering interactive mode to avoid unnecessary changes. - **Custom Views**: Right-click to create custom views for quick navigation between perspectives. - **Apply to Various Objects**: Remember that fabric types can be applied to avatars, hardware, and more, not just fabric. ### 4. Tips and Tricks - **Fur Adjustments**: For different fur looks, experiment with strand shape and color parameters. - **Gem Clarity**: Use clarity and absorption settings to mimic realistic gem appearances. - **Glitter Density**: Too much density may obscure the fabric beneath, so find a balance. - **Iridescence Effects**: Play with the hue and weight to create striking visuals. ## Conclusion This guide has provided an overview of various fabric types and their unique properties within the 3D rendering environment. By following the outlined steps, you can effectively manipulate and experiment with each material to achieve stunning results in your 3D designs.

        "Transcript": "  hey everyone um so yeah my name is george oliac i'm super pleased to be presenting for you uh today um for institut francais lamotte of the french institute for fashion which is a pretty big fashion school uh set up in paris um so i'm as you said uh i'm gonna be joined by julia also uh afterwards uh who has a bit of a flight delay he is um in charge of processes uh and uh he's the technology expert within the french institute for fashion and i'm the trainer um so i help students get creative with the software and i'm of course keen on sharing about education in general and what we do at ifm for um for close 3d uh i'm going to do a bit of um explanation about the the different things we do at ifm because ifm is not only a fashion school it's also a fashion observatory and we uh so we have contacts with the professionals um and so afterwards i will be presenting the way my course is um organized and also some students work uh so the first thing we we've been envisioning is the strategy behind like what's happening right now in the industry and the way khloe sees the future uh really looks like the way ifm envisions it uh with a different set of tools and of course close 3d is is central within that um and so um we've uh we have other partners uh of course that have uh helped us uh envision the future we've got premier vision which is as you may know the the biggest fabric fair in the world they're set up in paris um twice a year uh and we've been discussing with them different problematics and then how we can virtualize materials how we can store them uh and that's very interesting to have a conversation with this uh leader in terms of um um fabric sourcing uh then we've got discussions with uh substance petty battle uh is one of the major brands we have discussions with uh regarding uh how to imagine the the range plan of the future um we've got a couple of trials with which is a leather bag i imagine you all know about it um brand uh and also drastics um so we cannot talk much about dress what's happening with drastics but we also have experiments with them and discussions um and so the way we've been um imagining the the workshops was to start with so i started two years ago with a master's degree and i still teach the the masters um with a 20 hours workshop so it takes the shape of a workshop uh and we teach both uh ready to wear students and accessory design so ready to wear includes menswear women square and knitwear and then accessories too and so they all get a 20 hours training and we split the class so that they can experience the software in a more specific way um what else now we've got a training uh organized also for the bachelor degrees since this year which is great because then we'll have students that are already um used to the software so this is the view of the entrance we got a newly restored building uh facing the river so it's a very nice setup and a big computer room so i i think teaching in different places uh i have to say teaching in such an environment is really cool because then you you get to really show that this modern process of designing with cloth 3d is not about uh being hidden uh in a you know small computer room but rather something open on the rest of the of the building and i think it has definitely an influence in the way students envision the the digital uh fashion class um so for our ma students this is a bit of um of a sum up of what we provide the students with uh so they have the free license available uh from the computer room uh and they have um a big we try to emphasize on creativity uh i will let julia explain more when it's coming over uh for this slide and i will jump straight to my course uh so i split the course in three parts which um are i think greatly inspired by the training i had the chance to receive from cloth reading 3d a few years ago um at adidas because i used to work for adidas as a designer and i had total three weeks of training with khloe um jumping from different teams and always having them coming from munich to uh herzegovina and um and so i saw the great teaching energy that was there and uh having the chance to teach now at ifm i tried to bring a little bit of that um and so we start with discovering the software um which means discovering the controls and the navigation in the 3d space through a gamified interface with like pre-made games that allow students to to just discover the tool and i try to not put a big uh emphasize on the tools themselves because there's so many just want them to understand what each and every tool can do and then once they understand the logic they can jump to another to if they want to go further but the the most important time most important factor for me in discover is really to give um how would you say to give a taste for the software and how fun it is to use it and then we we jump directly into the create section where we uh actually start designing usually i advise my students to start with uh the configurator because it allows them to um they've been experiencing suing already with the discover part and then they it's gonna allow them to just create something that looks almost like the the idea they have in mind without knowing the software much and uh as we have a bit more than 20 hours together we have to jump uh pretty fast into the the creation process if i want to make sure my students can output an interesting result uh out of these uh um 20 hours and then the last part is about sharing um so sharing is in i see sharing in two different ways the first one is to print the the patterns with the tracer that we provide in school so we learn how to place the patterns within the layout mode and to export it as a plt clutter file so that it works out with our ipsun tracer and the second part is about rendering so we learn how to export and render so of course it's not a huge emphasize on that side of things but if they want to go further um they at least have a taste of what it is and they can just um jump a bit more like div type once the training is over so yeah this is summing up uh a bit um the way i split my course um and also so we've got the computer room next to it uh which uh is like right in the middle so people get the chance also to see by the window uh from other classes and the school is very open so you can just like sneak in and see um what's being done um i'd like also to talk about the tools we provide to our students because we have uh we are equipped with a fab lab and so we try to make links between what we learn in cloth really and the fab lab that is uh provided by the school in which you can find so the tracer is in the close 3d room but then you've got you've got 3d printing machines you've got a trotec laser cutting machine which is uh great i think because then they can uh if they're lazy uh i'll put the patterns directly from the trotec and i can give them a training uh about that and then we also have a direct garment printer so you just put t-shirts or different pieces of fabric within the machine and you can like just print directly on a t-shirt but most importantly we've got a sublimation inkjet printer pretty large one so you can actually place prints or do all of the prints within cloth3d then learn how to export them and do your print within the fablabs which is great because then they get a vision of what end-to-end uh manufacturing could look like within their studies and then of course as we are a fashion school we've got value sewing machine knitting machine embroidery machines um we've got also a computerized uh um i think it's a shawl a knitting machine which is great because then they they can also experiment with that and as i teach also the the knitwear students uh we see a lot of uh of links between what we learn within klo and and also this uh computerized uh the knitting process um so first just before jumping to the student's work i'd like to emphasize the fact that even though we recognize at ifm that uh the um the industry is changing and there's a big interest in teaching close 3d uh for that reason um what we want to drive the attention on is uh how close really is a great creation tool and how it can be used as a medium uh to uh just create 3d shapes without even having to do draping on a dummy a physical draping so we try to really give a new uh call to their guitar in a way and and to just like allow them to experiment with that without um saying this the rest is over and and the past uh tools that we that you've learned uh are not available anymore but it's just if you're more comfortable with creating digitally there's a room for it within the school and we provide you with the tool and uh so there's also another course that we give the students which is a rhino course so they also can design uh solid materials that they can then import so we try to organize this training a bit before clo3d so that we can have the chance to then import the trims and materials and patterns that they create within this software and then yeah play with it uh so one thing i've done is i've uh requested my students to look for a picture that one class would share and um and then i've been doing a part of the job myself i said i'm gonna just uh post the avatar exactly like that picture and then i share the post um the post z project with them if you are familiar with the set project uh within cloud 3d uh so they have the avatar and they can just put the clothing on the avatar and then we've got uh the ability to just address the same picture with that process uh so every student so it's a master one student class uh and each and everyone can express whatever they want and i just let them express freely uh what garment they want to create and i have to say i think it makes a bit of a difference with the rest of the classes um not that it's restricted but then sometimes they can just go a complete direction to the collection they are starting to prepare in their design in their main design class or they can just design the continuity of that and and just uh have a more um solid offer to show um so yeah fur big fur uh also a bit more like a medieval touch with velvet so you see that's all uh rendered uh and there's a bit of photoshop involved so once we render it we render it with the light modes uh on the avatar so that we can remove quite easily uh in uh photoshop the the avatar and then we just put the picture underneath and it's and it's done uh this is the women's square wear class ma12 so they've been experimenting with different uh dressing inflation um also a bit of a medieval touch in here uh so i'm not just focusing too much on this work but it's uh yeah i think it's it's great also as a teacher to bring some guidance and to drive them to um all output the same results in a way like to express themselves creatively but since it's still to have one picture that uh puts the same uh kind of a link between the different projects because i consider still them as a class and not as a group of individuals um yeah so i'm just gonna yeah finish the different picture i'm of course ready to go further with that and then i'd like to just show you quickly a video we've done so this is with the software called twin motion i don't know if some of you are familiar with it so it's by unreal engine and uh by um no i forgot the name of the company that bought it maybe someone can help me but uh i mean twin motion is a path tracing software so we can import within a scene different products uh from the students and then uh create a path trace a traced view of their work it's kind of a digital museum where they can look at what they've done during the year and and we can exhibit in a digital way the work of every of the students so i think next year we'll try to push a bit more that and to offer the students an opportunity to just uh navigate within the space and maybe to make it available to other students to uh drive some traction around the digital class um yeah so it's cool because you can also experiment with the lighting and for uh universities the software is free so you can just export from cloud and then import it within twin motion for free so if if there's any other student around any other teacher around know that it's a yeah free cost and it's a great tool and then i'd like to finish with um one of my students uh agata that did a great job with um with cloth3d so she's been uh creating um so i tend to follow my students after the class on on instagram and then it's great because you keep in touch and um i've seen a project that's that she created called parallel 3.0 which i love um and so it's a digital brand that allows you to see um one product within different uh metaviruses in a way so she's been doing it for animal crossing for uh sensa and uh the central land and it's it's just a great idea i think and uh she said to me that the the close 3d class inspired us her to uh also um go in that direction she of course went a lot further by documenting what software needed what and then uh putting it online uh but i think it's a good kickstarter to uh to have this uh digital class and then and see how amazing uh things you can do with it and and you can build a storytelling around it so i i wanted to share that uh with you guys and so you can follow her on instagram of course pilots 3.0 and um uh what else did i wanted to say yeah so i think um i think that's it like really thank you for uh for listening and i'm ready of course to answer any question   part of of adidas this company is insanely open on on uh sharing with the with the the design community and um and i've been giving trainings within adidas and it was always very chill always in um in a fab lab environment uh we were in an italian we would just like play some music and i tried to to keep doing that with my students to show that it's a pleasurable moment and um and that we are here to just uh create in a very positive way um and yeah one thing i've not been sharing is the the the emphasize we do in uh with the sustainability and inclusivity so we also tell them that these are the values that we want to share with them   learning that software so we try to really teach them different shapes different like how to to dress different body type uh different skin colors uh and also um try to save some fabric because i mean the cotton we use uh to drape in fashion schools is is wasting quite a lot of water i believe and um if we can just change just a tiny bit from from the moment they learn so that they can bring that in within the professional world that's a great thing we've got a sustainability chair within the school and so students get the chance to meet specialists and really um think of of uh sustainability in a global way and and so and the layout mode with the nesting option really offers that uh so i try to really always talk about it within my training um and to um students go also naturally towards a zero waste pattern like i always have one or two students within the class that are interested by that so uh if i have opportunities on my side i'm always keen on sharing with my students but on top of that we've got um at ifm a department specifically uh made for it and we've built a lot of partnerships with the big industry leaders mostly within the luxury field um that are from france as you know we've got uh lvmh uh caring um and and uh different other uh big films that uh are supporting us and so i think that offers a great opportunities to student a great opportunity to students to just um uh find jobs like i see a lot of of my students uh finding a job right away after the school um and i think there's two things there's the soft skills uh so we want people that are super open smiley and and positive towards their work and we want also open minds uh that are super creative so these are i think the values uh that we teach in the school uh then we've got also business side of things with it within ifm because we've got we're teaching with uh business students of course they get the chance to build a strong uh uh commercial uh approach uh but within the creative master i have to say the emphasize is really on creativity and and openness yeah we want them to be able to jump from one medium to another uh seamlessly because i think this is the future just you can just like jump from cloud to then substance and then extract it to to print something and it needs to be uh seamless in a way so um so we try to really uh teach them that because we know that the companies are eager to work in in this way yeah and i think it goes also the other way around when you've got people that come to the to the market with uh um with a new skill you also offer sometimes the the environment that can satisfy them so that makes make them stay and also that will have a positive impact on your company so uh i try to go both ways actually the students come at a master level they come with a vision sometimes and they have you know some of them have been trying uh japanese uh flat on table pattern making and then they come to ifm and they already have a a good idea of what they will want to do so sometimes i'm more following the waters and and telling them yeah so you're trying to do this fold and and then i'm gonna try to teach that and then and then some other will have no idea what pattern making uh can look like in 3d and then we discover tools together and for instance the tools where you can like increase the shape by just pulling in one direction so they work pretty in both direction 2d and flat no i think but on my side i think it's it's uh almost this it's the same it's just that i think the stakes for the students are different sometimes they know that you know some of them will tell me you know the computer is not my friend uh and and they will start the training like that and uh and i think that's interesting because then they get the chance to do something uh they have almost no consideration for at the beginning because they will be like yeah i'm just going to create that stupid dress yeah and and then uh all of a sudden that turns out to be something that has a shape and and reacts like in real life and and then they click with the software so i think uh on my side i think it's exactly the same as as uh approaching garmin in real life i think the result can variate like the they can create something in real life and then have a completely different vision in in the software because they didn't think of of um touching the fabric in that way you know one thing i see a lot is playing with the scale and that's something they don't always have the chance to when you use a fabric you don't always want to waste that much fabric and you don't like increase dramatically the size of of the body or of the of the fabric and then you get interesting results just out of doing that and also there's things you don't dare to do in in real life that you would dare to do in 3d i remember that this inflated dress i don't think the final creation of this student was that but she just went crazy because she was like this is my space and and i like that about digital fashion also you can just make weird stuff and and look what it gives so we're quite lucky it's between 10 and 20 students i think yeah when when we're 10 it's super easy when we're training at 20 actually it's not that hard because then they get to help each other and there's a bit of a mood in the class like a good mood of course in the class that helps uh just uh drive the class meaning we would have like a few uh days of training repotted throughout the year but i gave the feedback and my students gave the feedback in a survey that we we tended to forget a couple of things we took and we prefer to switch to uh a workshop so now we're morphing into something that will be more condensed and and will allow people to uh just learn the software in one go and then they have an access to the computer rooms or can get the license uh on their computer   but yeah mostly as we are well equipped uh within the computer rooms it's it's great to just uh have them uh work on the computers we provide and then they can always like sometimes they send emails but i think the work the workshop idea works really well i would say yes you can start from scratch now with the new features of claw seven you can also do parametric design uh within um claw like you would do in another software you can grade so there's two options to grade you can either grade like you would do in a traditional uh 2d pattern making software or you can use the auto grading feature which follows the shape of the avatar you modify so this is a bit more experimental i show that feature to my students it's not but what as a consultant what i see mainly right now is that as companies have a background with other uh 2d softwares they tend to export as a dxf pattern their former lecturer or gerber patterns and and then we stitch them within close 3d so that they can use it ",

        "Transcript": "in this tutorial we will be reviewing the camera properties in the render mode these examples here show how to capture renders which have the visual effect similar to a single lens reflex camera or what you might think of as a photographer's camera I'm going to be using this project here to help us with most of this tutorial by default the closed camera is set up to focus on the entire scene what I've done here is I've hidden the object browser and now we're going to look at the default camera properties in Khloe as you can see the field of view is set to 15. what this means is is that if you were to look at this from above and look at this particular example the field of view would be about 15 degrees left to right if I change this to something say 55 degrees or what might be considered a wide angle lens as you can see it opens up the area that the camera is seeing but what you see is actually different the subject for lack of a better word is a bit distorted as you can see there is some extreme almost stretching happening in all directions I often change this to 25 or 30 depending upon what I have going on to give me a more realistic visual in terms of how the scene is set up the next thing we have is view orientation now honestly I would probably always just leave this on spherical because what will happen here is that these numbers will change based on how you move your mouse up and down left to right and zoom in and out the other option would be absolute but you would have to input the numbers for both the absolute horizontal and vertical shift the next option is what's called a clipping plane the default measurements here are 10 for near and 100 000 for far that means that the nearest thing that you were going to be able to capture is 10 millimeters from you the furthest is a hundred thousand millimeters so if you wanted to change these you could again the near clip plane would be the nearest distance that the camera can capture the far would be the furthest distance the camera can capture now if we go into the physical camera it says render only which means you will only be able to see the effects of it while you are in the render mode in the physical camera you have your exposure which includes ISO F number shutter speed and white balance as well as depth of field let's start with ISO the iso is the sensitivity of the sensor or film to light the higher the iso number the greater the sensitivity to light whereas a lower ISO number the sensor or film is less sensitive to light so if we look at this chart here and we see the iso 100 number this has a low sensitivity to light low noise higher quality here is an example of that if we go back to this chart now we will see that as these numbers get higher you have a higher sensitivity to light more noise and lower quality and here is an example of that the next thing is What's called the F number the F number is the aperture or the opening that lets in the light into the camera as the numbers increase the opening gets smaller and each increment halves the amount of light entering the camera the depth of field increases as the aperture closes so that objects that are differing distances from the camera can both be in focus when the aperture is at its narrowest the foreground and background are in both sharp Focus so in this chart here as you can see this F number here 1.4 you have a shallow depth of field it is brighter and just your subject is in focus if you go all the way up to f11 here you will notice that everything is in focus and it is a very deep depth of field but it is a darker picture because that opening in the aperture is smaller next we have shutter speed that actually means the amount of time that your shutter is open and capturing light the longer the shutter speed the slower it is typical exposure times can range from one second to one one thousandth of a second longer exposure times often result in blurry images since the aperture is open longer and any movement is captured throughout the exposure in Khloe for still images movement will not be an issue if we look here at this example you will see that a one second aperture speed is open longer the action is blurred and the picture is brighter at the on the other end of the scale 1 500th of a second it is a shorter exposure the action is frozen and the image itself is darker next is white balance this relates to the overall feel in terms of color for your image in our clue example here you will notice that the white balance by default is white itself if I were to change the white balance for example if I use my eyedropper and pick the orange that is on the stripe of the hood you will see that overall my image shifts a little bit because I am telling my camera that that orangish yellowish color is the basis for what should be known as white now I'm going to show you what happens when we make changes while we're in the render window I currently have interactive render running I have made my 3D window smaller so that we can see more of our interactive render and I've hidden my object browser so we can see just the property editor here's our field of view if I change this number to 50 from 15 to something that's a little larger say 25 as you can see what happens is that my field of view opens to get closer I will have to zoom in a little bit I'll scroll my wheel in a little bit so we can get a little bit closer nothing else is changing except what will be changing is my view orientation because of the distance here that is changing so that has been reset my field of view is open and I am zoomed in a little bit closer if I come here now and I turn up my physical camera on you will see that here are all of my options here a good option here is the focus by left click and if I hover my cursor you can see that I get a focus icon which means that I can focus on any one of these three different avatars so I'm going to start by clicking on the closest Avatar what this will redo I am then going to refresh the interactive render and now we can begin to see the difference when we focused with our left click the Avatar that is in the front is going to be completely focused and then the the avatar on the left and in the center are going to be in different levels of focus if I were to now click on the middle Avatar this would refresh my entire render and the Avatar in the back would then become the focus as you can see now the Avatar in the front is out of focus the Avatar to the left is a little less out of focus and in full focus is the center Avatar the final option here in our physical camera properties is underneath depth of field effects I'm going to check this button and we will have two options we will have vertical tilt and horizontal tilt the values here are from a minimum of -1 to a maximum of one this works by adding the value and pressing return so the horizontal tilt makes it appear as though your image is flattened out or kind of laying on a table if I do the same thing with a negative number in the vertical tilt it's going to flatten it out as well and make it look as though it's on a wall and you're standing close to the wall looking at it finally here is an example using the same project and giving it different settings if we remember the default camera properties were ISO 400 F number eight shutter speed 30. what I've what I'm showing you here is that I have an example a on the left in example B on the example a I have focused on the hand of the avatar I've changed the iso to 100 and I have left the F number at default and I've changed the shutter speed in the example on the right I have changed the iso to 1600. I've changed the F number to two and the shutter speed to 250. and I've also changed the focus from the hand to the Avatar's face so you can see what happens when you change all of these things as it relates to how the light works the lights themselves are the same in both images I did not change the light at all it is going to take some experimentation on your part to get used to changing the camera properties along with changing the camera properties the lighting is going to come into play as well whether you use individual lights the Khloe hdri lights or third-party hdri lights what you can do should you find a camera setup that you really like is that you can simply at the top of the property editor click the save button and Khloe will save all of your settings here for the camera properties so that you could open these up in another project ",
        "Summary": "Certainly! Below is a comprehensive guide based on the provided tutorial transcript about camera properties in render mode, particularly focusing on creating visual effects similar to those produced by a single lens reflex (SLR) camera. --- ### Comprehensive Guide to Camera Properties in Render Mode #### Introduction This guide will help you understand and utilize camera properties in a 3D rendering environment (referred to as \"Khloe\" in the tutorial). The focus will be on achieving realistic effects akin to those produced by a photographer's camera through various adjustments. ### Step-by-Step Instructions #### 1. **Accessing Camera Properties** - Start by opening your project in Khloe. - Hide the object browser to focus on the camera properties. - Navigate to the camera settings, typically found in the property editor. #### 2. **Adjusting Field of View (FoV)** - **Definition**: The field of view determines the extent of the observable world that can be seen at any given moment. - **Default Setting**: The default FoV is set to 15 degrees. - **Adjustment**: - To change, locate the FoV setting in the properties. - Increase the value to 25 or 30 degrees for a more realistic view (if desired). - For a wide-angle effect, set it to around 55 degrees, but note that distortion may occur. #### 3. **Choosing View Orientation** - **Options**: - **Spherical** (recommended): Adjusts automatically as you move your mouse. - **Absolute**: Requires manual input of horizontal and vertical shift values. - **Recommendation**: Leave on spherical for ease of use. #### 4. **Setting Clipping Planes** - **Definition**: Clipping planes define the range of distances from the camera that will be rendered. - **Defaults**: Near clip plane = 10mm, Far clip plane = 100,000mm. - **Adjustment**: - Change these values to capture objects closer than 10mm or further than 100,000mm if necessary. #### 5. **Understanding Physical Camera Settings** - Activate the physical camera settings by enabling \"Render Only.\" ##### a. **ISO** - **Definition**: Sensitivity of the sensor/film to light. - **Adjustment**: - Lower ISO (e.g., 100) = less sensitivity, higher quality, less noise. - Higher ISO (e.g., 1600) = more sensitivity, more noise, lower quality. ##### b. **F Number (Aperture)** - **Definition**: The size of the opening through which light enters. - **Adjustment**: - Lower F number (e.g., 1.4) = wider aperture, shallow depth of field, brighter image with focus on the subject. - Higher F number (e.g., 11) = narrower aperture, deeper depth of field, darker image with more elements in focus. ##### c. **Shutter Speed** - **Definition**: Duration the shutter is open to capture light. - **Adjustment**: - Longer shutter speed (e.g., 1 second) = brighter image, potential motion blur. - Shorter shutter speed (e.g., 1/500 second) = darker image, frozen motion. ##### d. **White Balance** - Adjusts the color temperature of the image. - Use the eyedropper tool to set a reference color in the scene, ensuring accurate color representation. #### 6. **Focus and Depth of Field** - **Adjustment**: - Left-click on an object in the scene to set focus. This will render that object in sharp focus while others appear blurred based on the depth of field settings. - Experiment with focusing on different elements to see how it affects the overall image. #### 7. **Depth of Field Effects** - Enable depth of field effects in the physical camera settings. - **Adjustments**: - **Vertical Tilt**: Ranges from -1 to 1, affecting the depth perception. - **Horizontal Tilt**: Similar adjustments, altering the perspective. #### 8. **Experimentation** - Test various combinations of ISO, F number, and shutter speed to see their effects on the rendered image. - Use consistent lighting conditions to observe how changes in camera settings impact the final output. #### 9. **Saving Camera Settings** - Once you find a desirable camera setup, save your settings: - Click the “Save” button in the property editor to store camera settings for future projects. ### Tips and Tricks - **Start Simple**: Begin with small adjustments to understand how each setting influences the render. - **Use Reference Images**: Compare your renders with real-world photography to better understand depth of field, focus, and exposure. - **Practice**: Regular experimentation with different lighting and camera settings will improve your skills over time. - **Documentation**: Keep notes on successful settings for future reference. ### Conclusion By following this guide, you can effectively manipulate camera properties in Khloe to create realistic and visually appealing renders. Remember, the key to mastering camera settings lies in practice and experimentation! Happy rendering!"
