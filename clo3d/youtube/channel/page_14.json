        "publishedAt": "2021-11-29T16:14:45Z",
        "Transcript": "the term uv refers to the bi-dimensional 2d nature of the process the letters u and v denote the axes of the 2d texture because x y and z are already used to denote the axes of the 3d model here's an example that we like to use at khloe we've all at least seen what something like this a chocolate candy wrapped in aluminum to look like a three-dimensional object on the left is the candy completely unwrapped on the right fully wrapped and in the middle we have taken the wrapper off and flattened it out in effect this is what we're going to do in this lesson is take our denim and flatten it out so that we can wrap it around our pattern pieces and create the illusion of a realistic denim pair of jeans for this lesson you're going to need three things a finished garment in this case men's jeans an image or scans of a full garment from real life and finally an image editing program preferably adobe photoshop the first thing we're going to do is we're going to work in khloe with our existing garment as you can see this is a pair of men's denim jeans and i have the khloe denim raw fabric applied to the fat to the pattern pieces i have also applied buttons grommets and top stitches as well i have laid these patterns out in my 2d window like this for a specific purpose they should be laid out like this in your 2d window because you will need a nice layout in your uv editor when you get there the first thing i'm going to do is i am going to click on the denim raw fabric here and delete the texture from the basic parameters this leaves me with just white pattern pieces i also have a zipper fabric that i have put in there we can just simply ignore this for the moment once we have removed the textures from the pattern pieces that we're going to be using we can switch to our uv editor we do this by coming up to the upper right of the clo window clicking on simulation and choosing the uv editor the reason that we put our patterns in the arrangement that we did in the 2d window is so that it would be easy to then arrange them in this window here this area is the zero to one uv if i right click in the background i can start by saying reset uv to 2d arrangement the next thing i can do is select these pieces these are the textures for the grommets the top stitches and the buttons we're not going to need these but we're going to put these here so that they're out of the way then i'm going to right click in the background and say fit all uv to 0 1. this then puts our uv into this area which is what we would like to do i'm going to simply leave this length absolute as my default setting next we are going to bake the textures and export them so that we can use them externally i'm going to click on this icon here that says bake textures the first thing we're going to do is we're going to choose a place to save them i'm going to save them in this folder here with all my files for this tutorial and i'm going to say men's denim uv and click save leave the size at the standard 2k leave the uv era area to at zero to one and make sure that you check diffuse and normal diffuse is the white part here of our pattern pieces and click save once the progress bar goes through you can click close and you can exit out of the uv editor back to simulation now we need to do some work in photoshop i was able to take a decent photo of a pair of jeans that i own and i removed any hint of copyright or markings that relate to the company who created the genes you can also use scans scan your genes in pieces most importantly it's having the entire garment or as much of it as possible to create this entire uv texture next open up the diffuse layer of your genes that you have exported from khloe this is just the pattern pieces as you can see it still has my zipper texture in there i can delete these as they are not at part of my layout for the uv which i want to cover the textures for the rest of the garment i can also delete the textures for the snaps the buttons the grommets and the top stitches the next thing you're going to do is either drag your denim images or scans into photoshop or copy paste them from other documents i like to take these two and put them into a group from layers so that i can easily turn them on and off or change the opacity of the scans all at once mine i dragged in here so these are smart objects so i will need to rasterize these smart objects before i move forward next what you want to do is you want to scale these so that the sizing of each of the images starts to match the pattern pieces that are here for example this is our wearer's right leg this is our wearer's left leg my pattern pieces are transparent so i can see through and see these see the pattern pieces underneath if you would like you can put a temporary layer underneath with a darker color so that if you want to be able to better see your pattern pieces you will be able to do so so we would select these and be sure to either shift select both of these or or lock these together link them so that when you scale them they scale together so that the width and the height of everything starts to match up as needed next i cut out the pockets and the belt loops and i even used some blank texture for help underneath the waistband in the front and the back a very important tool that i use is what's called the puppet warp tool and if you're not familiar with this i will give you a quick lesson on how to use this if i select this layer here which is this particular part of the leg under the edit menu there is an option here that says puppet warp what this does is when you select this it turns your selected selected pixel imagery into a mesh and you can then add in the add in pins that will help you to to do two things one to keep the pieces in place where you want them to stay in place and two you can click and drag these pieces so that the pieces move you can get very minut changes or you can also get very large changes and scalings so that you can make sure that your pattern pieces covered are covered by the texture that is the main thing that you're trying to do here is to have your pattern pieces be covered by the denim textures here in photoshop this one i could use the puppet warp to fix this here edit puppet warp and what i would need to do is i would need to anchor this so that parts of this won't move and then i could pull this out if i were to for example come up here and click this and move this it's going to move the whole thing so if you are moving just a s small portion of this make sure that you add in pins to hold it in place so that you can move the one okay along with your clone stamp and healing brush and basic scale and rotate you should be able to get all of these pieces together and when you file export save for web you can choose jpeg maximum or png to export and you will then be left with a single piece which will be used as the uv texture for your realistic denim jeans i'm going to look at my denim raw fabric here i'm going to come to the front here and i'm going to delete the normal map from here because when we baked our textures in the uv editor we also exported the uv normal map i'm going to change this texture mapping to unified and then i'm going to click on the texture here and here is my uv map that i was just working on in photoshop and i'm going to open that and this will come in here this falls perfectly in here because i have said unified i'm also going to click here to put the normal map in from that export as well which is this one here for the side i am simply going to click here on this side option i currently have a normal map in there which will give me some texture i'm going to click the color option here and i'm going to use my eyedropper to pick a color to go in there so there is our finished denim uv map and our realistic looking men's jeans thank you for watching if you enjoyed

        "Summary": "## Comprehensive Guide to Creating Realistic Denim Jeans Textures Using CLO 3D and Photoshop ### Overview This guide outlines the process of creating a realistic denim texture for a 3D garment, specifically a pair of men's jeans. It includes step-by-step instructions, definitions, tips, and tricks to ensure a seamless workflow between CLO 3D and Photoshop. ### Definitions - **UV Mapping**: The process of projecting a 2D image onto a 3D model's surface. - **Diffuse Map**: The base color texture of the material. - **Normal Map**: A texture that adds detail to the surface by simulating bumps and wrinkles. - **Puppet Warp Tool**: A Photoshop feature that allows you to manipulate and warp parts of an image while keeping other parts in place. ### Requirements 1. **CLO 3D Software**: For garment design and UV mapping. 2. **Photoshop**: For editing textures and images. 3. **Finished Garment**: In this case, men's jeans. 4. **Images/Scans of Denim**: High-quality images or scans of denim fabric. 5. **Computer**: To run CLO 3D and Photoshop. ### Step-by-Step Instructions #### Part 1: Preparing in CLO 3D 1. **Open CLO 3D**: - Launch CLO 3D and load your finished garment (men’s jeans). 2. **Remove Existing Textures**: - Click on the denim fabric in the properties panel. - Delete the existing texture from the basic parameters to leave only white pattern pieces. 3. **Set Up Pattern Pieces**: - Arrange your pattern pieces in the 2D window for clarity, as this will help when working in the UV editor. 4. **Access the UV Editor**: - Go to the upper right of the CLO window, click on \"Simulation,\" and select \"UV Editor.\" 5. **Reset UV to 2D Arrangement**: - Right-click in the background of the UV editor and select \"Reset UV to 2D Arrangement.\" 6. **Fit UVs to Zero to One**: - Select all pieces (grommets, buttons, etc.) and right-click to choose \"Fit All UV to 0 1\". 7. **Bake Textures**: - Click the icon for baking textures. - Select a save location and name the file (e.g., “men’s denim uv”). - Ensure the settings are set to 2K for size, zero to one for the UV area, and check 'Diffuse' and 'Normal'. - Click \"Save\" and wait for the progress bar to complete. 8. **Exit the UV Editor**: - Once baking is complete, close the UV editor and return to the main simulation window. #### Part 2: Editing Textures in Photoshop 1. **Open Photoshop**: - Start Photoshop and open the diffuse layer of your exported jeans texture. 2. **Remove Unwanted Textures**: - Delete any textures that are not part of your denim layout (like zippers and buttons). 3. **Import Denim Images/Scans**: - Drag your denim images or scans into Photoshop. Ensure they are high quality. 4. **Organize Layers**: - Group your denim layers for easy management. You can change opacity or visibility easily this way. 5. **Rasterize Smart Objects** (if applicable): - If your denim images are smart objects, right-click on them and choose \"Rasterize Layer\". 6. **Scale Denim Images**: - Resize the denim images to match the pattern pieces. Use the transparency of your pattern pieces as a guide. 7. **Cut Out Pockets and Belt Loops**: - Use selection tools to cut out these elements from your denim textures. 8. **Use the Puppet Warp Tool**: - Select the desired layer and go to Edit > Puppet Warp. - Add pins to anchor certain areas and drag others to fit the pattern pieces better. 9. **Refine Texture with Tools**: - Use tools like the Clone Stamp and Healing Brush to ensure the texture fits well. 10. **Export the Final Texture**: - Go to File > Export > Save for Web. - Choose JPEG maximum or PNG format and save your final texture. #### Part 3: Applying the Texture in CLO 3D 1. **Return to CLO 3D**: - Go back to your CLO 3D project. 2. **Delete Old Normal Map**: - Remove the existing normal map from the denim fabric properties. 3. **Change Texture Mapping**: - Set the mapping to ‘Unified’. 4. **Import New UV Map**: - Click on the texture and load your newly created UV map from Photoshop. 5. **Add Normal Map**: - Import the normal map you exported from the UV editor. 6. **Final Adjustments**: - For the side view, adjust the normal map and choose an appropriate base color using the eyedropper tool. ### Tips and Tricks - **Ensure High-Quality Images**: Use high-resolution images or scans for the best results. - **Layer Organization**: Keep your layers organized in Photoshop to easily manage and edit different components. - **Practice with Puppet Warp**: Familiarize yourself with the Puppet Warp tool for better manipulation of textures. - **Save Regularly**: Save your work frequently to avoid losing progress. - **Experiment with Textures**: Don’t hesitate to try different denim textures to find the perfect look for your jeans. ### Conclusion By following this guide, you’ll be able to create a realistic denim texture for your 3D jeans using CLO 3D and Photoshop. This process not only enhances the visual appeal of your designs but also helps in understanding the importance of UV mapping and texture application in 3D modeling.

        "Transcript": "here is our dress where we left off in part one let's go on to part two so i am actually going to go to the clove fabric library click on fabric and simply pick a nice cotton i will choose the cotton 40s poplin i'm going to drag this right onto my fabric in my object browser and i'm going to desaturate the texture that is on this fabric and i'm going to change the color to this to something that is just neutral okay we're going to be changing this color based on what we're going to do with our pattern our texture at the end then i'm going to make a copy of this i'm going to simply click the copy option here and what i want to do is i actually want to go back and make this version of the pattern i'm going to make the original version of the pattern white but prior to that i want to apply this new fabric right now to just the waistband now if i go back to my original copy of this and change my fabric back to white i will have a separate color this dress i'm going to use a separate color to help us with some details the first detail i'm going to create is that i'm going to click on this outer segment line of the dress hem right click and say offset pattern outline when i do this here we can see the the distance the default i'm going to change this to 3 inches and i am going to say to create an internal line when i do this as you can see our pattern extends and there is now an internal line on our pattern the reason that i did this is so that i could actually select this internal line right click and say cut and so so this will become trim in the contrast color the other thing i'd like to do with this is i would like to add a lettuce edge to our trim that is that right here on the end of our skirt i can do this by also using our elastic effect i'm going to use my edit pattern tool select the trim turn on the elastic in the property editor and here instead of letting it get smaller or leaving at 100 i'm going to put in the number 125. when i do that and simulate our lettuce edge will be formed by the longer line on the edge of this trim and when we go to a high resolution garment this will be more pronounced next thing i would like to do is i would like to add a trim around her neck in a similar way that we did here rather than offset our pattern i'm going to select this segment line right click and say offset as internal line here is the last measurement that i put in here which was at one and a half i'm going to then say two inches and click okay again i will be left with an internal line which i can then select and cut and sew and because my pattern was unfolded with symmetric editing it also did the same for the other side and i will apply my new fabric to this next i'd like to put this same trim on the back but because the neckline in the back is a little more shallow it's a little difficult to offset the internal line when i do that it doesn't quite match up with the line that's in the front so i'm going to keep this line in here and i'm going to manually edit the end point so that it matches up with the front part of the pattern it's a little tricky to get them to visually match i could measure the line and insert a segment point if i want i'm just going to do this manually until i get it really close there we go then as you can see my line is a little bit the curve is a little bit off so i'm going to take my edit curve point tool and remove the curve points that are there i can then add in the curve points and change my curve to match the front so that it looks like a continuous curve i will then just simply select again and cut and sew and then i will select those two pattern pieces and assign the contrast color i think i'd like to add some sleeves i'm going to use a new tool called the spiral tool this creates a spiral pattern piece to start i'm going to shift select both sides of the opening for my sleeve when i do that on my cursor i get a measurement that measurement is around 15 and a half inches and i'm going to keep that and remember that for when i create the spiral pattern so here's my spiral tool i'm going to simply click in my 2d window and i will get a dialog box that is going to allow me to edit my pattern there is an inner radius that i can change that will change the opening the overall size there is an offset that if i set to zero will create a perfect circle now when i do that and if i then change the inner circle to be the measurement that i want to go in my sleeve opening i'm going to make it a little larger than the actual measurement i think i'll make it 20. i get a really nice circular pattern i could also change the inner and outer end pieces if i wanted to make this asymmetrical i'm going to leave them the same measurement two and a half inches and then click okay to finish again i'm going to make this pattern the contrast fabric and i'm going to rotate this so that i can then place it where it would go around the shoulder i'm then going to make a symmetrical copy with sewing and make sure that one also lines up in the right place i'm going to use one to multiple free sewing front of the sleeve the back of the sleeve and because these are symmetrical patterns it does the other side for me as well when we simulate the sleeves fall right into place and as you can see because of the sizing i start to get a nice ruffle going around the shoulders you can also see that the ruching has improved because of the shearing that is going on there and that will get even better when we turn this into a high resolution garment finally i am actually going to change the lengths of these inside pieces because now that this is a circular pattern there are curve points on the outer and inner edges of my pattern so when i change these lengths if i shorten them from two and a half to one i get a nice asymmetrical shape going on if i change them both the same length in the same direction then when i put them into place and let them simulate there will be a nice wider part on the top of my shoulder the inner sewing length stays the same and the sewing does not get affected at all finally i'm going to again use my elastic technique to add a lettuce edge to the outside of these two sleeves so that they will match the lettuce that has edge that has been applied to the bottom of my trim of my skirt there is one final construction part of the dress that i want to take care of and that is i want to add a zipper to the center back of the bodice the first thing i do is delete the existing sewing that is there and simulate so the two halves fall open when they then fall open i can then go ahead and place in my zipper i select the zipper tool and i start at the top and move down the segment where i want the first part of the zipper to go in and i double click that line turns dark to let me know that i have successfully placed the first half and then i do the other half starting at the top coming down to the bottom and double clicking on the blue picking point i can then see that my zipper has successfully been put into my garment i'll simulate so the two halves come together and what i like to do is immediately select the zipper in this case and change the width especially in a woman's garment to make it a little bit more delicate and then i also select the hardware the slider and change it as well as the puller and change it to be something a little bit more delicate and there our entire garment has been finished our last piece being the zipper so now let's change the print and the color of our fabrics i have some patterns here that i would like to choose from and i specifically have an illustrator file that i'm going to use it has three color ways in it i'm simply going to take this file and in from the library i'm going to left click and drag it right on top of the icon in the object browser i then have my three colorways and i'm going to choose the one in the middle here the blue one and click ok so there is my pattern it's a little small for my taste so i'm going to use my texture edit tool next i think i would like to change the solid color of the contrasting fabric i'm going to simply click on the color in the property after selecting it in the object browser and click on the eyedropper in the color palette window then i'm going to select the color that i want in this case the blue press escape to get out of the eye dropper i can also affect the materials of all the other parts of glow in this case the zipper i'm going to start by selecting the zipper tape and i'm going to change the actual zipper tape using the assets in clo from in this case plastic to nylon and then i'm again going to click on the color icon and use my eye dropper to change the zipper to blue select the hardware of the zipper i can change the material to something else in this case plastic and also change it to self color blue to match the dress and the tape of the zipper to complete her outfit i'm actually going to change the color of the shoes i could change everything about these shoes if i want but i am just going to select the uppers shift select both of them and when i do that i will notice that in the property editor there is a texture there i'm going to delete that texture using the little trash can to the right i'm going to change the material from matte to silk or satin and then one last time i'm going to use my eye dropper to change her shoes to blue at this point i'm going to stop on this dress we could of course do some editing with darts or lengths and as we move on to see a turntable we've done some styling of our avatar and made a couple other small edits on the fabric itself and the smocking around the waist

        "Transcript": "hi guys thank you for joining our clo min workshop today we will talk about how to make their name washing effect on our virtual denim garment we've divided our workshop into two parts for the first part we will use denim jacket as an example to demonstrate how we create denim fabric and also the dynum details we will also cover the cutaway part to manage the color combination for our design and for the second part we will use denim skirt as an example to talk about some advanced random details and how we manage the render setting to output the final product image so let's start now here is the base form of my denim jacket so my next step is to create random fabric and assign it as we know that denim fabric have two different texture on front and back side so before we create our own denim fabric we have to prepare two different texture images first in our material menu we can change different texture for each side of our fabric we can assign texture image for front side of dynam fabric first simply drag and drop the texture image to the texture bar and adjust the normal map by moving the intensity bar to express the uneven texture of our fabric don't forget to change the physical property of our fabric in daniel after finish the setting for our front side island fabric now we can move to back menu to assign different texture for back side dynam fabric turn off the setting use same material as front and then we can change our back side texture now don't forget to delete the previous normal map and update again now i will duplicate the denim fabric and make it as a double-sided texture turn on the setting use same material as font to synchronize the front side and back side texture assign the double side fabric for some design details like waffles trim pockets and even cups   next let's talk about how to add denim texture on the buttons double click the button in object browser menu you will see the texture and normal map bar in property editor we can just simply drag and drop the denom texture into the texture bar and also adjust the normal map by moving the intensity bar if the texture image scale not same with the garment texture image you can also change the texture image size in transformation menu to achieve more with mystic results we can also adjust the seam property for our denim garment we can use at this sewing tool to change the seam line intensity take an example of these two sim lines the left hand side one we keep the intensity as default 10 the right hand side one we change it as 80. so this is the way that how we emphasize the seam line texture by changing the seam line intensity   now i will select all the seam line by holding ctrl and a on my keyboard and change all the seam line intensity to 80.   next let's talk about top stitch in close we can use different top stitch tool to edit or add top stitch on our garment in this project i have already added some single top stitch on my denim jacket here a tip want to share with you guys sometimes when we create top stitch on gators flee or grease this surface the top stitch may not be follow the fabric surface smoothly in this case we can change our top stitch type into texture to fix this issue   with our top stitch style we can also change the thread thickness and color based on our design change the configuration if needed once we change the face as both our top stitch will be shown in both sides of our fabric   now i will demonstrate how to add top stitch and also change the top stitch style by using our free top stitch tool i can add the new top stitch on the placket i can also assign a new top stitch style by added top stitch tool double click the new top stitch style and change the stitch count in two to make it as a double top stitch and of course we can keep to use the same material but only change the top stitch distance only we can move to the puckling part we can add puckering for streamline and internal line by different puckering tools in this project i have already added puckling on double sim line parts so double click the pocketing settings you can change the purpling material type in denim if you want to make more realistic denim look like washing effect on the seam line you can also add the texture image for the puckling texture and change the color in daniel glue   we can also customize the puckling width try to add more puckling texture on different parts of the garment it will help to create different washing event look we can also change the buckling fit direction by using active puckling tool more purple texture we add more variation of washing effect we can play with we can also try to add more graphics on the denim fabric to make our design more interesting and more fashionable we can use the texture editor tool so once we open the texture editor we can simply drag and drop the graphics image into the texture editor menu and adjust the setting of the graphics for example to repeat pattern the saturation and even the blend mode we can also check and fine-tune the repeat unit in the texture editor b to create more color combination for our styles we can even go to our colorway work mode and change the texture or color or graphics directly in the colorway editor just select the colorway you want to edit and go back to texture editor to change the new fabric texture but still keep the repeat graphics don't forget to update the normal map when we change the texture image we can also try with the saturation function to make our jacket in girly pastel color and change the graphics if you want the new design in calorie work mode we can also change the multi-top stitch color at the same time so let's play with different texture and make more designs as you want this is the end of our part 1 mini workshop don't forget to like our video and also subscribe our club channel hope you guys enjoy and good bye you ",

        "Transcript": "hello and welcome to another glow tutorial in this video i will show you how you can easily create realistic looking lace with the help of graphics and maps i want to create a see-through laser pleak on the upper part of the silky strap top so far it is completely opaque and consists of only one pattern piece in the front as the oblique that i am going to use is not completely symmetrical first i will remove the symmetrized editing property from the piece when you choose what type of lace to scan for your project it is best to choose a version of it that is light and pastel colored but not stark white and definitely not pitch black you can apply a different color to it later in the property editor or of course even before in your image editing software the reason why a light colored lace works best is because these types of colors will retain most detail in their height and depth during the scanning process and when being colored in differently afterwards the lace i have chosen is off white i am adding my scanned lace as a graphic then i am repositioning it to fit the idea i have for this garment it will look slightly cut off for now but we're going back to fixing that later before we add maps to our lace transparency i will use the internal polygon tool to mark where i'd like to cut apart the front piece depending on the colors you have chosen it might be easier to see this way before adding transparency i'm holding down control on the keyboard in order to place curve points as i am clicking in this specific example i am not penciling in the outline of the lace but an edge further within as the type of processing that would be used in this case would require a thin stripe of fabric on the lower part to be attached to the overlaying lace before i cut the pattern piece apart in two i will place a few maps on the graphic when i cut the pattern piece the graphic will remain on both the lower and upper new pieces alternatively i could also delete the graphic on the lower piece and apply the option over seam line to the graphic when i created the internal line the pattern p3 mesh therefore i am quickly simulating in order to have the top drape correctly again a map is the overall surface of a component in the 3d space technically the graphic itself is also a map a color map in chloe called the color map texture i've also added a displacement map in order to create a geometric surface field the output of this will only be visible in the render preview and final render output so here in our quality render view within the 3d window the site remains flat for now you could also add normal map to fake height in depth but in this specific case here it doesn't add much to the final output due to the potency of the displacement map next the upper pattern piece should be transparent itself so i'm creating a new fabric for it and setting its opacity to zero don't be irritated by display discrepancies in the 3d window this one is remedied once i turn off the quality render option what matters is the look in the render window as this is our high quality output i'm extending my pattern piece in order for it to show the entire lace inside the render window i can now witness a true-to-life expression of the scanned lace when i zoom in you can see that even in detail it looks tangible and touchable please don't forget to like and subscribe bye ",

This guide will cover all necessary steps, definitions, and tips for an efficient workflow. ### Step-by-Step Instructions 1. **Setting Up Your Project** - Open Glow and create a new project. - Import the garment pattern piece which is currently opaque and consists of just one pattern piece at the front. 2. **Removing Symmetrical Editing Property** - Click on the pattern piece. - Access the properties panel and deselect the \"symmetrized editing\" option. This allows for more flexibility in editing the piece. 3. **Choosing the Right Lace** - Select a light, pastel-colored lace for scanning. Avoid stark white and pitch-black colors. - **Reasoning**: Light colors retain more detail during the scanning process and allow for better coloring later. 4. **Scanning the Lace** - Use a scanner or a high-resolution camera to capture the lace. - Save the scanned lace as an image file (preferably PNG or JPEG). 5. **Adding the Lace Graphic** - Import the scanned lace graphic into your project. - Position the lace graphic to fit the design of your garment. It may appear slightly cut off initially, but adjustments will be made later. 6. **Marking Cut Areas** - Use the **Internal Polygon Tool** to mark where you would like to cut the front piece. - Hold down the **Control key** while placing curve points to make precise adjustments. 7. **Cutting the Pattern Piece** - After marking the cut areas, divide the pattern piece into two parts based on your design. - Ensure that the graphic of the lace remains assigned to both the upper and lower pieces. 8. **Applying Maps to the Graphic** - Apply different maps to the lace graphic for enhanced realism: - **Color Map**: The basic texture that gives color to your lace. - **Displacement Map**: This adds geometric details to the surface, enhancing the depth and texture (only visible in render previews). - Optionally, you can use a **Normal Map** for additional height and depth, though it may not significantly contribute if a displacement map is used. 9. **Creating Transparency for the Upper Piece** - For the upper pattern piece, create a new fabric by: - Setting its opacity to **0** to make it transparent. - Note: Monitor any display discrepancies in the 3D window, as these will be resolved once you switch to render mode. 10. **Adjusting Pattern Piece Size** - Extend the upper pattern piece to ensure that the entire lace is visible in the render window. 11. **Previewing the Render** - Switch to the **Quality Render View** within the 3D window. - Zoom in to check the details of the lace. You should see a realistic and tactile appearance. ### Definitions - **Lace Graphic**: A visual representation of the lace pattern used in the garment design. - **Map**: In 3D modeling, a map refers to a surface texture applied to a model. - **Color Map**: Provides the base color for the texture. - **Displacement Map**: A grayscale image that affects the height of the surface, creating a 3D effect. - **Normal Map**: Similar to a displacement map but simulates depth without changing the actual model shape. ### Tips and Tricks - **Choosing Lace Colors**: Always opt for lighter colors when scanning lace to ensure that the details are preserved and can be manipulated later. - **Using the Control Key**: Holding the Control key while placing points allows for more accurate and curved lines when marking cut areas. - **Check Render Quality**: Regularly preview your work in the render mode to see how textures and colors are applied. - **Experiment with Maps**: Don’t hesitate to try different maps to find the best combination that enhances the lace's realism. - **Save Your Work Frequently**: Ensure that you save your progress to avoid losing any changes. ### Conclusion By following these steps, you will be able to create a beautifully realistic lace overlay for your garment design using Glow. Remember to experiment with different settings and maps to achieve the best results. Don’t forget to like and subscribe for more tutorials!"

        "Transcript": "hello everyone in this tutorial video i will show you how to construct a sports bra from already made patterns what will be important about this is i will also show you how to create from scratch some breast pads to then layer inside the sports bra so here i already have my avatar i will then load my spots patterns which have been saved as dxf file format if you would like to use the same files you will be able to download it through the link below the video so i will add it to the workspace by doing a right click on the file and then select the proper options so i will load type as add scale i will keep at auto scale and in terms of the options right here i will not need the annotation and i'm just going to make sure to swap cutting line and sewing lines if i have some seam allowance in the case of this file seam allowance has not been added so in any case it will not really matter whether those options are ticked same for this one last one the convert to seam allowance i will keep it but it will not be necessary for this file i will press ok and here the patterns will appear so if we are looking into how to read those patterns so we will have multiple layers that will go below the first shell layer so here we have our shell layer here we have the second layer and here we have the third so the padding will become will come between the third and the second layer as you see on the third layer you have a little opening that is quite frequently there when you are looking into construction details of sports bra so first thing first is um to start to place some of the patterns around the avatar with the arrangement points so i will not place everything at once i'm going to work from one layer to the next so i will get started with the first layer so the two others i will select them and i will freeze them so once they're selected with your transform pattern tool you can then click right on one of the layer and select the option freeze we can then place all of those layers on the side so that they don't disturb us when we're going to use the arrangement points then zoom in onto the avatar in the 3d window and do shift f to bring the arrangement points or if you do not want to use the shortcut you can also find it here and then we can start to place our patterns so i will place my front right here then i will place here my sides and select one and place it on the side right here i can then if i want to move it on the arrangement point that go down when the pattern is still selected and change the position y and x so i can change the position x and a little bit of the position y so that it's aligned with the front pattern and i can do the same on the other side so i will change the position x and then change the position y i can then place those small parts on top of the shoulder like this move them again if necessary or change the rotation and then place the back so i will select the back piece and place it on the arrangement point that is in the middle of the back of the avatar then finally the waistband i will select it and place it on the front the arrangement point that is located on the front of the avatar and i will move this one up a little bit more once i have my first base arranged i can now hide my arrangement points and then start the sewing so i will use my sewing tools in the 2d window and get started with it so i will start with the segment sewing and stitch the sides like this and here too i will then stitch here and here and finally on the side if you feel it to be easy easier to do it in 3d you can also stitch in the 3d window and then i am just missing my waistband and here we are then i can also close the waistband so that it doesn't fall when i simulate and if necessary go back into your selection tool and bring the the pattern a little bit closer to the body so that here the sewing lines are not crossing the body so that afterwards when we simulate it is stable so once that is done then we can do our first simulation by pressing on this arrow or on our spacebar and here we go we have the first space of our bra i can readjust it with my mouse to make sure that it's properly aligned with the body or that at least it drapes or sits well so once i've placed this first layer i can then get started on the second layer so i will get started i will do all of the layers at once one after the other and then then we'll start to consider the breast pad so for the second layer i will not use the arrangement point as this will be easier to use a superimposed function so i'm going to basically start to stitch everything and then superimpose under so i will get started with my free sewing so i will take the free sewing tool and then get started by stitching the um edges together so here i'm going to start with this one which will use the technique 1 to m to stitch this one long segment with those multiple ones so i will go ahead and do it here press shift and then stitch everything around and then release the shift key because this pattern piece is going to play be placed underneath of the shell i'm going to make sure to change the sewing line type here to turn and this will be done for most of the sewing actually because there will always be layers underneath so i'm going to stitch now the side here and there again change the sewing line type here to turn and then the bottom piece here with my shift key again and then stitch everything together and release the shift key and here and here and change the sunlight type to turn and let me check did i turn these ones i haven't turned these ones so i can always go back by selecting my edit sewing tool to double check by selecting the sewing line and if i see that i haven't changed the sewing line type i can then just turn ahead then switch again to the free sewing tool and check if we are missing any sewing lines so for the ones that are on the side here we will omit them for now and just after we have also superimposed those pieces stitch those together so here and here as well as here and here so then once the stitchings uh are done i can then select my selection tool in the 3d window unfreeze so click right on the pattern unfreeze and then superimpose click right again superimpose underneath now the pattern should be placed you can simulate to make sure that everything is stable i can then superimpose the rest of the patterns so i'm gonna go again select my free sewing tool or in some cases i guess we can also just use the segment sewing tool so i will go with the segment sewing tool and layer the rest here and then i turn and then here and i turn and again here also when i turn and here and i turn and i can also do at the back already and i'll turn and here too and the top right so once this is done then we can superimpose those three pieces i will select my selection tool select all of those here then click right on one of them and click right again and select the option superimpose under and then simulate to make sure that everything is stable then once that is done we can then finalize by stitching the sides here and there so that it's closed so i can select again my segment sewing tool and do those last stitchings and because those are placed on the sides i do not need to turn my sewing line type it's only when the pattern is placed underneath through the sewing line here and then like this and the size right here so once that is done i can simulate to make sure everything is stable and if i see that it's stable then i can stop my simulation then i can go ahead and layer the last uh pieces this one right here so i can also get a head and get started with the sewing line so i will select my free sewing tool and stitch around here and then here so i prefer to stitch onto the middle layer just because it's it's going to be more stable than if you were to stitch on the first layer because otherwise if you sand with your sewing line it tends to move so here i will just then change the sewing line type again because i'm placing this layer underneath the second one and i will do the same with all of the other sewing here and then here and then the bottom one and i can do already the sides as well i can switch to my segment sewing tool and then turn and do the same for the other side and the back two and then finally the top here of the back oh and i changed made it cross so i do control b to uncross my sewing lines if they've been crossed and i think i have most of them the most important ones i can also because as you see here i have a little opening on the side so here it's not going to be stitched to that side so i can stitch this one to the second layer and then turn it then i can select my transform pattern tool select all of those pieces and then do in the 3d window or click right unfreeze and then click write again superimpose under everything should be stable or placed at least nicely and to make sure that you don't have any problems with collisions you can then simulate and it seems to be doing all right what i did not placed yet is going to be those two little pieces so first i'm going to also again stitch the sides here with the segment sewing tool so that it looks close from the inside and here too and then simulate and once all of this is stable i can hide my avatar to with shift a and then work a bit on the inside so here i'm going to be placing these little pieces inside here to stiffen a bit the opening of the bra so i will select first as you see here we have a baseline so i will trace it as an internal line by selecting the trace tool or through the trace tool so i select both baseline from both sides and press enter to transform them into internal lines once they are transformed then i can do the stitching again by selecting my segment sewing and then stitching those on the side so for the ones that are the um the stitching line that is stitched on both outline this one i will need to change the sewing line type to turn when you're stitching an internal line to a border you will not need to turn it will turn automatically because it will take in consideration that on an internal line automatically you will have your swingline type turn or you will press it flat with an iron as if it's in real life here and then here on the other side and then turn so once this is done we can also do the little pieces here it doesn't um need to be done now but we can still do it so that way we don't forget so we'll select the free sewing tool because here we don't have any point to stop so and i'm going to stitch those two pieces two bits together and here change the sewing line type here to turn and again here to turn here and then here since that is done we can use this option transform pattern or select move pattern then select both pieces here with the shift key click right to unfreeze and then click right again to superimpose under or superimpose them over so that they are inside the layer up to you however you want to show it but i will place it over instead so i will go back to my front and now we can get started by having a look at the breast pad and then afterwards i will of course change the fabric physical property so that it's a bit more realistic for this type of garment so to get started with the breast pad so we will not yet we will not delete what we've already worked on what we will just do is deactivate and then hide the pattern so that we can really have a full access to the human body so with your selection tool select all of your pattern pieces and then do a click right on one of them and select deactivate pattern and sewing then once that is done you can do another click right and then hide 3d pattern and now we see the avatar without anything so in order to start creating those pads we can i'm going to show you a tip a solution there's multiple ways of doing it but this is one way of doing so with the by drawing through the 3d pen avatar tool so if i select the 3d pen avatar tool i can then draw the pad and then i will extract it as a pattern so i can do it for one breast and then duplicate it for the other breast so i'm going to follow the line of the already existing brow that is on the texture of the skin of the avatar so i will start here then if i want to create a curve i will press my ctrl key and do a click left like this here if i want to go back to having a point i just release my control key and then do a click left and then move up at this point and then here i can add another um another little curve point by clicking on my curve of my ctrl key and then in order to finish my shape i will click where i started and now you see the shape is finished so usually you will have a seam on the shoulder pad to really catch the curve of the breast so you will then need to create a line in between so that it can create the proper shape for that pad so here i will create one like this in between press my ctrl key if i want to add a curve or make sure that it follows the curve of the breast and then here press my press with my left click all right since we have that now we can extract those shapes as patterns by using here the flatten tool so if you select flatten then you can select both shape you will see that it's highlighted in a blue and then yellow when you click on them and then press enter to extract them as pattern shape and here you have them appear in the 2d window so you can keep them separate if you want or if you want to modify them so that they feel a bit more like pads you can also add a point at the middle and then join one of the segments so here i can add a point here click on the select the add point split line tool and then we will add a point on the middle of that segment here and there so here i click right and i select the option uniform split and i press ok and i do the same on the other side click right and uniform split so we could add for example we could link the bottom part of the breastpad and then have them as one piece so i can select my edit pattern tool select both here both segments here and there click right on one of them and select the option merge and here i have one press pad and i could also add a bit of a curve at this here i will then select my edit curvature tool and curve it a bit more so here we have the base of our brass pad i can check if the sewings have been done no i see that it's not so i will then select my segment sewing and stitch both sides here so don't yet simulate because we have nothing to hold the brass pad so if you do it will then fall on the floor so what i can just suggest is that we will straight up duplicate this pattern for the other breasts and then activate again the bra so here i select it with my selection tool in a 2d window and i do ctrl d to duplicate it or the other option if you want to find the pop it's in the pop-up menu you do a click right and then a symmetric pattern with sewing as you see here you have also the shortcut placed on the side so i select this and i place it on the other side and in the 3d window just readjust the placement so that it fits nicely around the second breast like this we will then activate again the rest of the patterns for the bra so there is a few steps to follow and to make sure to follow in order so first is i'm going to show again all of the other patterns so here i select them in the 2d window i do a click right on one of the pieces and then select the option that is show 3d pattern or shift q now i see that they are present so as i said we will try to place the pads inside uh in between the third and the second layer so what i will do is i will use throughout all of those layers the layering tool or layering function in the property editor when you select the pattern so knowing that 0 means that it's to the closest of the body so i will keep this layer which is going to be sandwiching the pad and be close to the breast i will keep this one to layer zero then the pad comes next so i will place this one on layer one and then the rest i will place on layer two so that it goes on top of the pad but first let's deact let's reactivate the patterns so i will select all of those pattern and either in the 2d or 3d window click right on one of them and select the option activate then as i said so this one will stay as layer 0. then the pads will go as layer 1 which will then be changed in the property editor after selecting the pads you always have this message that appears asking letting you know that you're changing the layers of your pattern you just need to press ok and then i will select the rest of the patterns those those two other layers and then change that here as layer two in the property editor then press ok so here let's see what will happen so i can hide my avatar so you have a better view on the inside at this stage and then let's simulate and see what how it goes so it's end up going inside pretty well and you see that you have it's very stable in terms of the simulation so i can then stop the simulation and then select all of my patterns at once and then bring everything back to layer 0. which will bring all of the pattern piece again in this white color so once we've done that then we have the main construction and we can then start to look into the details and change the fabric physical property so again i have prepared a few fabrics already through the fabric library i just changed a bit of the print and the color to make it a little bit more personalized so i will go into a fabric folder which i just created for this purpose of the tutorial and then add those fabrics so this one i will add to my library this one as well for the waistband then this one for the main part of the of the bra and this one for the label which is this little piece here that i still haven't stitched on and that has fallen on the ground so um i will stitch it a little bit after i'll just add the fabric and then stitch it afterwards ideally we would have stitched it before so here then i will select the my waistband and then add the fabric of my waistband drag and drop it onto my waistband here then for the main i will select the top part here and place this fabric right here and the rest here is for the lining on the inside of the fabric so this one here and select the rest i can also maybe to add a bit of variety add this fabric on the top here so once this is done just to make sure that you calculate the physical properties properly then simulate and then yes you should be able to see that the bra changes a little bit of its drape i can then stop the simulation and then also because as you see here i do have my fabric for i do have some pads but i didn't add any specific physical property so on the fabric that remains the fabric one i can change the names into pads and add a physical property that kind of fits the purpose of those pads so i will then go down in the property editor and then in the physical property change the preset into something that's i would say fits approximately to those pads and i will select the trim fusible rigid and then simulate to see how the the drape changes here we have it yes so then i can go back to my little label and then change and add edit to my here so i will then stitch it with my free sewing tool here and then change the sewing line type into turn so that my label sticks inside my bra then i will take my selection tool click right on the little label that fell on the floor and then select superimpose under and then it will be placed underneath and i can of course change the fabric so i would select my label fabric drag and drop it and then simulate and you can stop quickly the simulation as it's just to place this little piece right here so once we're done with that we have done the main components of our bra so then we can make it ready for a high quality render you can also add some top stitches if you want or some decoration on top i will not do this so that i make the video concise to the point of constructing this bra i will then just make sure to change the resolution as this is these pattern pieces are quite small so it is very important to change um the particle distance as well as the collision and there's a little bit of some tricks um regarding the pads on which type of in which value you could change the thickness collision so for all those bras so instead of i will not use the high-res button just because with this one changes overall and i want to customize a little bit the resolution of each pattern so here for all of them already i'm just going to change everything to a particle distance five so i select all of my patterns and here i change the value of the particle distance to five i can then simulate to make sure that everything works out fine when i see that everything is stable then i can also change the thickness collision so this one i will do little by little one layer by one layer so i will select first the first layer and change the thickness collision here to one like this and then simulate as you see it's important to go little by little just to make sure that um it doesn't collide too much as you see now it's quite stable so i can stop the simulation and then select the second layer and then again change this collision to one so if you're scared that it might collide too much you can go little by little so here i can select to two and then simulate if this is then stable then i can change to two to two to one point five and then simulate and then from 1.5 to 1. and then again simulate once this is stable then we can do the same with our last layer so here i can again select all of the patterns change little by little so i can change here the thickness collision to two once it's stable then i can select again change that to 1.5 and then from 1.5 to 1. all right and it looks stable from all sides so then we can go on and change the collision of the pads so because our patterns here at the moment is quite thin and if you want to add a little bit of thickness on the pad um you would actually do it through the thickness collision so the more collision you add then the more thick your pads will appear so for example if i want to make it a little bit thicker around for to protect my breast a little bit better i can change here the value from 2.5 to let's say three and then simulate and then three to let's say 3.5 and i will go like this until four simulate you see that it's actually growing a little bit the shape and now i'll change that to four and i see yeah and you can also if you want the visual aspect to also have this look of being a bit thicker you can change that in the thickness rendering so if your collision is four i wouldn't suggest to have a thickness rendering above four because otherwise it will look um as if it's the fabric is going through a bit so i would suggest you can go from anywhere between zero and four so for me i'm just going to make it thicker and place it to three it's not going to change much of the drape because this is just a visual change that you're bringing and then simulate to make sure again that everything is stable what will then remain is to change the avatar skinner set as well as the simulation arrow to make it into a fitting mode so i can bring back the avatar by with shift a and then select the skin of the avatar and make sure that we change this from three to zero once that is done you can simulate to make sure that everything is stable if it is then that's good and then the last little thing to make it into a high-res mode you will then change the simulation arrow from normal to fitting and then simulate and let it sit for a little bit you will see that it's going to change a bit more due to the elasticity of the fabric once you see that it's stable then you can stop your simulation and then double check around to make sure that everything looks good yeah it seems to be looking good i will place my camera again on the front view and stop the simulation and here we go here we have our bra so this is basically um the main construction workflow to build this uh type of bra of course i did not add the top stitch and the graphics so these are more like material aspects so i will leave them on the side but you can of course do it on your own if you want and let me then share with you the final render where i also added the top stitches and the graphic i hope you found this video helpful and if you have any questions or any comments please feel free to write in the chat below thank you very much for watching ",
        "Summary": "# Comprehensive Guide to Constructing a Sports Bra with Breast Pads This guide provides step-by-step instructions on constructing a sports bra using pre-made patterns, creating breast pads from scratch, and incorporating them into the bra. It also includes definitions, tips, and tricks for a successful project. ## Table of Contents 1. **Introduction** 2. **Materials Needed** 3. **Loading Patterns** 4. **Arranging Patterns** 5. **Sewing the Sports Bra** 6. **Creating Breast Pads** 7. **Layering and Final Adjustments** 8. **Changing Fabric Properties** 9. **Finalizing the Design** 10. **Tips and Tricks** 11. **Conclusion** --- ### 1. Introduction In this tutorial, you will learn how to: - Load sports bra patterns. - Arrange and sew the patterns. - Create breast pads that will fit inside the sports bra. - Adjust fabric properties for realism. ### 2. Materials Needed - Pre-made sports bra patterns (DXF format). - 3D modeling software (e.g., Clo3D or Marvelous Designer). - Avatar model for fitting. - Fabric swatches for your design. - Basic sewing tools within the software. ### 3. Loading Patterns 1. **Download the Patterns**: Obtain the DXF file from the provided link. 2. **Load Patterns**: - Right-click on the file in your workspace. - Choose the option to \"Add\" while keeping the scale on \"Auto Scale.\" - Uncheck \"Annotation\" and swap \"Cutting Line\" and \"Sewing Lines\" if necessary. - Click \"OK\" to load the patterns. ### 4. Arranging Patterns 1. **Identify Layers**: Understand that your patterns consist of multiple layers: - Layer 1: Shell Layer - Layer 2: Second Layer - Layer 3: Padding Layer 2. **Freeze Layers**: Select the second and third layers and freeze them using the transform pattern tool. 3. **Use Arrangement Points**: - Zoom in on the avatar in the 3D window. - Press Shift + F to show arrangement points. - Place the front, side, back, and waistband patterns using the arrangement points. 4. **Hide Arrangement Points**: Once patterns are positioned correctly, hide the arrangement points. ### 5. Sewing the Sports Bra 1. **Select the Sewing Tool**: Use the segment sewing tool in the 2D window. 2. **Sew Patterns**: Start stitching: - Sew the sides, front, back, and waistband. - If needed, use the 3D window to adjust sewing lines. 3. **Simulate**: Press the simulation arrow or spacebar to see the bra drape on the avatar. Adjust if necessary. ### 6. Creating Breast Pads 1. **Deactivate Existing Patterns**: Hide the bra patterns to access the avatar. 2. **Draw the Breast Pad**: - Select the 3D Pen Avatar tool. - Trace the shape of the breast pad directly on the avatar. 3. **Extract as Pattern**: - Use the flatten tool to convert your drawing into a pattern. 4. **Modify the Breast Pad**: Add curves and merge segments as necessary for shape and stability. ### 7. Layering and Final Adjustments 1. **Layering the Breast Pads**: - Set the breast pads to layer 1 and the bra layers to layer 0 (closest to the body). - Simulate to check the placement and stability of the pads. 2. **Final Adjustments**: Ensure all patterns are well-stitched and fit correctly. ### 8. Changing Fabric Properties 1. **Select Fabric**: Choose fabric swatches for each layer of the bra. 2. **Change Physical Properties**: - Adjust the particle distance, collision thickness, and rendering properties for realism. - Simulate after each adjustment to ensure stability. 3. **Label**: Add a label and adjust its properties similarly. ### 9. Finalizing the Design 1. **Final Render**: Set up your camera for a good view of the bra. 2. **Add Details**: You can add top stitches or graphical elements as desired. 3. **High-Resolution Simulation**: Change the simulation settings to high-res and fitting mode for the final look. ### 10. Tips and Tricks - **Layer Management**: Keep layers organized for easier manipulation. - **Simulation Testing**: Regularly simulate to check stability. - **Adjustments**: Don’t hesitate to go back and make adjustments during any stage. - **Fabric Choices**: Choose fabrics that reflect the intended use of the sports bra for better realism. ### 11. Conclusion You have successfully constructed a sports bra complete with breast pads. This guide covers the entire process from loading patterns to finalizing your design. Always feel free to experiment with different designs and fabrics to make the project your own. If you have any questions or feedback, please leave a comment below. Happy sewing!"

        "Transcript": "hi everyone and welcome to another tips and tricks with khloe today we will be going through garment fitmaps i will walk you through all the different processes on how to understand and read your fitmaps as well as how to conduct a workflow using fitmaps to ensure you have the best fitted garment possible so let's begin when it comes to garment fitting most of your work is done within the 3d window you use the garment fitmaps which are allocated in the 3d toggle bar to help you do so the four main fitmaps are the stress map the strain map fit map and lastly pressure points each map is used to give you a different preview of your fitting here is an overview of what the fitmaps look like and i will now show you how to read and understand each one some tips to share with you before we dive into fit maps by hovering over one of the fit maps you will get a preview of the fitmap name alongside the shortcut for example stress map is alt 6 you can preview the fit maps individually unfortunately they cannot all be previewed together however with a fit map you are able to also preview the pressure points at the same time the first garment fitmap that i will go through will be the stress map the stress map shows the external stress causing the garment to distort as a result the garment itself is exerting pressure stress in other words the stress map is showing how much pressure is in the fabric per section which is resulting from a tight fitting garment kilo pascal also known as kpa is a pressure unit that describes the tear resistance the maximum stress the material can withstand is represented as a unit kpa of pressure when it's stretched before the fabric rips the stress map itself appears in eight colors with blue indicating zero stress while red indicates a stronger stress by selecting any part of your pattern you will also get the measurement of that kpa on a particular point as you can see the kpa can be represented above 100. now let's explore this theory a little bit more with the example on our screen on our screen we have the same garment in different sizes one on two different avatars also varied in sizes the only difference between these two styles is the fabric the garment on the left is using the silk knit jersey whereas the garment on the right is using the nylon stretch the physical properties of the silk knit jersey allows more stretch in the garment to sit on the avatar without distorting whereas the nylon stretch fabric has some stretch but is still showing extreme points of distortion now let's see how these garments would perform if they were using the alternate fabric i will select my pattern pieces and assign the other fabric to it in order to see the changes on the fitmaps in the 3d window i must simulate in between every fabric change by applying and swapping around the fabrics i can see that it's not the garment causing the stress but the fabric itself now this isn't necessarily a problem if i'm working on a compression garment such as a sports running outfit or maybe lingerie because here i actually want to see my fabric adding compression in certain areas to ensure a tight fit and garment where it will support the wearer we can explore this a little bit further in our next map the next map is the strain map the strain map shows the external stress causing the garment to distort as a result the garment itself is being stretched the strain map measures how far is being stretched to its capacity in other words how much is the garment being stretched when worn the strain map also appears in eight colors with blue indicating no distortion rate at around 100 percent whereas red indicates 120 and maximum distortion the numbers in between are also expressed in a gradation of colors by clicking on the point of the garment you will also get the percentage of distortion at that exact position now when comparing the strain map on the two garments i can see that both garments are tight-fitting causing a lot of strain as you can see the garment on the right which is using this silk knit jersey which showed no distortion in the stress map is now showing a lot of distortion in the strain map again depending on your product category this may not be a problem if you want compression and support on your garment however by looking at this garment i can see that i might need to make some patent amendments to the underarm and sleeve as well as around the neck to ensure that the wearer isn't restricted the next map is the fit map the fit map shows how each fabric has a maximum distortion the value of each distortion is determined by the stretch shin and stiffness of the physical properties within the fabric the physical properties of the fabric can be found once you select the fabric within the object browser and scroll a bit further down to physical properties here under detail you will see all the measurements that build up your fabric based on the stretch bending and buckling of your fabric the value of the fit map is a percentage of how much the fabric has been stretched relative to its maximum distortion 100 the fabric is being stretched to its maximum distortion zero percent the fabric is not stretched this is also indicated in color with red representing card wear which indicates more than a hundred percent whereas yellow representing tight fitting is usually more than 80 anything below 80 percent is indicated in white the table here in the top right corner indicates in percentage of the total garment that has can't wear versus tight fitting spots across the whole garment the fit map is only calculated in areas where the fabric and the avatar are in direct contact again by clicking on any point of the garment you will get the exact level percentage relative to the spot that you click on the last option under garment fitmaps is show pressure point by showing the pressure points you can see the exact points of contact between the garment and the avatar therefore if i want everything to be next to skin i want to be seeing a completely blue garment if i want to see anything floaty and flowy i would ideally not see any blue points now let's explore the garment fit properties a little bit further in order to understand how the garment fit properties work we need to go to the main toolbar to preferences and garment fit properties from here the garment fit property window will appear and now we can change the range unit and appearance of our garment fitmaps let's explore the garment fit properties a little bit further the first option is type as you can see you can filter between stress strain and fit maps the second option is the range color counts the range color counts sets the number of colors to indicate the stress and strain map this is not available for fitmap the first option within the chart is range the range shows you the stress strain and fitmap range based on the number of colors from the range color counts the next option is units for stress map you can filter between the three units of your choice however the strain and fit map are only shown in percentage the next option is the color you can choose and filter between which colors you would like to see to represent each range by selecting a new color you can apply that to the range the next option is opacity you can choose how opaque you would like to see your garment fitmap moving on from the charts we can go down to graph type the first option is to see the difference between the gradation of the mesh and the column compared to seeing it in a full section you can also filter between seeing the mesh either as a face in which the whole map is filled in or you can choose to see the color in points you can then choose which areas of your 3d garment you would like to see whether it's the weft or sheer once you have made any changes if you would like to reset back to the default settings that chloe offers you can click on reset here when working with the garmin fit properties you should also take into consideration the fabric properties you are using the garment fitmaps with lower the percentage value for very stretchy fabrics this way you can see smaller areas of stretch and then you should raise the percentage value for non-stretchy fabrics you can adjust the stress strain and fit maps according to your fabric as an example i will raise the percentage value for this non-stretch fabric here as you can see from raising the percentage value for all the stress strain and fit maps i'm getting a better indication on the fit of my fabric compared to the garment now let's explore the option the other way around when working with very stretchy fabrics i need to actually lower the kpa as you can see by lowering the percentage value i am seeing more points of stress and strain which is giving me more of an accurate fit map now let's move on to applying these theories into a workflow before jumping into your virtual fitting you need to have all the correct components to ensure an accurate fit starting with the fabric in best practices you will have the same digital fabric as your real fabric in order to do this you will need to measure your real fabric using the clo fabric kit the fabric kit measures the stretch bending buckling and weight of your fabric based on the warp weft and bias for stretchy fabrics you will need to take a range of stretch test distances you can then put all this information into the clothes emulator to create your digital fabric you can then apply the fabrics that you're going to use next you need to ensure your avatar is the right size the same way you would fit your garment on the correct fit model you can adjust your avatar size by using the avatar editor found in the main toolbar from here you can type in all the measurements of your size spec to meet your fit model's measurements if you were using a 3d scan of your model you can also bring that obj into chloe and use the auto convert to avatar to rig your avatar by doing this you will be able to use close features such as x-ray joints after this you can bring in any additional garments that you would like to fit with ensure you place every garment on the correct layer that you like once you have done layering ensure that all your layers are back to zero to assist in the fitting of your garment you sometimes need to adjust the position of the garment either by turning on simulation and pulling the garment accordingly or by using the avatar tapes found in the 3d toolbar before using these i'm going to ensure that i have all my correct drawing lines turned on from here i will use the basic tape measure to draw a line where i would like my shoulder seam to be placed to do this i click once where i want to start and double click where i want to finish here i can select the attach to measure tape select the seam line that i would like to attach to this newly drawn line i click once for the seam line and once for the tape from here i need to simulate in order to see the changes as you can see my shoulder seam is now adjusted to the correct position i will repeat the same for any other seam lines i would like to adjust at this point you can change the pose of your avatar by using the pose folder within the avatars folder you can simply double click to use a pre-made one given to you by clove or you can actually use the x-ray joints found in the 3d toggle bar from here you can turn on your ik joints and manipulate the avatar into the position of your choice make sure you turn on simulation when adjusting the ik joints this way the garment will move at the same time as the avatar lastly you need to ensure you're in a high-risk garment to ensure an accurate fits you can do so by using the high-res garment tool found in the 3d toolbar under simulation quality you would ideally use fitting accuracy as your simulation property always ensure you simulate between every fabric or pattern change as my fabrics have a slight level of stretch i think it's necessary to adjust my garment fitmap properties to ensure i have an accurate fit in order to do this i will go to preferences garment fit properties and raise the percentage value of both the stress strain and fit maps to ensure i have an accurate fit now that i have adjusted my garment parameters i can do an accurate fitting on my garment i will first start with the stress map since i have changed the stress garment fit properties i can now see that there is little to no distortion on my fabric there's a slight amount of distortion around the crotch area but this could be due to the pose that my avatar is currently in i will change my pose in a short while just to check i will now review the stress map next to the strain map when changing to the strain map i can see that there is a lot of red which is showing some level of distortion however when clicking on actual points on my garment i can see that my percentage rate is actually below my maximum distortion of 130 therefore i am not so worried about the actual fit of the garment when i compare the strain map with the stress map i can see that there is zero to little distortion when using this fabric with these patterns but just to confirm this i will check this with the fitmap now when looking at the fitmap i can see that there are some points of can't wear around the waist and around the upper thigh however this percentage is relatively small only at 7.4 percent and the 74 point percent is only representative of any part of the garment that actually comes into contact with the avatar therefore around the bust you won't actually get the percentage so the seven four point percent is actually quite small the only point of concern i might have at the moment is around the thigh however when comparing to the other thigh i can see that there is absolutely no stress or strain there therefore i will consider reviewing this again when i adjust my avatar into a new pose using the poses in the library i will adjust my avatar into a new pose for people with particularly slow hardware you might want to consider going into low resolution in order to change your pose a bit more quickly you can then go back into high resolution in order to do an accurate fit now that i have changed the pose of my avatar i can see that my current wear percentage has dropped down to three percent showing that overall this is a garment that is suitable with the fabric that i have chosen if i just double check this with my other fitmaps such as a strain map and the stress map i can see that there is zero to little distortion anymore especially in areas that i was worried about such as the thigh and waist now that i have finished all the parameters and setting of my garment fitmaps i might want to share the outcome with my team especially if i cannot do a virtual fitting or live fitting with my team in order to do so i will use snapshots to find my snapshots i will go to file snapshot 3d window from here i can create snapshots of my 3d window when using snapshots i can do single view on multi-view with multi-view i can choose to do either a custom view by zooming into particular points and taking a snapshot using the camera here or i can use one of the default views either front three-quarter left or back like so i can set the parameters of my image size using either a preset or defining the width and height i would like i can raise the resolution if i want to however this is just a snapshot of your 3d window therefore you will not get a high quality render you can choose as well how many view counts you would like to do i'm currently using four however you can do up to 10. you can also choose to save it with a transparent background either as separate images and if you have colorways you can also choose to do that once you are happy with your preview you can press save your file will then save in your folder and from here you can open up the png to get a preview of your garmin fit maps you can repeat the same for all your other garment fitmaps such as stress and fitmap thank you for watching these tips and tricks on garment fitmaps i hope you now understand how to use garment fitting with inklow please don't forget to like and subscribe to our youtube channel for

        "Summary": "# Comprehensive Guide to Garment Fitmaps ## Introduction Garment fitmaps are essential tools used in the fashion and textile industry to ensure that garments fit well and meet design specifications. This guide will walk you through the different types of fitmaps, how to read them, and how to apply this knowledge in a practical workflow to achieve the best-fitted garments. ## Definitions 1. **Garment Fitmaps**: Visual tools that display how well a garment fits on an avatar or model, indicating areas of stress, strain, and pressure. 2. **Stress Map**: Shows the external stress causing the garment to distort, indicating the pressure in the fabric. 3. **Strain Map**: Measures how much the garment is stretched and displays the stretching capacity of the fabric. 4. **Fit Map**: Indicates the maximum distortion a fabric can withstand relative to its physical properties. 5. **Pressure Points**: Points of contact between the garment and the avatar, indicating how closely the garment fits the body. ## Types of Fitmaps ### 1. Stress Map - **Purpose**: Indicates the external stress on the garment. - **Color Indicators**: - **Blue**: 0 stress - **Red**: Strong stress (indicating areas at risk of distortion) - **Measurement Unit**: Kilopascal (kPa) - **How to Read**: Hover over sections to see kPa measurements; areas above 100 kPa indicate significant stress. ### 2. Strain Map - **Purpose**: Shows how far the garment is stretched. - **Color Indicators**: - **Blue**: No distortion (0%) - **Red**: Maximum distortion (120% and above) - **How to Read**: Click on points to see the percentage of distortion. ### 3. Fit Map - **Purpose**: Displays how much the fabric has been stretched relative to its maximum capacity. - **Color Indicators**: - **Red**: More than 100% (can't wear) - **Yellow**: More than 80% (tight fitting) - **White**: Below 80% (loose fit) - **How to Read**: Click on specific areas to see the percentage of distortion. ### 4. Pressure Points - **Purpose**: Displays contact points between the garment and the avatar. - **Ideal View**: A completely blue garment indicates a snug fit. ## Step-by-Step Instructions for Using Fitmaps 1. **Accessing Fitmaps**: - Open the 3D window in your garment design software. - Locate the fitmaps in the 3D toggle bar. 2. **Understanding Fitmaps**: - Hover over each fitmap to preview its name and shortcut (e.g., Stress Map is `Alt + 6`). - Individual fitmaps can be previewed but not simultaneously, except for pressure points. 3. **Analyzing Stress Map**: - Observe the color representation and kPa measurements. - Compare different fabric types on the same garment to determine fabric behavior. 4. **Examining Strain Map**: - Identify areas of significant stretching. - Note any potential issues in fit based on strain percentages. 5. **Evaluating Fit Map**: - Check the overall percentage of can't wear and tight-fitting areas. - Focus on areas in direct contact with the avatar. 6. **Viewing Pressure Points**: - Check for blue areas indicating snug fits or areas that need adjustments. ## Tips and Tricks - **Adjusting Garment Fit Properties**: - Access the preferences menu to adjust range units, color settings, and opacity for better visibility. - Modify settings based on the fabric type; lower settings for stretchy fabrics and higher for non-stretchy ones. - **Conducting Accurate Fit Tests**: - Ensure your fabric and avatar are accurately represented in the software. - Use the Clo fabric kit to measure real fabric properties for digital replication. - **Utilizing Avatar Editor**: - Correctly size your avatar using the avatar editor. - Use 3D scans of models for accurate fitting. - **Simulation**: - Always simulate after any changes to see real-time effects. - Use high-resolution settings for accurate fit adjustments. - **Snapshot Feature**: - Use the snapshot feature to save images of your fitmaps for team sharing or documentation. - Customize view settings and resolution for clear presentation. ## Workflow Steps for Virtual Fitting 1. **Prepare Your Fabric**: Create a digital version of your fabric using the Clo fabric kit. 2. **Avatar Adjustment**: Ensure your avatar matches the intended fit model. 3. **Layering Garments**: Correctly layer garments for fitting. 4. **Measurement Tools**: Use the basic tape measure to adjust seam lines. 5. **Pose Adjustment**: Utilize the pose library and IK joints for realistic avatar positioning. 6. **Simulate Changes**: Continuously simulate after adjustments. 7. **Review Fitmaps**: Analyze stress, strain, and fit maps for final adjustments. 8. **Share Outcomes**: Use snapshots to document and share fitting results with your team. ## Conclusion Understanding and effectively using garment fitmaps is crucial for achieving well-fitted garments in the fashion industry. By following this comprehensive guide, you can navigate the complexities of fitmaps, make informed decisions about garment adjustments, and streamline your fitting workflow. Remember to practice regularly to enhance your skills and efficiency in garment fitting."

        "Transcript": "hi and welcome to another tutorial in this tutorial you will learn how to properly use the uv editor the first thing which you want to do is to change our layout from simulation to uv editor by changing the layout the 2d window will disappear and be replaced by another window with baked uvs you have the possibility to combine different textures of fabrics which can include many different texture maps into one baked uv this will reduce the file size and help other software to easily read your exported comments first it might look similar but there are different buttons available now before we take a closer look into the different uv texture channels i want to give you an overview of the interface here you can see the different tiles going to the positive plus 1 and negative -1 direction each tile represents one texture space and can be either used by one or multiple pattern pieces if we click right onto the empty space then we have a few options to select to get rid of overlapping pieces we simply can select reset to 2d arrangement to get an exact copy of our placement of the 2d window now it's easier for us to select individual pattern pieces for the fine tuning if we click right again in the empty space we can now fit all the pattern pieces inside the first tile by selecting fit all 0 to 1. as we can see we do have a lot of empty space in our texture space if we manage to place all the pattern pieces all together as big as possible inside one tile then we achieve the best resolution for each exported texture map so let's arrange them in a squared formation similar like the transform pattern tool you can rotate and even scale pattern pieces if you scale up one pattern piece then the texture quality of this pattern piece will be better as you can see our uvs for the buttons and top stitches are also included and have to be placed nicely as well and close as possible to the other pattern pieces once we are done we can right click into the empty space again and fit all the uvs to 0 1 again now the arrangement looks way better with less empty space with the toggle bar on the top left corner of our uv editor you can click through all the different texture channels which were applied to your fabric and which can be exported as unified uv maps if we take a closer look at the normal map of our puckering and the normal map of our fabric we can see that the blending mode doesn't look good in this case we can change our normal blending method in our user settings to udn and many other options other blending methods need some further adjustments for the intensity inside of our puckering in order to make them visible that's why i increase it up to 100. on the top left corner we do have the uv snapshot button here you can save a quick screenshot of the uv wireframe which can be used for any image editing software in order to create other texture maps or do some changes anti-aliasing will simply smooth out the edges of the wireframe the uv area defines which tiles you want to export you can either only export the first tile if you placed all the pattern pieces there but if you decide to split up the uv maps into several ties then you can also define which tiles you want to export the second button is finally to bake our textures into the different uv texture maps the higher the resolution the better the quality but in return the file size will increase a lot so keep this in mind if you need a small file size for example when using it for real-time graphic engines same as before you can decide if you only want to export the first tile or if you want to export several since you've split up your arrangement into multiple tiles you can also add some additional pixels at the edge to make sure that you don't accidentally cut off the texture due to mesh issues just make sure that you don't have any overlapping if you want to use this feature at least you can select which texture channels you want to bake i will select all of them and also pick the file path and click on save an easy way how to split up your uvs into several tiles is by selecting the pattern pieces which goes to another tile and right click onto them and say fit all your v's to 0 one confirm and place them inside another tile keep in mind that you will have twice as many texture maps now now let's change our layout mode back to simulation and create a new fabric also make sure that you changed your 3d window to the quality render mode we apply all the different uvs to its texture channels and then we assign this new fabric to all of our pattern pieces first it will look weird but once we change the texture mapping from flat mapping to unified mapping everything looks fine the only thing which needs to be adjusted is the reflection intensity and roughness the material type and the intensity of the normal map and displacement map now we've combined multiple fabrics onto one fabric and we can use our baked uv texture maps for other 3d applications as well thank you for listening and follow our youtube channel for more updates you ",

This guide provides step-by-step instructions, definitions, tips, and tricks to help you achieve high-quality results while minimizing file sizes. ## Table of Contents 1. **Changing the Layout** 2. **Understanding the UV Editor Interface** 3. **Arranging UVs** 4. **Working with Texture Channels** 5. **Baking Textures** 6. **Exporting UV Maps** 7. **Final Adjustments and Configuration** 8. **Tips and Tricks** --- ### 1. Changing the Layout **Step-by-Step Instructions:** 1. Open your 3D application. 2. Locate the layout options (often found in the top menu). 3. Change the layout from \"Simulation\" to \"UV Editor.\" 4. Observe that the 2D window disappears and is replaced with a UV layout window. **Definition:** - **Layout:** The arrangement of different panels and tools in your workspace. ### 2. Understanding the UV Editor Interface **Overview:** - The UV Editor displays a grid representing texture spaces, usually labeled with positive (+1) and negative (-1) coordinates. - Each tile in the grid can represent a texture space for one or multiple pattern pieces. **Step-by-Step Instructions:** 1. Familiarize yourself with the grid layout. 2. Right-click on empty spaces to access options for arranging patterns. **Key Options:** - **Reset to 2D Arrangement:** Resets your UVs to their original 2D placement. - **Fit All (0 to 1):** Automatically fits all pattern pieces within the first tile. ### 3. Arranging UVs **Step-by-Step Instructions:** 1. Select individual pattern pieces and arrange them in a compact formation. 2. Utilize the transform tools to rotate or scale pattern pieces as needed. 3. Aim to minimize empty space in the texture area for better resolution. **Tips:** - Group similar patterns together for a cleaner layout. - Ensure UVs for smaller details (like buttons) are also properly placed. ### 4. Working with Texture Channels **Step-by-Step Instructions:** 1. Use the toggle bar in the top left corner to navigate through different texture channels (e.g., diffuse, normal maps). 2. Adjust blending methods and intensity settings in user preferences to ensure optimal visibility. **Key Settings:** - **Normal Blending Method:** Adjust this to UDN or others as required. - **Intensity:** Increase the intensity of normal maps for better visibility. ### 5. Baking Textures **Step-by-Step Instructions:** 1. Click the UV Snapshot button to save a screenshot of the UV wireframe for image editing. 2. Decide on the resolution of your textures based on your project needs; higher resolutions yield better quality but larger file sizes. 3. Choose which tiles to export, ensuring there are no overlapping UVs before baking. **Tip:** - Consider adding border pixels to avoid texture cutoff issues. ### 6. Exporting UV Maps **Step-by-Step Instructions:** 1. In the export settings, select the desired texture channels to bake. 2. Specify the file path for saving your exported maps. 3. Click save to complete the process. ### 7. Final Adjustments and Configuration **Step-by-Step Instructions:** 1. Change the layout mode back to \"Simulation.\" 2. Create a new fabric and assign your baked UV texture maps to the appropriate channels. 3. Adjust the texture mapping settings from \"Flat Mapping\" to \"Unified Mapping.\" **Key Adjustments:** - Modify reflection intensity, roughness, and material types as needed. - Tweak the intensity of normal and displacement maps for desired effects. ### 8. Tips and Tricks - **Organize UVs Efficiently:** Keep your UV maps tidy to avoid confusion later. - **Regularly Check Texture Quality:** Use high-resolution maps when possible, but balance with file size for real-time applications. - **Utilize UV Snapshots:** Keep a record of your UV layouts for future reference or adjustments. - **Practice Good Naming Conventions:** Name your texture files and maps clearly to maintain organization. --- ## Conclusion With this comprehensive guide, you should feel confident in using the UV Editor to manage and optimize your textures effectively.

        "Transcript": "hey everyone thank you for watching this tutorial today i would like present a basic network flow by adding some tips and tricks and i will guide you through thanks for watching this let's start with the first thing which is the right fabric choice in this example i'm using the default fabric at the moment because i assembled first the patterns together but of course i need the right fabric and this is one knit and i'm just simply go to our library and we search for the right knit quality i can also type in knit here and to see all the qualities which comes with the software and yes i have as you can see always a preview how the knits it's going to drape and look like and it's always a combination of the physical properties and as well as the visual aspects in this case my achieved design is actually more a heavier knit and in this case i'm going to use the terry the terry comes already with the right texture on top but this is not the texture i actually would like to use i'm just going to change this afterwards just that you can see here here's the texture in the meanwhile i can also simulate see how the drapes yeah i'm very happy with that and now i can simply going to change my knit design with a different texture for this i already prepared a few things and this i will going to show you now so what we need are different maps and i have a little overview which maps we need first of all we need the color map so the color map actually gives you the color information of our texture and then we have our normal map so the normal map is the second most important map after the texture map and it has like a bombiness or a bump effect and it is actually called in other 3d software as a bump map and this one actually generates like a surface which has some wrinkles or for instance weaves or scratches and especially it is giving you a more depth feeling of often it next to it we have the roughness map and this map will help you to control the light information making your fabric look more or less reflective our last map is the displacement map and this is a map which physically displaces and tessellates the measure of the 3d garment to which it is applied and it also gives you an illusion of the depths of the fabric so it is as you see a grayscale image and the darker tones will represent the button of the fabric and the lighter tones will represent the highest peaks so in this term it has definitely a good function for a knit so in this way you can express the yarn shape a little better when you use the displacement map in the next step we are going to use the different maps and here i can show you how a combination of all the maps would look like as a cpap file yes i will guide you through how you can use know all the different maps in khloe first of all we can select our new terry and then we will replace the texture map with our column up appear we just simply drag and drop on top of it and there we go we can already see the structure now we have to apply all the different maps as well and because i would like to scale it i would need to put them all together at the first time i will show you why let's say i like to change the texture here like something like that and i going to now open my library going to use my normal map and then you see that the it's like the shadows is a little bit off and i can also see in the transformation texture and normal map have different sizings so in this term we have to do all the maps first like putting them into clone and afterwards we can then scale it so i'm just going to do it again using my texture color map then i'm using my normal map and if you don't have a normal map in case you can also do a lot of different things when you want to have a nice knit texture you can also create your own normal map through claw let's say you have your color map you simply need to use this ruler here that would be also a possibility but we have a normal map so i'm just going to use this one then we have a displacement map first of all i have to change the map and then i can do the roughness map here now we have all the maps we need and i have now the ability to change the scaling as i said i will just use the texture scaling with um added texture t and i'm just going to make the loops a little bit smaller yeah something like until i will find the right yeah the right size of my fabric okay now i have it and i can already have a preview so what i'm doing when i'm selecting different fabrics and sizings and so on i'm also double check in the render engine as well to see if it is going in the right direction let's say yeah i think that's from the sizing something i was looking for and then i would just going to continue with that and what else we have is for sure we have here a rip here here as well and i will apply a rip and afterwards i will go through the settings i will do the same quality for the rip and i will use a copy for that and i'm just going to change these names knit and not rip and here i'm going to do chunky okay now i will apply this in this to a rip okay so in the next step we're going to apply the right knit rip so yeah i have the same c fabfi so i would just use the right quality for that so i'm going to our fabric library i'm going to look for the right rib or the one i like to use so we have different qualities you always get kind of like a preview how it looks like and i would like to have one which is a little bit more heavier so this one just going to drag and drop and then you can see the rip here but i'm going to use another texture on top so i have the quality but the texture should be a different one i can also simulate you see now how the drapes is working now and i'm just using another texture for that so i prepared a rib texture it's also a red one but yeah i will maybe change the color i'm just going to first put now all the maps one by one and then also their normal map now i can scale it here you can see and i'm just trying to match the loops so you see we have two loops one here and one here like a string of right loops and i just need to match those string together with this one so that it becomes more realistic okay so i'm just going to do that i'm going to make it a little smaller yeah maybe a little bit smaller i can also make it in percentage maybe one percent smaller that looks quite good and then trying to match it also this one i'm trying to put it a little bit more down so that the left loops turned into right loops yeah i think that's looking fine so far maybe i can still do it a little bit smaller okay trying to match it as as much as i can and then i just going to leave it as it is now good uh yes and texturized like the color i'm just gonna decelerate that and i will have the correct color the one i'd like to have i think that's nice and then i'm going to put the right fur qualities and yes and also a little bit of displacement map now we come to the point where we're going to make use of our displacement map and we do this both for the knit chunky and for the rip i'm just going for the rip going to the displacement and going to amount here and yeah i would say between one or two millimeters and i will do the same for the knit chunky and then i have a look in the render engine to see if it's something i'm achieving just have a look yeah it looks fine so far i will apply some fur later i can also check if i maybe want to change a bit of the displacement map here so we can also make it a little more intense yeah so that's now a little bit more intense the stripes we have here okay then i will go to the next which is the fur before we go into the properties i would like to explain the different properties so we have the length which is the length of the hair thickness which is the circumference of one hair then the band you can go between 0 and 1 and you see the higher the value is the heavier is the hair so it's like falling then we have the taper which describes the root compared to the end of the hair so if you have a value which is zero then you see that the thickness on the end of the hair is the way it is on the root and if you have a taper which is one then the tip of the hair will be thinner additionally we have density and segments so the density describes how many individual hair we have per inch and then we have the segments so the hair is made of different segments as you can see here the higher the value of the segment is the best way you can actually also describes curls because the more segments you have the curlier your hair will be okay let's jump to our example select the knit chunky and the fabric type is always by default matte when i'm using the drop down menu i get more options and the one i need is the furrender only afterwards it's usually like that that the material has the same properties for back and for back it totally makes sense to have the same appearance also from the inside but we don't need this for the side so i'm just going to take it off and change it to matte otherwise we will keep really a lot of our performance and it's easier when we just lower it down wherever we can just going back to the front we have fur presets which different qualities and of course those ones you don't need to use them because it's like real fur and because we have just the knit and we would like to express a little bit of hairiness i would recommend to use the terry coth from there we can start changing the values to make it more realistic so i'm using this one and afterwards i'm going to first shape and then the base and change the values here so length thickness bend taper density and segments so basically the points i explained before because this fur is just visible in the rendering we need to open the render window to see the changes we do in the base here but for that i don't need to use all my patterns so just the sum of them otherwise i'm also keep the the performance very busy and i just going to lower that down so i'm going to invert this and hide my pattern in the next step we go to our render window and activate the render engine to see now our garment i can zoom in so that we can better see the fur properties and as you can see now it is quite dense and so we're just going to change a little bit of the settings here so in this regard we go to our property editor and we will do some changes under for base we have base and here we have a length of 0.2 cm and we're just going to make it less in the length so 0.5 because we just want to have a little bit of hairiness as well as the thickness is a little bit too much also here we're just going to reduce it by 100 i will keep the band and the taper for now just have a look first the density per inch is also quite a lot and here i'm just going to change it by 111 yes and now it gets the look i want to achieve like this little hairiness i have here can zoom in and have a look but i think i'm already quite happy with the result yeah that looks good so i just going to keep the base measurements here i could apply a little bit more of variance or curl but happy with my result so i'm just going and would do the same settings for my rip change the type to fur also change it to a terry cloth i'm just going to look for my color and i also will change my base with the same settings in the next step i will fine tune my garment so i'm just will show all my pattern pieces i will also turn it to quality render so that i get already a kind of impression first of all i change this to a thicker texture surface and i'm just going to check how much it looks like i will add a little more so that it's yeah a little bit thicker for all my pieces so i'm just going to have three because it's like more heavy and what else can i do i can also put some more shrinkage on the sides by using the steam tool or elastic first of all i will go a little bit down with my particular distance so i have 20 i will work with the half now with 10 just to get already kind of like the right illusion i will simulate okay so the drape is a little bit heavier now i would like to shape my ribs and i have two ways uh how i can do it so the one is the elastic applying this on the hem or using the steam tool so usually i can really recommend to use the steam tool i will show you both sometimes the other works better than the other option so let's have it here around the hem just using the elastic so we have here the different sections in case you have it like here you want to get rid of all the segment points you can just select them right click and convert to curve points and now i can select the entire ham and then i will go to my elastic now i have like eighty percent that's quite a lot just i'm just going to do 98 and then let's see how it looks like just going to simulate and then you see it's kind of like you're getting a little bit more tight around the hip i could of course go a little bit more or what i can do as well i just will show this maybe around the neckline and that's like optional if you like to have it more like this i'm also going to do as a curve point here and now i have to look no it's not upside down so there is the ham just putting elastic here and 98 and then simulate yeah so i think that's quite nice so i will leave it okay one more thing i'm just going to take it off and we'll use the steam tool so the steam tool has the option to shrinkage things so here we have five percent of shrinkage we can adjust that on the size now we have it like that so it depends like what kind of pattern piece you have if you have a bigger pattern piece of course you can have a bigger size but if it's a small one then we can have it smaller as well as you can adjust the hardness like the inner circle as you can see here so i will keep it like that and four percent i think is fine you you can also go in the other right direction so make it like even bigger the pattern but i will keep it like four percent not as much and i'm going over the rip here i have the simulation on just to see it immediately and i just going to hold my left click and then going over you see it changed a little bit i can't just do one more time and then it's kind of like yeah shrinking i think that was the last part was a little too much so i'm just going to do one step back so just one time like that yeah i think that's better i can do the same for my repair so this is a really nice way to shape your ribs in this regard you always can remove it for instance you just right click on your steam so you can also remove your steam or just ctrl set when you want to remove the last theme you did okay so to get rid of the function i'm just going back with transform pattern a and then i'm back some other nice things we can do is for instance changing the seam property so here we have if it's like a chunky knit i can add some fold angle i will demonstrate this here as you know the fold angle is usually 180 and here you i change it to 210 just to have it yeah more like you knit i changed it to 210 just to have it a little bit more folding up if i change it to 180 sometimes it's really just really little things and you even cannot see it yeah so you can see it which is 360. it goes inwards and then when you do it the other way around so this is something you can do so 210 looks fine and this we can do for the others as well   so we don't need to do it for all the hand lines just the one which is kind of like affected i think that's fine sightseeing i did already then i'm just doing those 210 okay yeah now it's fine just simulate this quickly okay and we can also change the normal maps for the seam line as well so i'm just going to select this here and here we have our intensity from 10 i'm just going to increase the tensity of 20 just having the normal map a little bit more intense for for the seam line here at the moment you hardly can see it but later in the in the render engine we can see that the intensity is a little bit higher these are as i say really minor changes here well else we can try the thickness of five so this is this here if we would like to express that even more in this regard but in my case i actually prefer it less so it is a possibility i'm just going back to my original intensity okay now we are good to go to change the average pose so just going here changing the upper top pose and i will have the attention pose good and i will also change now the the resolution to a high resolution garment and i will apply this simulate wait a bit until it is fully simulated in this particular distance this can take up a bit of time depends on your performance of your laptop okay once we are finished that we can stop the simulation and just going to hide the avatar and i will now go to the render engine to see how it looks like just going to refresh my render engine and maybe i'm just going to double check if i might needs to change a few more things or if i'm now happy with my result to get a full preview it takes some time to see the whole product no the preview is more or less finished and i can see some wrinkles which i would like to fine-tune a little bit so for that here we have some wrinkles just in case i just want to have it a little less i can also have the simulation on then i can see it also immediately even though i have particular distance five it's okay it just will take a little bit more time but i will see it so i'm just going to keep my settings just going to open it and i'm just going to go along here and there yeah i think that's for totally fine now you see it and i'm not going to do more than that so i'm going to stop my simulation go with a transform a from my two go to my render engine simulate or have a look again but i think that definitely works fine now yeah then it's good to go to to have a nice render here i hope you enjoyed the tutorial thank you very much for watching bye ",

Introduction Welcome to this tutorial on creating a basic network flow for 3D fabric simulation. This guide will help you understand fabric selection, texture mapping, and rendering techniques to achieve realistic results. ### 2. Fabric Choice #### Selecting Fabric 1. **Open Fabric Library**: Access your fabric library within the software. 2. **Search for Knit Quality**: Type \"knit\" to filter through available knit options. 3. **Preview Fabrics**: Hover over options to see how they will drape and their physical properties. 4. **Select Fabric**: Choose a heavier knit option, such as \"Terry.\" #### Understanding Fabric Types - **Knit**: Stretchable fabric often used for garments. - **Rib**: A type of knit with a textured surface, often used in cuffs and hems. ### 3. Texture Maps #### Types of Texture Maps 1. **Color Map**: Contains color information of the fabric. 2. **Normal Map**: Creates a bump effect, enhancing surface detail. 3. **Roughness Map**: Controls the fabric's reflectivity. 4. **Displacement Map**: Physically alters the fabric's surface, creating depth. #### Creating and Applying Texture Maps - Gather the required maps before starting the application process. - Ensure that all maps are properly prepared and ready for use. ### 4. Applying Texture Maps #### Step-by-Step Map Application 1. **Select Fabric**: Click on your chosen fabric (e.g., Terry). 2. **Apply Color Map**: Drag and drop your color map onto the fabric. 3. **Apply Normal Map**: Repeat the process for the normal map. 4. **Apply Roughness Map**: Drag the roughness map onto the fabric. 5. **Apply Displacement Map**: Finally, add the displacement map. #### Scaling Maps - After applying texture maps, adjust their scales to ensure they match properly. - Use the scaling options to reduce or increase the texture size until satisfied. ### 5. Creating a Rib Texture #### Selecting and Applying Rib Quality 1. **Select Rib Fabric**: Navigate to your fabric library and choose a rib quality. 2. **Preview and Apply**: Drag the selected rib texture onto your garment. #### Adjusting Rib Textures 1. **Change Texture**: Replace the default texture with your prepared rib texture. 2. **Apply Maps**: Follow the same process to apply all required maps (color, normal, roughness, displacement). ### 6. Displacement and Fur Properties #### Understanding Displacement Maps - Displacement maps are crucial for adding depth and realism to fabrics. - Adjust the displacement amount (typically between 1-2 mm) to see the impact on your fabric. #### Fur Settings and Adjustments 1. **Select Fabric Type**: Change the fabric type to \"fur\" in the drop-down menu. 2. **Adjust Fur Properties**: - **Length**: Modify the length of the fur. - **Thickness**: Change the circumference of individual hairs. - **Density**: Adjust the number of hairs per inch. - **Segments**: Increase segments for curlier hair. ### 7. Fine-Tuning Garment Properties #### Using the Steam Tool and Elastic - **Steam Tool**: Use for shrinking fabric and adjusting hems. Set shrinkage percentage as needed. - **Elastic Tool**: Apply elastic to hems for a tighter fit. Adjust percentage for desired tightness. #### Adjusting Seam Properties 1. **Select Seamlines**: Choose relevant seamlines to adjust. 2. **Change Fold Angle**: Modify the fold angle to achieve the desired look (e.g., 210 degrees for chunkier knits). ### 8. Rendering the Final Product 1. **Hide Avatar**: Before rendering, hide the avatar to focus on the garment. 2. **Open Render Window**: Activate the render engine to preview your garment. 3. **Zoom In**: Inspect details like fur properties and fabric drape. 4. **Adjust Settings**: Fine-tune any properties as necessary. ### 9. Conclusion After following the steps outlined in this guide, you should have a well-rendered 3D fabric simulation that accurately represents your design vision. Experiment with different settings and maps to enhance the realism of your fabric. Thank you for following this tutorial! --- ### Tips and Tricks - Always preview different fabric options before making a final choice. - Adjust texture scales early in the process to avoid complications later. - Use the render engine frequently to check for realistic results. - Don’t hesitate to experiment with different fur settings to achieve the desired look. - Save your work frequently to avoid losing progress. By adhering to this guide, you should be well-equipped to create stunning fabric simulations in your 3D design projects!"

        "Transcript": "  so hi everybody um i'm natasha the marketing specialist here at khloe europe based in munich um it is my pleasure to welcome you all to our first ever academic month thank you for joining us today marks the first university presentation dedicated to our academic month with eskashir technical university based in turkey i want to introduce to you our speakers hilal seven shan and professor dr oscar chilan we'll be showing you how they have implemented khloe into their curriculum the impressive projects their students have created using khloe as well as a 15-minute q a session at the end where you'll be able to ask anything you may want to know when it comes to using khloe in the academic world hilal 7 khan is a 3d fashion designer and lecturer at estu specialized in three-dimensional clothing textile and clothing simulation using cloth 3d within the university's textile and fashion design department she works closely with our partner master key and also worked as a designer in a private design firm for two years she also dedicates her time to writing articles on fabric simulation in virtual fashion and textiles so hi missile thank you so much for joining us um i'll also introduce to you our second speaker professor dr oshkosh who is a textile engineer and has been a member of the textile and fashion design department at astu since 2017. his main research interests are related to sustainability biomaterials nanofibers and textiles as well as wearable technology so it is my absolute pleasure to introduce both of you thank you for joining us we are very excited to hear more about your program and how khloe has been of use um you can start whenever you're ready and just to keep in mind for everybody who is joining us today and this session will be recorded um for internal purposes so if you uh don't feel comfortable to to put on your camera that is totally fine but just so you know the presentation um will be recorded for internal purposes so yeah um miss hilal and professor chilan whenever you're ready um we're very very excited to to see how you've successfully implemented klo in your program thank you natasha for your nice introduction and we also would like to start thanking you and cleo team to create such a platform for us to share our experiences and also maybe more importantly to learn from the experience of other universities and we did it our in our way but probably there's a lot to learn in this process so um it's a pleasure to be also the first one and sharing the experience in this platform so we will start with the presentation now i think we can go to the next slide so our presentation is mainly in four five parts i will just quickly give a general information about our country for a little bit touristic advertising and then giving some information about university about our city and then we will share our experience with clue how we integrated it to our curriculum and how we use it in the design process and we will share some of the student designs with you how it proceeds in meantime and we will also share with you how we use it in addition to the educational purposes so we are located in turkey as mentioned before you can go to next slide uh we are in turkey turkey is a very special country is as you probably know very well we are in between two continents one of the few countries maybe one of the only countries uh have lands from both continents we are surrounded with three seas we are the bridge between east and west mix of cultures we have a great cuisine the ones who are constantly still planning their holidays for the coming summer they're more than welcome and eskyshare is located in right in the middle of the country a bit more to the west just next to ankara uh the most characteristic side of this kishir is being a student city we have in such a uh i don't say relatively small city because it's 800 000 people population it's big for a lot of countries but there's like relatively medium city in turkey we have three universities and one of them is just a technical university it's relatively new university it's uh in its name but we are we have old routes we were part of one of the university for uh more than maybe half a century we have old roots but new name we have several we can go to next slides we have several faculties including sports sciences science and architectural design architecture and design we have also institutes like institute of graduate programs earth and space transportation studies our department textile and fashion design where i'm a member is located under architecture and design faculty and there are other departments such as industrial design or interior design and architecture in our faculty and for the actually introduction of the cloud in our critical room i will give the word tree see that she will introduce that part for you thank you thanks a lot for nice comments uh or adventure of meeting a club leader as university started with with research and put comments a lot of comments and revelations are quickly heard in sophia's words in 2017 research communications uh the most important factor that claude really impressed as uh is that it collects the anti-fashion and textile process in a signal sofia the interface features and releases of the videos we watched impressed as adults in fact we have seen that is very integrated program with all education process material designs uh pattern prototype control results and show the progress of this whole process within the program average opportunities for students and as at many points and university education would be a step towards all future and or horizon um in 2017 um in 2018 we were in contact with claude reid now and we meet with a claw tree little k represent master k and we took all uh four steps and uh preparations have abandoned connections between university and claw 3d have been established and we had now uh begun to integrate the program into our university education uh we assigned with claudia the basic training within the university academic stuff and we developed all services we started the planning during the training process and the uh in the process we started to prepare the jurisdictions and present the curse proposal cures credits weekly study house and student period are an important process uh in the fourth septembers of uh 20s 2018 we integrated all kids into the third and fourth a great process and they integrated it into the program as three dimensions take science clothing simulation cloth ready and and then uh the preparation of the computer laboratory where the training will be given all the science installations and or elements we prepared with great care because because during this whole process the computer and its performance would be impressive and the course consists of one day per week and two groups and all computers are actually using uh during the training card outside the class day students lab students use lab for projects work portfolio and exercises we would you like to talk a little about our cursed can't content uh first of all uh it has been pre-appeared basis on our academic calendar and fashion design education process and claude 3 the basic training con contents uh has been determined in the general firmware as we have seen in the cursed content cloud 3d has been prepared on the basic educational content and there is a there is a training plan that starts from the introduction uh to the three dimensional textile and clothing designs and uh progress to textiles and clothing designs uh and then um three dimensions take silent garment simulation claw 3d the introduction is reflected in the curious content based uh on the content determined in the academic program we divide with uh the training process of all three dimensional safe style and clothing simulation into two parts education stage one or five weeks in the program basic training education education stage two nine weeks in the program design development project so actually in this i can just give some words the the first part of the education program is basically we are giving our students what we learned from clue team so yeah we we got some training uh our representatives got some training from the local agency let's say so we are trying to give that training to our students in the first week in the second first five weeks actually in the second part of the course we introduce learning by doing experience to to our students so they develop projects now villa didn't mention the details of it but like we try to make the program into to the course into two different layers just go ahead education stage one uh five weeks in the program in the first five weeks of the course uh we calculate the cloud lead basic training first is process training of us such as program interface learning and using tools is provided as this stage this student has completed the basic education of the program and after the visa exam uh it goes to the second stage uh second stage in the second part of the training the students are now involved with um in their own projects and designs as well as gain experience in different projects in fact this process progress in simultaneously with the education process of old school students transfer their own designs and products fabrics such as wearing lighting printing designs uh to the program simultaneously and make their clothing designs here it is part of academic training we see that claude reader is actually involved in the actual designs process and it forms and a important part of the program in this process we are seeing progress in this process these steps in fact uh the most important point we see here is that it's uh drugs or education and it is all feature oriented work um in this whole process students continue their fabric preparations decades uh pattern design and show preparations in the cloth ready and for us they are real image uh before production uh and more professional results are emerging uh they can see many revisions simultaneously without washing time uh this gives them them appropriately to evaluate and make more designs and we would like to give a short example i will just say first the what we presented here mainly is the graduate program studies we also use the two all for the postgraduate uh studies where we try to   do it to integrate it in our academic research like recently for instance we are trying to integrate a tool for using denim designs or checking the potential of using the program for maybe designing smart textiles or wearable technologies uh to this level we didn't show any examples of those we will not show today examples of those because they are really in a trial period for us now but i think in the near future we will be able to also integrate those research areas to uh program potentials and team research uh fabric selections to the skates 3d transfer pattern design and pre-design simulation we can say that is an exciting process for students much of the critical thinking about police fire skates and models and graphics of designs were created in 3d software uh this way a time showing and very effective way we created various business plans and gaining life changing experiences this process was very exciting for them the theme of all 3d collections is eclectic sunset all students who had started to work on sketch by analyzing trend researches and color patterns imploded by eclecticism she wanted to create a design by using concepts from different uh branches of art she scaled her ourselves according to her designs she prepared the patron bases and started the model application process she met to choose of fabric and material oh we constructed uh the patterns uh she created in concentrating please uh she reflected uh this in her designs with her pattern forms uh we emulated it with a short video and this it was a successful process other students work all students discussed the different uh systematization of bear patterns in the age one people and nature change and she reflected this in uh her designs uh she used sharper forms under the same team in her designs in aiming to bring together different thesis types knighted and lighter constructions have been created and then video uh we compilate all collections development process and then with a general evaluation process uh we perform the feedback process of the designs with rendering and videos and the virtual finance steps is all evaluation and revision process and time and thus students recycle project approach and revisions with clovitrol leaves and video that they upload to the stem as the textile and fashion design department we develop designs in the different fields in their anterior education process and out of school activities these are some of the student studies we have prepared in the cloth ready sofia studies have been quite great uh also in various textile products club for example man woman children uh however different fabric texture studies have been carried out design have been developed for women lighting and a non-woman surface which we discussing um within themselves now we would you like to show you with different examples uh ever adding to race designs and silk race design another example uh is knighted fabric designs full and lidar work now we see denim works we see denim washing effects effects in the tile uh this impressive yeah this is this is something to to we really would like to focus in the coming months we are in touch with an industrial partner now and they're also very curious about the potential what we can do with the tool concerning the washing effects and so on so we had performed an initial study to really preliminary tools we used so not very sophisticated yet even then we could really see that we can actually integrate those to the system library and use it with different possibilities so it's quite promising we can say yes already and in fact we see the styles uh design lines and different setups uh of the students uh a white color uh has emerged from classical designs and to avant-garde designs we can even do drafting works by p pinning them on the avatar in closerity and there are studies that excite this student um we would like to example this with address that we prepared uh with the wrapping method uh we see this leave the size this sewing and of the jacquard fabric and all beadwork and great details um as we can see in the example leather designs and accessory designs have been prepared in fact uh we use claw 3d in our accessories designs we prepare all um designs such as bag designs javelin and hats in   complementary products subject the fact that we can do all of this within the program improvise uh design development and um the students perspective on it uh the students provides uh an endless designs apparently it can create its own materials internally this is a very important that tile and after all our designs work is finished we prepare all ritual shops and color variations we illustrate this uh with short videos uh we can see in the color translations uh in detail such as red yellow blue in general we can see that the program capacitors are used in the different designs and as a university we have used cloud 3d outside of our educational activities always use it um in presentations at different parents and we had to apparently to show its own two different platforms our first steps started for educational purpose uh afterwards uh different across uh process emergence with the pandemic in parallel with the industry we came to uh four in these works with all kind of competence uh first we had to appreciate to present all digital designs at design victor k in 2019 and we and we prepared a virtual show with all students we published at the same time all first studies was very exciting uh it was really nice to witness this uh we got a good comments uh we are we are one of the field and uh important universities that provide this education in turkey we and we always get this comment um like you have integrated clothes really into your education in the most activity and best way uh this is very important to us right this moment maybe it would be wise to mention the person who actually integrated the program to the curriculum and normally he would be here instead of me one of the professors from our department mr farden actually the one who really pulled this through and integrated to the system so we want to thank him because of health issues he could not be here today but we are expecting him soon so go thank you so much and secondly uh we had uh the opportunity to attend a housing fashion week as digital designers it was the worldwide organization we have had really uh good and successful experiences here uh with a participation offer decided by all students uh we enter it uh five months uh preparations period trade nationals designers and digital designers had the ability to work together we had weekly communications and meetings um i think that's next idea we had a joint collections process with three uh three traditional designers in the works uh and we uh prepared three wheels and uh which shelves were prepared we in in this organization we had the opportunity to work um with big digital teams such as and their parties and famous designers we prepared two different fashion shows or with two different designers and the results were impressive designs uh the sustainability part everything was perfect uh which shows over broadcast um and short videos uh and we did leave broadcast with the designers we also explained it uh the process of making questions and answers uh in live broadcast and making clothes clothes design included 3d and with this organization we had opportunity to exhibit all oven collections uh collections name uh who am i uh we reflected the plans of human uh with nature and the challenge in time uh in our virtual show um we touched it on the concepts of sustainable fashion sustainable future and nature we made all designs in the catalogue we had to apprentice to publish on the richest day and with the organization we had to print to apple uh in various magazines and news uh i'd walked in we gave um an interview about sustainability fashion at virtual fashion shows and the feature process um in addition uh the apprentice of the ritual shows that we we are working and jointly have been published we took part in the digital team at digital village prepared by a hasidic fashion week we worked on the preparation of 3d garments and the virtual navigation   platform in 2020 and we recited on offer to part a participate in much less friends fashion week and this email was very exciting for us we are there with all uh own trader look designs uh collections and virtual shows uh it was great to be there under the global talent digital sustainability concept uh we created all designs collections with the limitlessness team and the videos uh we had the message we wanted uh to convey in our video uh the world of people in the world uh conceptions had increased over time uh this world where people live without limits i had become a brittle one one way out less less conceptions uh long lasting protests a little above world and then we got good uh inter interactions uh in this study and the visual show we prepared in the world magazines such as law fiscal rock bazaar and glomerul has been published we have experienced the adventures of this in all digital events and fashion weeks that we are at university and personally uh digital fashion designs in is them indispensable a part of sustainability moreover you have more options when creating stories in the digital world uh it also offers quick and easy access to digital shows during the pandemic uh this this was a huge adventure people from all over the world are just one click away from this digital world this is very impressive yes we shine all students efforts and and experiments in the social network we opened as as to 3d designs and and we create an international interactions uh all students have apparently to communicate with 3d designers from abroad try their designs and make comments um it is very vulnerable to publish our collections on such virtual platforms in the world of conceptions in fact um we see the changing plans in fashion and textile designs in the world in general designs takes a different part and the fact that we as a university are involved in these innovations creates a different perspective for about our students and us we have been preparing uh for the future uh for a long time and then in general questions is actually um on all means uh i would you like to mention uh this as well universe university white digital uh fashion education uh why cloth ready is sustainability is all uh poetry uh it is always a good idea to design uh with a zero vast stranger uh these designs and their reflections on the virtual world are just as impressive and environmentally friendly and this is why um we close we choose the digital designs education and cloud 3d program we are excited to be a part of this organization yeah since 2017 thanks to the person uh which gave a presentation and the one who's on the slide uh it's not a long time ago but i think the pros progress we had in this context is quite big to our feeling and the more we get into it the more we see that there's a big potential so uh that's why we are looking forward to listening to other universities who will participate in the coming weeks and learn and get inspired mainly from their experiences so thank you all for listening us and we will be more than happy to answer your questions thanks thanks so much so thank you thank you so much for such an insightful presentation it's so impressive how you've you've so successfully implemented khloe into the program and and these exciting projects that that the students are have been able to create and be a part of um using khloe um i'm sure a lot of you have um a lot of questions you would like to ask um and we will try to get to all of you um so whoever would like to answer a question you can simply press the button on the bottom of the zoom screen if you click on reactions and click on raise hand once you have your hand raised uh we will request to unmute you and uh you can ask ms hilal or professor jaylan whatever questions you may have when it comes to how they have implemented khloe and and their experiences with khloe in the academic world um so we see here i'm gonna ask to unmute you we have one first question okay you should be able to to speak now yeah good evening or graphene i do not know which part of the time it is okay and so we thank you for a great insight that you have demonstrated as part of the university and academy how this close 3d is being implemented uh i have a question uh do we have a facility to customize the avatar to different body size proportions is that any features available in growth 3d mostly we try to drape in the inbuilt avatar that has been available as part of the library given in the code 3d software my question is do we customize the avada's shape to different body proportions is there any such uh facility available in poetry did you follow villain i made clear yeah did the crucial part i missed but i think you're asking just i will rephrase it you're asking if it's possible to create avatars yeah or customize avatars in your with the predefined uh i think we can do that yes we can do it and we're doing it like based on actually one of my students projects will be about that in the coming in the coming months actually that we're we will try to create some specific body types uh on on on the tool itself some specific avatars and we will try to compare those maybe i'm giving some secret information but we will try to compare those with the general size sets and try to compare it or try to see whether this classic size sets are still fitting to the specific body types or not so this is one of the research topics we will study one of my students in the coming future so it is possible in short thank you thank you so much thank you so much for starting this sort of information okay well thank you so so much for for your questions um and yeah i see we have some other questions in the chat as well um so we have hi greetings from nift delhi india could you share the challenges and roadblocks you face while incorporating clothes 3d in your course curriculum actually we didn't live much uh it was an integrated program in other programs and pattern programs uh illustrator for photoshop integration and actually we didn't play much the what we have in in our curriculum is and we're actually building up in these digital programs like this is the softwares we start from the first you know second year i think teaching students starting with photoshop and then going with two illustrator and then it goes to different pattern tools and then we added this as a third year students so they have some sort of background in digital technologies so and the tool itself glo has integration possibilities with those tools so which is also a great help and then if you if you can build up this uh in the curriculum somehow then it would be easier it is easier to integrate it so we actually as hell says didn't face much resistance to it so we have we have another question from hina so how can the translation may be smooth and seamless between 2d to 3d software so um that's the biggest challenge that that they are facing uh i i integrated a 3d and 2d view and import pattern and simultaneously um receive flow 3d pattern and change no yeah face some okay thank you so much and then um we also have a question from elena um asking in what year of study um are these um do students study the program with khloe can i can i hear it again sorry yes of course so elena is asking in what year of study do students study the program khloe they start in the third year okay so third we actually we actually started in the beginning of the when we first implemented in the program uh it was in the third year and fourth year at the same time because we we didn't want to miss uh we didn't want students to miss this opportunity so the fourth year students we gave the course both to four and third years at the same time so the graduates could get it get this opportunity as well and it was really nice it helped them through also to getting new job opportunities actually so now i think it's integrated to the third issue nice um then we have another question from baby are there any digital courses available for international students specifically for digital fashion for from our sites unfortunately not but it's a very nice idea actually we can we can consider that nice if maybe cleo provides a platform for that we would be more than happy to exchange exchange our experience in that way yeah it would be a great idea um yeah and then we have a question from jane um super interesting thank you may i ask if you're using other software other than uh khloe for 3d uh yes for 3d simulation no just correct me if i'm mistaken no for three no no no okay no for the moment no nice and then we have here another question from hina thank you um what are the new career opportunities um your students are taking up after learning claw so yeah that's actually a good example of it is just sitting in front of us like hillary's one of our graduates and she did her master also with us the professor that we mentioned and she started to work as a 3d designer in a company i mean she can explain her career as well but now she recently jumped to the to the local distributor of the tool she's working with them now so it's a really good example but i also have a person i have one student who when who has been hired because she could use glo in a denim factory like in a denim design company so yeah it's a it provides great opportunities i can assure you like knowing this 3d simulation in this era is like becoming a need i can tell you yeah for sure for sure um especially with the with the future of the industry and and and the the type of designers and and um people who are being looked for in the moment it's it's so important um yes so yeah yeah indeed but also like uh we learned a lot during the pandemy uh yeah like we we showed some examples if maybe pandemonium would not be there we would not be able to use uh or we would not be able to participate if glow wouldn't be there we would be just outside of the whole fashion shows fashion weeks you know all the organizations we would be an outsider we could still participate thanks to the uh to thank the skills that we had in that context and the more they really look at it now with this after pandemic especially there's like a great great road to go with this and uh like with with the integration of social media and all yeah there's unlimited really like limitless opportunities yeah that's really great um then uh yeah i'll go on to the next question thank you so much um is asking um if you will start animation in your course like cinema 4d or blender in the future as well um well we don't not give training now and then maybe in the future yeah we don't give training now right yeah we might this is like what we said actually our journey is quite short i mean like it's four years in total so from the moment we touched to this and now so uh there's a lot to go really there's a lot to go we there's a lot to learn investigate explore and be really looking forward for that great yeah it's so impressive when you say you know only four years and and you know everything you've accomplished and seeing these student projects it's it's really mind-blowing um what you've been able to achieve so yeah really really amazed so i will um go to the next question um what was the role of claw so i guess in this case master key as software provider in facilitating you with the curriculum was there any handholding we were getting support uh with master k as first education also a lot of trainings i think i personally got one so yes you had the academic basic training correct you mentioned in the presentation yeah great okay then i think that we've covered all the questions um so at this point um i want to thank you all for joining us today um we hope that you were able to gain valuable insights and just how valuable khloe can be within academic institutions it's really truly our hope that students are able to learn the technologies such as khloe that will be vital for their success in the future of the industry so in order to continue the conversation we would like to ask anyone who is interested in sharing their contact information to type share in the chat and we will create a list of emails and share these with the participants of the session this way you can stay connected if you wish to do so and discuss any topics related to khloe in academics and at this point really i want to thank you so so much miss hilal and professor jalen it was really such an amazing presentation and really looking forward just to see how how uh khloe will develop even further in your program um as it's already so impressive what what you've been able to do in the in the past four years um yeah and and to everyone again uh thank you for joining and um don't forget to register uh for our next university presentation taking place next week so um have a great day thank you so much bye bye bye bye thank you thank you ",
        "Summary": "# Comprehensive Guide on Implementing CLO 3D in Academic Curriculum ## Introduction This guide summarizes the implementation of CLO 3D software in the curriculum at Eskisehir Technical University (ESTU) in Turkey, as presented by Hilal Seven Khan and Professor Dr. Oscar Chilan during an academic event. CLO 3D is a powerful tool for 3D fashion design, simulation, and visualization, which has become increasingly important in the fashion industry. **Key Highlights:** - Introduction to CLO 3D and its benefits in fashion education. - Steps for integrating CLO 3D into the university's curriculum. - Examples of student projects and outcomes. - A Q&A session addressing common questions about CLO 3D. ## Step-by-Step Integration Process ### Step 1: Research and Initial Contact - **Background Research**: Familiarize yourself with CLO 3D's capabilities and its relevance in fashion and textile design. - **Initial Contact**: Reach out to CLO 3D representatives for information and potential partnerships. ### Step 2: Training and Preparation - **Training for Faculty**: Arrange for basic training sessions for faculty members to understand the software's functionalities. This may involve on-site training or online workshops. - **Curriculum Development**: Work with faculty to design a course outline that incorporates CLO 3D into the existing fashion design curriculum. ### Step 3: Curriculum Implementation - **Course Structure**: - **Duration**: Implement the CLO 3D course over two stages: - **Stage 1 (5 Weeks)**: Introduction to CLO 3D, including interface navigation and tool usage. - **Stage 2 (9 Weeks)**: Design development projects where students apply their knowledge in practical assignments. - **Hands-on Experience**: Ensure students have access to computers equipped with CLO 3D, allowing them to practice and develop their projects. ### Step 4: Student Projects and Evaluation - **Project Assignments**: Assign projects that require students to create their own designs using CLO 3D. Encourage creativity and application of theoretical knowledge. - **Feedback and Revision**: Implement a feedback mechanism where students can showcase their work, receive critiques, and make revisions using the software. ### Step 5: Showcase and Industry Integration - **Virtual Fashion Shows**: Plan events where students can present their designs digitally, showcasing their work to a broader audience, including industry professionals. - **Collaborations with Industry**: Engage with local fashion industries to provide students with real-world experience and potential job placements. ## Definitions - **CLO 3D**: A 3D garment visualization tool that allows designers to create, simulate, and visualize garments in a digital environment. - **Textile and Fashion Design**: A field of study that combines art, design, and technology to create textiles and apparel. - **Sustainability in Fashion**: Designing clothing with a minimal environmental footprint, often incorporating recycled materials and ethical production practices. ## Tips and Tricks - **Start Small**: Begin with a short course on CLO 3D before expanding it into a full-fledged program. - **Encourage Collaboration**: Promote teamwork among students to enhance learning and creativity. - **Utilize Online Resources**: Encourage students to use CLO's online tutorials and community forums to enhance their understanding of the software. - **Feedback Loops**: Establish regular feedback sessions to help students refine their designs and improve their skills. - **Stay Updated**: Fashion technology evolves rapidly; keep abreast of updates in CLO 3D and incorporate new features into the curriculum. ## Conclusion The successful integration of CLO 3D into the curriculum at Eskisehir Technical University showcases the importance of adopting modern technologies in fashion education. By following the outlined steps, other academic institutions can similarly enhance their programs, preparing students for the demands of the evolving fashion industry. This guide serves as a foundational resource for educators and institutions aiming to implement CLO 3D in their curriculum effectively."

        "Transcript": "  hello everyone i am itacion welcome and thank you for joining us i'm a senior patron making structure at this tomorrow milano previously i taught fashion design and garment construction at new york fashion institute of technology for technical di milano and other prestigious universities for the last three years i have been a part of the marangoni family the milan campus we are a small team of club 3d teachers erisa ibrahimi loredana pizzata stefano peloso and myself we teach cloth ready rba women's spheres menswears accessory design and my fashion design courses in italy the bachelor of art in fashion design is three years we teach club in all three years together with program leaders i designed the cloud for the scheme of work for second third year and master classes then we implemented cloud pretty in our curricula before the pandemic we strongly believe in innovation and technology why we implemented cloud 3d the answer is very simple marangoni always was and continued to be a pioneer in innovation therefore it was a truly natural process for us to implement cloth ready in our courses how the answer to this question we will find in following slides actually we faced several challenges when we started each club ready most of them are related to the pandemic we had already started teaching club 3d to our second year ba students and to our ma students then when the pandemic happened we decided to teach cloth 3d also to our third year students before the pandemic we designed our courses with the idea that the students should use the campus computers when the pandemic happened we find ourselves in a completely different position we find that our students computer are not optimum to run cloth ready especially because their graphic cards did not support backlot ready or recording of the animation work through the slope on their devices as a solution we decided to buy servers and to create virtual machines to offer to our students and as you know cloud does not recommend virtual machines therefore rit team literally invented solution to allow us to use virtual machines another problem is more related to the cloud 3d clause suggests to use three button pointing device but our students are used to trackpad so believe me it was super super hard to pursue the student to start to use a mouse and leave to use the trackpad anyhow the biggest challenge that we had was update our teaching method when we were teaching cloud 3d in our campus students could follow the teachers seeking from projectors but when we started to teach in blended mode or when we were at home it was hard for students to follow closing zoom and to practice in the main time one solution could have been to use two devices for example ipad to follow the class and computer to practice but we were looking for a more efficient solution which could work for everyone therefore i proposed an alternative teaching method to divide our courses into theory and practice days i created club trade video tutorials for theory classes ontario class days i would share these tutorials with the students in this way they could watch them anytime they visit and in practice day i will check their works help them to solve their problems or improve their projects now in my second year of teaching club 3d i have an enormous library of tutorials and i realized how important it is for students to have these short videos every teacher has his her methods today beside pandemic after two years of cloth ready teaching experience i strongly believe in tutorials they become a key part of my teaching model i organize them in a drive folder which i share with my students i would like to show you these drive folders because i think it will give a concrete idea of how my courses are structured at maragon as you can see there are four main eye areas cloth with the assets fabric for clad ready it's basically a fabric library we have a pattern library and video tutorials in cloud 3d assets students will find claw assets compatible with our avatar's motion and poses the fabric folder is divided in several sections one of them fabric with maps where they can find several 3d manipulation with displacement map normal map roughness map we have also several other folders with just textures and from the day that claw release 6.1 we were able to also create our customized fabric and export them so now also students can find our fabrics that made by teachers our pattern library is divided into two sections menswear and women's spheres here you can see what includes the women's verse section we have different trousers kimono raglan dress different bodice type basically all the patterns that normally the students can find on the fashion lab in the campus they can find also in this folder as a cloth 3d project file plus of course there are additional patterns that i created in these years based on students requests and needs so we enrich our virtual library the same folder like moments where we have also for men's sphere and finally our video tutorials folder which is available in two languages because in marangon if we deliver courses in italian and english so in this way both languages have the same content we have here three main area basic tools advanced tools and pattern making in the advanced tool this is what my students find when they click on the advanced tool for example padded jacket for me is an advanced skill because a padded garment could include beside padding also top stitching packering changing the stitching tension maybe you have to play with the shrinkage value to give more realistic look for the garment so here what is included the padded jacket folder as you can see there are eight videos plus the zipper texture and zipper fabric so students if interested the whole process can follow in order or he or she just interested in one part of it sorry for this she or he is just interested on one part can just follow the part that is looking for this is the new result in case they correct the follow-up tutorials here we have the last section one dedicated to the pattern making and alteration as you can see also this part is divided into several folders here you can see what the color folder include how several color types but also for very basic extremely basic ideas like neckline adjustment overlapping value fusible fabric we have short videos so if by chance that does not remember a specific topic can find the can easily find what looking for so of dismay we also started to teach cloud 3d to our first year student as well we starting teaching claw with basic tools and how to use them for pattern alteration in second year we teach advanced tools and we create real digital prototypes in third year we are more focused on students on collection and helping students to develop their outfits in cloud 3d since claw always really is a new version normally every term we start what is new class so we teach new comments to students and after that on the third year instead of having cherry classes i have just one-to-one review days with the students i explain to them how to make their own creation and if there are any tutorials that fits their needs i suggest them which tutorials to follow once digital prototyping is done they print out the patterns and do fabric prototype and we have fitting days during which i check the physical prototype and if it is necessary with the alterations in digital and in real prototype then this is done finally we can create render and animations and students continue to realize the outfit in final fabrics here we have some examples peter varga he is studying manchester's at the third year in marangon university degree you have his technical drawing and illustration here we have his prototype and plus physical prototype they are first prototypes so first pictures here we have eliza utley she is studying women's squares on third year again her illustration technical drawing and club prototype here you can have a better look of glow prototype as you can see beside the classical shapes we try to experiment with new volumes and with new shapes elisa successfully realized this new volumes also in the real fabric as you can see the resemblance is very high in her illustration between clutter the prototype and the final physical prototype so we are super happy with the result nithya sasidharan she is also studying on third year she created this garment after six weeks of claw learning experience and after eight weeks on total she already make the real garment so of course the clutter the type to be improved when you have a student that after six week achieve this result as a teacher i was very very satisfied and just after two weeks already physical prototype was ready so also since everything done in eight weeks the quality of the picture is a little bit under our quality level but just just to make you understand how quickly our students achieve very high results i would like to turn back to our teaching method and i would like to share with you a small video here you can see how we also use cloth 3d to experiment with new volumes here you can see a video where i suggest to my student to use shrinkage value to experiment with new shapes and volumes once students are done with experimenting they discuss with the design teacher which shape could work better and we start to create that volume in the correct construction method in the next slide we have example giovanni porta he is again starting on the third year so this is the one that we used correct construction method but basically before to make the real pattern we use this shrinkage value experimenting for us the quality insurance is very very important and we want to be sure that students prototypes could be close as possible to the dear illustrations therefore i ask them to create a rectangle in 3d where to apply as a graphic their illustration and technical drawing in this way from the very beginning to the very end we can always compare what we are doing here you have an example that i created for my students so on the left in the 3d work area you see my 3d prototype on the right in the tool the work area you have prada's original photos this is how does look our work areas with this giant rectangle always we deactivate this rectangle in the 3d area to have faster to use faster maintenance software and here you can have you can compare micro 3d prototype with the original picture we use this kind of project to also encourage students because we realize that when students see that the final level of the quality and the final result is very high they are more welcome to learn the software because they know they can achieve they already know that they can do literally almost real prototypes include so that's give them more love and desire to know how to use the software here you can see juliana baldi's work she is also studying third year in marangoni she is in the menswear courses here you have her illustration technical drawing and her prototype you can see here her huge rectangle all the patterns here you can compare illustration technical drawing and digital prototype on the top you can see layout from cloth ready and on the bottom part we have from our fitting days where we check the garments and we actually do fit things so the fixtures are unfortunately again under our quality level but are useful to give you the concrete idea of the whole process is studying women's sphere again on third year this is a kind of the presentation that we asked the students so from this page you can see the presentation prepared by leila so her outfit with the public chart and some inspiration image for the manipulation her illustration technical drawings and hardware color charts again a drawing for the manipulation we have here 2d patterns exported from cloth ready here you can have digital prototype and this is the prototype in muslin fabric unfortunately still not ready the final fabric one so that's why i cannot share with you here carlotta brancacho again she's studying third gear at the system marangoni we have her illustration technical drawing and claw prototype here you can see the patterns and her muslin fabric type while she again she is from third year you can see here her first prototype with a cheaper fabric because it's not muslin it's a gainable but you know a little more other than less expensive than the real one here we have the digital prototype and here on the hanger you can compare technical drawing garment we also teach accessory design cloth ready these projects are followed by elisa ibrahim so from this slide on teacher that follow the project is elizabeth me luigi karada this bag from third gear in accessory design here tyron delgado make glove using fur and knitted fabric here we have some bags from anita by first one of white for the brand and here have she present her project with head also at the end of the turn here in master courses lauren garner she has here some expressional image her illustration and cloth ready prototype here you have some more examples from her book and this is my last study case miriban berton she is one of the iron master students here i was amazed by the quality of her work especially in details and the fabric the use of the particle distance so i want to add my presentation her garments and here you can see on the fingers i hope it was not too fast i have this bad habits to talk very very fast and i am at the end of my question i hope it was clear and i hope you enjoy it yes it was a really great presentation thank you so much um for this inside uh full presentation you did just now it is really great to see how you have been able to be able to really teach the students using the tutorials and they be successfully also using it for their personal um presentations um and their personal projects let's say i'm sure now that all of you have questions um for me john and if you like to raise your questions please feel free to raise your virtual hands using the labeled reaction button or directly typing it into the chat and i will try to get to all of these questions and um yeah read them out loud in order to for meet her john to answer them so let's see what we have um there is one question about textures i think it's really more about your experience with textures have you ever tried to work with two textures and how they can be look more realistic basically if you work with the tool i understand why andrews make this question because the tool looks like it's very stable in the claw on the first stage but they are physical property of the fabric so to give more realistic look we open silk knitted jersey fabric and we apply tool texture on the top of it in this way it's smoother based on my experience tool knitted fabric is the one of that fall down more smooth again you can open the physical properties of the fabric and a little bit go down with values of background i think the name banking because i let me copy from my computer how is the name of the line just i need one second yeah bending bending vest bending grab and bending bias there are three on the line so that i see the name i remember but now i miss it sorry because sometimes my english between me so you can make a lower bending values to give more similar look to your fabric so that's how we solve our tool issue cool great and there's a few more questions related to really um teaching but first of all there's someone who'd like to know and how long you've been using chloe and what training did you do to be able to teach the students then ah basically i started to use clothes ready in 2018 and i didn't have any training before i explained to natasha and natalie at the beginning of the art meeting that i learned clothes ready for a very very personal use yeah and i can tell the reason yeah if you like to i think it's a really great reason in 2019 i get married and the year before i start to make research for the garment and actually my spouse is very very needy and make his groom dress was a big experience for me and then i decide if i have to do cowlick and muslim fabric sample that we're going to take forever to make him happy and i heard about that marvelous design has a spin of clothes ready that you can make virtual prototype it's very easy to use this and that and say okay let me discover how much easy to use and i downloaded there was a 30 days of free trial and then i forgot about this event and i never used and it expired my 30 days to advice and i wrote on the claw by explaining them it's expired and i couldn't use and they extended my trial use in order that i can use it i was super super happy and i make my husband groom karma in the club and then a he loved it the idea and my mother-in-law love it my mother was jealous and then i started to make also their garments in the clutter and in this way i get my first touch with the claw and when marangoni organized courses for our teachers include treaty i said okay i know i have to use it so i don't have to attend the course so and then they discovered that i already know it so it was a very very personal reason but as you know chloe release every six months almost a new version but they make webinar this webinar are available in multiple languages and they are always available in youtube so sometimes on sunday i bring my computer and i watch 6.1 what is new 6.0 what is sometimes from their webinar also when they release a new version there's a huge list of what is new believe me line by line i go to the read what is new what they added what is coming soon because i learn more when i read and not when somebody explained me i am almost 40 years old on my time we were studying from the books so i have again this attitude but i figure out that my student has a from a new generation they learn from tutorials they learn from videos so i created totally new environment to me for them to make them easy to use since somehow i copy cloud because when you use claw on the top in every tool you have short videos about how to use coulombs but sometimes they are just applied on a rectangle but not on the sleeve not on the collar so it's easier to understand when it's applied on a physical garment rather than geometrical shape so i just stole their idea and added my government construction skills and create these drives but it's really great to understand that you really involved to this level of teaching others by really um trying to get to this new way of teaching yourself also by using tutorials and so on and it's really great to see that um and then another question would actually be how many hours are you teaching then close to the students each year you will not gonna believe but a lot a lot i mean because it looks like that we are four teachers but lorettana started to teach from the may and ariza actually works for prismatics in italy so she can just work few hours and stefano he is in marangoni friendship campus florence campus so he can just do some hours so all the rest i do i can assure you from monday to friday from 8 30 to the 8 30 i have four classes all five days so i teach 40 hours clock per week so that's what i tell natalie and natasha i learned a lot from my student mistakes from their questions to be able to answer them you know to also inspire them to give them a solid idea of the teacher that has behind their shoulders i was keep trying to learn even more even more so because it's very sad to say just so that i don't know or i cannot help you so sometimes i was telling this is very advanced let me explain something else the next week we will see how to do this and i was going to discover on internet how to do that in order to be able to do that the next week because i have around 300 students so from the 300 students they can come several different questions that you never expect one of this was the other days a student by his self he discovered how he can apply hdri image to the dome light in the cloud to the render but when you put the ground shadow claw cut out the half of the image because under the ground shadow you cannot see the pictures from the dome light and he was helping for he was hoping for my help i was okay send me your file i will try to do my best so literally i just learned from also their questions and it's a very nice experience and journey for me perfect that's great and do you think like um for the students do they have um pattern making knowledge before they start um in your program yeah it's helpful yeah basically but what we did at the beginning because we started from the second year that on the second year that the students apply properly or does not apply properly pattern making we didn't give that much importance it was more important how does it look on the avatar on the third year we give more importance if the pattern making is correctly applied because at the first touch learn all the clothes and correctly apply pattern making we still use marangoni's pattern construction method from the historical i mean from our history so they are from 20 years that we are using the same methods and we are super meticulous on how we apply that millimetrically i think also that's make difference after marangoni we can't wait from a student that on his first child touch the clock to apply hold the marangoni pattern construction to the club so first two years we just check like this the pattern and on third year we give more importance to the fitting because they have to print out cut and sew okay i see and um do they sometimes use the pattern draft the patterns directly in in khloe or do they import it also from other third-party software in their projects sometimes no basically we have the patterns library they can open outright change them or sometimes i show them maybe on pinterest or another book they find some interesting pattern that they can import as a graphic including a square and then with a trace tool like polygon tool they can trace it and once that they have a clear idea of the shoulder dimension or waist dimension they can scale and in somehow digitalize the pattern sometimes they find easily to use illustrator for tracing part instead of club but some others prefer immediately from the club because they know that at least it will work that important part of the except they will not gonna have issue later so most of you use claw okay so they really have freedom to start wherever they like and then okay beautiful we have a raised hand here i'm going to unmute um the participant um serene yes hello actually some of my doubts were answered during the in the waiting uh i'm on a marangoni alumni myself i went there like uh 2008 or seven i can't remember now um and now i'm a teacher in spain so i was i teach pattern making actually and i was trying to to implement cloud 3d on the school so i wanted to to learn how all the people is doing it it's super super interesting i really love uh the method and i think it's great for people who still doesn't know how to pattern make themselves it's it's it's really great i was wondering um how how long do you need before a student can be um like um work on his own how how long do you need to work with students before they can work on their own i can tell you of course it depends from the student's quality you know i mean the students desire to learn claw but we have for example in master courses street term each term eight week first eighth week our aim teach almost everything about clone it's challenging so maybe not 100 percent but 70 percent 80 percent we try to teach in eight weeks because in the second term they have eight weeks to create two outfits in claw trinity maybe each of them are three pieces and on the third term they have to do render animation and in case to do the real fabric the garment so in 24 weeks they have to learn software make two outfits make animation make render and realize the real garments in case of some of my students that i'm super proud of them because they came from marangoni and mumbai and in marangoni mumbai we don't teach club trading in the second year so they just arrived on the third year like nitya and in basically eight weeks she learned how to use colo she did this i mean i can share again my second and go to the presentation quickly okay i was gone just i need one more second you have that second for sure thank you so basically nitia achieved this result after five weeks from her first touch with cloth ready it is not normal what normally happens but after eight weeks there was also the final garment that's the reason how many hours did they do per week like that two hours and a half per week that's it okay and she basically since on the third year we do one by one she has 10 minutes to discuss with me okay after 50 minutes of discussion he arrived on that result after 15 minutes of discussion with the teacher 10 minutes every week that's why i am telling tutorial makes a lot because she know that she has to learn top stitching she got top stitching she not have to learn packing she got packing she needs to make sleeve enlargement she go to the sleeve enlargement folder of course when i receive their file i tell them every single tutorial that they can use to achieve that result plus all the missing part because total cannot have all the information for everyone so it's more also students success rather than my success so i think okay also for the michigan the last one that i saw in the presentation this is what she did after 12 weeks so the last one on the presentation i would like to escape but okay in this way i can do fastly to achieve this result after 12 weeks so and for me to see that realistic jersey also did not hear i was literally amazed also the elastic line the piping it's all about students has inspiration i think in the clutter the the biggest role of the teacher is not teaching them glo but to inspire them to learn claw to show them what club can do to make them love clothes for example in my first courses before they teach everything i just teach them how to change color how to personalize their avatar how to use the layers and i give them several outfits so they can apply texture that i want they can apply the color they can customize their avatar and they can also make a quick animation so they have a wonderful job done in two hours ready to share on their instagram ready to share on their linkedin so once that they start to share this information on their social media and they receive feedbacks from the parents from the family from the other colleagues they get excited about the software and they have a reason to learn that software because they are not on that level that they achieve they show because they just receive outfit already done by teacher they just take color look play with the texture so they see that if they arrive on that level there's a huge a satisfaction in terms of personal achievement and they say okay i want to learn the software and they start to learn it's it's very stimulating yeah it bumps you it's great personal motivation a lot i believe and what we i think also learned in terms of you as a teacher motivating them you use a lot of tutorials and as a tool to really get them to their individual levels as well and there is this question of how you you're building up these tutorials are you using other software to do so how are you prepping these basically i have a very simple software to cut to the videos you know because as today sometimes i miss some words in english or even italian because i am half turkish of spanish and it's hard for me to make tutorials in both languages that are not my mother tongue so i have to stop so many times so i have just a software to put them together the short parts of the video to edit them and that's it and literally i don't i did just in one languages in english the one that i speak it my italian level is much much better than my english level so i do in the level that is harder for me to do then i literally cancel the voice from editing video in english and i make italian since i have more higher level in italian it's easier for me to make short sentences or make longer sentences so fill the gaps and i can better play with the languages to make that it's work that students cannot understand my mysteries are that intelligent that they say they don't hear the click of the mouse that when the tutorial is on the original language they can't click hear the click of the button of the mouse they say this is originally made in english this is originally italian and i amaze how much attention they pay because they say sometimes we have to count how many times you click to understand where you click what you did that's great because that also tells us that they are very serious about their um learning teaching skills and so on i think we are a little bit running out of time because you're giving us so much insightful additional details here in your answers maybe one more question and there's a few questions in one um one chat it's about uh rendering and animation so how do you do it with animations and longer videos do you have an in-house gaming computer can the students learn it from and render using the laptops what has been the hardware process in marangoni basically since the animation calculation is very long on our students computer and if you have to make render animation it's become truly hard for them we have these servers around 65 servers and students can achieve 24 hours seven days on these servers and use from any part of the earth our school computers that we have highly recommended close settings you know they are specific computer requirements from the globe we have that highly recommended package on this server and we use them i have a gaming computer for myself so i use a gaming computer for that and i think i answered the question yes that's perfect okay there is even one more question i also would love to hear the answer to um so let's we're already a little bit over time but let's maybe have this really one last question and how long do you do the handbag students study khloe are there a classic specific to this area can you share a little bit or is that because we are learned that this is not your main part but maybe you already have also have insights for that i didn't understand that question actually and how long do the handbag students study clo are there classic specific handbag what's mints the bags handbags yes i don't know the meaning of the handbag okay that is more a recess point so your co-workers um focus right literally i don't know the meaning of the handbag so i cannot understand the question uh a bag um a accessory a handbag okay i got it now i never take the handbag i was looking for a more you know concept than writer the product i literally i never teach accessory design that's erisa's area so i have two tutorials for handbag because i take in five points to color release this 3d shape that you can literally click on the top and achieve the pattern and play on that so i make these two backs to give the students an idea but i really prefer to don't express myself because i don't want to give any wrong information okay i understand thank you still um i think we're just gonna take this topic of bad creation and teaching back creation also for maybe a next academic month and then we can have maybe more insights also on that next time so yes again i think we're running out of time and i really like to thank you and so much for this inside presentation and really sharing all the details also in the answers to all the questions we had and we hope that all of the participants were able to gain also this valuable insights and um to to have are inspired really using them also in their academic institutions and see what's possible in order to continue to continue the conversation we really like to ask everyone who is interested to sharing their contact information to type share again into the chat as we did last time for the ones who already attended we will create a list in the next couple of days and weeks that we're gonna share so that you can keep in contact and you maybe can also ask directly meet her john about more more questions and so thank you again for joining us and a huge thank you to you miha john it was really a pleasure to to um join you in this meeting today and yes and there is going to be one more session in this academic month so please register in case you haven't and we're going to see you then next week again you ",
        "Summary": "## Comprehensive Guide to Teaching Fashion Design with CLO 3D This guide provides a detailed breakdown of the methods and processes mentioned in the transcript of a presentation by Miha John, a senior instructor at Marangoni in Milan, regarding the integration of CLO 3D software into fashion design education. ### Table of Contents 1. **Introduction** - Overview of CLO 3D - Importance of Technology in Fashion Design 2. **Course Structure** - Curriculum Breakdown - Teaching Methodology 3. **Implementation of CLO 3D** - Challenges Faced - Solutions Developed 4. **Tutorial Creation** - Importance of Tutorials - Organization of Tutorials 5. **Student Learning Journey** - Learning Phases - Examples of Student Work 6. **Rendering and Animation** - Hardware Requirements - Process Overview 7. **FAQs and Tips** - Common Questions - Best Practices for Teaching with CLO 3D --- ### 1. Introduction **Overview of CLO 3D** - CLO 3D is a powerful software used for fashion design, allowing designers to create digital prototypes of garments. - It enables visualization of designs in 3D, making it easier to assess fit, fabric behavior, and overall aesthetic. **Importance of Technology in Fashion Design** - Technology enhances creativity, reduces the time needed for prototyping, and allows for a more sustainable approach to fashion by minimizing fabric waste. ### 2. Course Structure **Curriculum Breakdown** - The Bachelor of Arts in Fashion Design spans three years. - Courses include: - Women's and men's wear - Accessory design - Fashion design theory and practice **Teaching Methodology** - Classes are divided into theory days (lectures, tutorials) and practice days (hands-on application). - Students are encouraged to learn through individual exploration and guided practice. ### 3. Implementation of CLO 3D **Challenges Faced** - During the pandemic, the shift to online learning revealed issues with students’ hardware compatibility. - Students were accustomed to trackpads and needed to transition to using a mouse. **Solutions Developed** - The school invested in servers and created virtual machines to support software use. - Tutorial videos were created to facilitate learning, allowing students to access resources any time. ### 4. Tutorial Creation **Importance of Tutorials** - Tutorials serve as a critical resource for students, enabling them to learn at their own pace. - Having a library of tutorials helps reinforce learning and provides visual aids for complex concepts. **Organization of Tutorials** - Tutorials are organized into folders based on topics such as: - Basic tools - Advanced tools - Pattern making - Content is available in multiple languages (Italian and English) to cater to diverse student backgrounds. ### 5. Student Learning Journey **Learning Phases** - First Year: Introduction to basic tools and pattern alterations. - Second Year: Advanced tools and creation of digital prototypes. - Third Year: Focus on collection development and finalizing outfits. **Examples of Student Work** - Students rapidly achieve high-quality results, often completing garments within weeks of starting the software. - Projects are assessed on both digital prototypes and physical samples. ### 6. Rendering and Animation **Hardware Requirements** - CLO 3D requires powerful hardware for rendering and animation; ideally, schools should provide access to high-performance computers. - Marangoni utilizes servers to allow students to render projects remotely. **Process Overview** - Students create digital prototypes, which can then be rendered and animated. - The use of rendering software allows for high-quality visual presentations of designs. ### 7. FAQs and Tips **Common Questions** - **How long does it take for students to become proficient in CLO 3D?** - Typically, students can achieve a level of proficiency within 8-12 weeks of dedicated practice. - **Do students need prior pattern-making knowledge?** - While helpful, it is not mandatory. Basic skills are taught alongside the software. **Best Practices for Teaching with CLO 3D** - Encourage students to share their work on social media for motivation and feedback. - Use a mix of visual, auditory, and kinesthetic teaching methods to cater to different learning styles. - Regularly update tutorials and teaching materials to reflect the latest software updates and trends in fashion design. ### Conclusion Integrating CLO 3D into fashion design education at institutions like Marangoni promotes innovation and prepares students for a rapidly evolving industry. By leveraging technology, creating valuable resources, and fostering a supportive learning environment, educators can enhance the educational experience and help students achieve their creative visions."

        "Transcript": "  hi to everyone um for today's session i'm natalie i'm a business development manager here at clare europe i'm based out of munich and it is my pleasure to welcome you to our last session for the first ever academic month thank you for joining us today and today marks the fourth again last session for our presentation and uh we're gonna have um albstadt sigmaringen university joining us today and i'm i'm very happy to be able to introduce to you um our speaker professor dr christian kaiser who will be presenting to you how khloe was implemented in the university and how to really uh improve the usage of clothes throughout each semester um and how it's really used in the industry later on in industry projects and so on and there will be also a 15-minute q a session at the end where you are able to ask anything you may want to know um when it comes to khloe in the academic world and please be aware that this session will be recorded so in case you would like to switch off your camera during the session please feel free to do so and i'll ask you to also keep yourself muted again throughout the whole presentation so that we don't have any background noises um here are clearing um so yeah professor dr christine kaiser teaches textile and clothing technology at the albert sigma lingan university in germany having studied technical cybernetics his research research lies in digital process chains simulation based assessment of garment fit and virtual sampling with this expertise he continues to develop this area of teaching and provides his students with the latest technologies such as khloe in albstadt signaling and university it is my pleasure to introduce you to and to have you joining us today um we are very excited to hear hear more about your program and how khloe has been of use um in your university and you can start whenever you are ready thank you i am great let's jump in it so that's also my pleasure to welcome all of you um to to me it's a real honor um to have the chance to speak out about what we are doing at our university and um how we introduced um 3d um in our teaching perhaps some words to say in the front i'm personally super convinced of the necessity and the importance of 3d reason for that might be actually not from textile industries basically but i'm more systems and control engineers so i was really taught to work digitally as long as possible um and then to to link the digital and the physical world and this is something where i also see um the necessity in teaching so um regarding the the journey um we had so far with um our university you might see it's not a long one we started in the window semester 1920. um so actually we are teaching in the second year um clo at our university what you will see when it comes to the results i would say you cannot see um that we are only a two year starter um for me it feels more like um yeah it's something being part of our curriculum since years and also to the students it's like that um perhaps regarding um the timeline i wanted to highlight some things one game changer was the glow academic workshop to me personally the reason for that was not primary the skills i would say in terms of skills if you can teach one 3d tool the other ones are pretty easy to learn and especially close a really easy to learn tool but when it comes to tutorial database so like example files and all that stuff the the academic workshop is a complete game changer because what you will be provided with during this workshop in my personal opinion was for us the perfect start to train students with the key functionalities they need to know and to be expanded with more specific um topics and focus areas that we want to go on so if i want to to highlight one part which is super important i want to highlight the academic workshop um then directly after this workshop um corona came which made the workshop even more important to us because this was the basis for me and to build up an own tutorial database so i spoke in like hundreds of hours of playlists um to several topics for my students which are coupled in some kind of internal youtube to the cid database i was provided with um during this workshop and which was expanded by let's say some kind of own examples and this enabled us to go in summer semester 20 so after one half year into a 3d project with the students where we were working completely digital this idea was also like further in 2021 um semester where we made a further 3d project i'm also exclusively working on 3d and um during this time me my assistant researchers be it students or real employees work consistently in optimizing our tutorial database coming to khloe um so we have right now an english and the german database but also when it comes to adjacent tools like for example digitalization or fabrics um be it x tags photoshop when it comes to hardware and dream speed blender or fusion 360. so to link the framework even more and now the circle closes for let's say the yeah it's one and a half years um it's again the global academic workshop um i have to admit that this year it interferes for me a little bit with my lectures never the less i try to to be as long as possible in this workshop because to me it's really important first of all to get no to the other let's say professors or teachers um teaching chloe in their universities and schools and learn from them second of all um to me it's super important um due to be just in contact with the 3d community to exchange ideas between the different institutions um so so much as preliminary if you still have the possibility to go for this workshop do that um i can only recommend to do so um regarding let's say the challenges because we had challenges um there were let's say some basic questions that we had to ask ourselves our university being convinced that 3d is a must not a nice to have the question is how do i embed 3d in the curriculum they are in my personal opinion like some points that one could have a glance at first of all the question of digital swing like how do i digitally sue clothes or garments um starting with simple projects like t-shirts for example easy starter but we will come later on for the t-shirt because it's a perfect technology um that's a carrier to learn some stuff second virtual fit because in the bachelor we are um teaching an engineer and engineers on they need to assess they need to develop the products and so the fitting aspect is a pretty important one and then one adjacent issue which is 3d design because we are also having design classes at our engineering courses so the question how to introduce this in our lectures um this means that in some classes that's what you see for the traverses for example we are starting more with some kind of basic stuff okay the trousers doesn't look that easy but believe me after one or two months was working it's like a no-brainer um and the students have to deal with um where did they have issues how did i improve these issues how did i improve my pattern in star and stuff like that i'm going to perhaps the the next semester um where they are dealing with a little bit more sophisticated products including folds and all that stuff but it also comes more to rendering but also a more detailed assessment of fit like um where do i have inconsistencies why do i have these inconsistencies also they the patterns they have to see some are prepared perfectly some are prepared willingly false um in order to them to force them to to find um let's say some space of improvement and this led to us due to some let's say success factors first of all we and we personally consider 3d as one standard skill in teaching as you can see as you can weld as you can knit um simulating in 3d working in 3d assessing products in 3d is a standard skill in my personal opinion um being blended with the physical skills um that we are teaching this means we have so far four digital construction lectures three of them related to 3d digital construction one is only pattern in cad so learning the basic skills how to do patterns learning the basic skills how to make this in cid starting in two we still have like 50 pattern skills and 25 percent cad 25 basics in 3d which is enhanced um in digital construction 3 where we also have like the 25 25 50. um this means we always link pattern design with cad with simulation these products they are also linked to the manufacturing in these semesters so we are either manufacturing these products in our manufacturing um lectures or are manufacturing equivalent products what does this help to our students they are building up feedback loops because in order to work perfectly in 3d you have to understand the feedback loops between the physical and the real world in the fourth semester we go to the digital construction four which only focuses in 3d so there it goes to rendering there it goes to high-end publishing um we use 3d um from the next semesters on because we are hoping not only to work digitally in our lectures anymore but also can go more and more again in the physical teaching to see 3d as some kind of standard skill and project so if we are manufacturing products be it garments but also be it non-garments that can be simulated in clo we will do the simulations in clo um if it comes for example to design lectures or other ones um 3d is also some kind of let's say standard skill because if you're doing 2d fabric design for example you can assess the visualization of your results directly in 3d currently we think of some kind of white label simulation basis i guess every one of you who ever dealt with 3d projects is familiar with this um expression for those who aren't um we make like white t-shirts um being ready or white pull-overs or stuff like this and the students that just drag and drop their 2d fabric designs on these products and can visualize and imagine the outcome of their work in 3d i would say this teaches also the students to to have different approaches when to use 3d for which applications which is also super important in my my personal opinion and um frank also in the opinion of my colleagues um a success factor i already talked about um was in this the global academic workshop um i will attend this the next one as well um as far as i also attended um the last ones um so i can really recommend to you if you want to introduce 3d at your university or school attend this workshop because it's super helpful for networking and but also i have to admit like manuel he is right now not available for the next weeks perhaps but i got him to to note during this academic workshop and once i had a question i asked him like hey guy i don't know how to do this and like i don't know half a day later i got the answer and this is super speeding up um if you want to improve your work so this is also super important you get to know to the the close stuff and you know whom to ask if you have problems um this helps you super much it at least in the beginning of the teaching further success factor i would say is the question of the team with marina baum we have a creative part coming from the design world embracing 3d um so she's doing the nice part because i i'm personally you know i'm an engineer i don't care for the optics and this is also not my skill my skill is to make the framework running to to teach how to to use the tools um and she's the one teaching the students how to do this nicely how to get good um results and so i would say having first of all more than one skilled teaching person is super helpful and having several perspectives on the issue of 3d also helps super much when it comes to teaching material i have to admit i am investing super much time actually in every tool we are teaching to make my own playlists to make my own tutorial databases build on some best practices i got from the software manufacturers but also for some issues that i want to um to to focus on personally for example we are right now i'm dealing with a tutorial database for glb export out of clo i guess this is something which is super early for you um for us um it's the next thing to go because this is the 3d carrier format um which is i would say on an experimental stage and that's the reason why we are already investing here in the future um   finishing with this i want to go a little bit more in how we are teaching the 3d first i would say this is our workhorses like we are going for simple products in the beginning having a huge and fast success for the students like if you know how to do it you you are going to digitally see your t-shirts within less than five minutes um so you once you understand this you can go straight forward um if you are modifying patterns be it in clo or in a different cda program you can easily exchange patterns and it's like a question of seconds in the feedback loop second you can learn is the influence of the fabric or the 2d texture be it prints um be it like real fabrics these are simulations students of mine did in 2021 um and this in my perspective is a pretty easy starter like i can do digital suing i can um do like 3d design i understand the drag and drop part and um right here you see when it comes to the draping it's all the same physics in the in the fabrics but you could easily also exchange the physics so you could also easily understand the the influence of the the fabrics for the draping as it is in reality as well   you can link this with let's say the more sophisticated part of using the right textures because this has a huge influence on the plasticity of your products in the first lectures we do not deal with this but when it comes further on like digital construction 3 where you do your first rendering you see the influence of the maps in digital construction 4 you are building up your own maps and you're parameterizing them and then you see the real influence like the plasticity of your fabrics it starts to to live in this case and it's not more like some kind of plastic simulation stuff um where you think like oh okay this is a simulation um so the the evolving of um the ingredients we're adding to to the um simulations this is i would say something which is very important like easy starter and enriching the simulations um within the semesters with more and more information also building up in more and more more difficult projects which leads me to the following slide because there are challenges if you want to go further than just i would say the stunner simulation approach is because when it comes to hardware and trims you have to work sometimes with more than one tool if you want to make buckles if you want to make carry binds or your specific buttons and stuff like this um there are solutions to do so in cello but sometimes or also often there is the necessity to go for further tools like for example blender and fusion 360. um this can be for um when it comes to hang tags or as i said buckles where you you make an obj file you import it in clo and you use this for um the simulation as a hardware and trim i want to give a short um an overview of what we did for example to make um this face mask together with a carabine which we then attached to a outfit and we wanted to make an animation for this outfit and there's one thing one has to to understand in this context um clo can at the moment as far as i'm formed only animate one avatar um so um you have to to make some i would say tricks to to do this in a in an elegant way this um means um we made a first step a sketch we we did our first simulations had to improve some stuff um which was so far i would say as you see the the number of days like we are talking here of 11 days for starters um the students they were in this context being able to simulate t-shirts in the beginning of this process um they were working within a project not within a traditional lecture this is something one has to admit this means that they work like 20 hours per week within 3d this is also the reason why i would say you can see this huge involvement of this short amount of time um but this also leads me to the point that you need your standard lectures but you also need your integration in the projects because in the projects you have the time in the projects you can do the interesting stuff in the lectures you do the basics in order to be able to do the interesting stuff when it comes to yeah to the real issues um and what we did is we made this caribbean as an avatar we simulated the mask and all the other parts as a um as a garment and then we um transformed this one to a trim because this then is an object this object fell i can put a spawn part um on my outfit and trims i can use in my animations so by this one um we were able to to animate um i would say something i wouldn't call it complex but a little bit more non-standard um within some kind of outfit and also in terms of a little bit more sophisticated setting than just putting it on a picture because movement i would say is something which is pretty interesting because um when you come for example to um to publishing the traditional approach is like in the future we made pictures right now we are making pictures out of 3d as well but i would say you can do way more dynamics it's more like in the movies um if you think for example of deadpool where in the beginning you you see like the camera flows um through the entire scene and you get different angles of all of that cgi and 3d enables you to do the same um you can go do way more than just on the pictures you you can do more interactivity you can do more immersion when you sometimes go a little bit further than the traditional um i would say photo settings um   what i want to show after this is what you can achieve in projects um when you have the time to do so and you also have the ambition to push the students as hard as they can um what you see here um is a backpack simulated exclusively in clo um i have to admit that in some terms we couple clo to some let's say external rendering software sometimes we render in close sometimes we render out of outside of clo in digital construction for for example we will benchmark both like i'm rendering in clo rendering in a let's say several software um support the students in understanding like when is it feasible to go outside of the framework because um you need super much time sometimes to prepare your data to to get a little bit more quality and the question is is the payoff worth it so if you're going for example for a web presence with 720p um why why the heck you should go for 4k in rendering with hairiness and i don't know what because you won't see it on the screen and these are um the things for example which are one thing to understand the other one is to to push the technology how far you can go um and what i can tell you is that we learned um that the mesh you're getting out of silo works perfectly fine with um renderers outside of clo and also the rendering results within cloud are super super i would say sufficient for most of the cases   when you look more not only on the product but more in the setting you see that we combine for example the backpack with a warmer plate um so it's not only visualizing the product it's marketing also in the way of presenting the products so you're building your own settings um these are things you can do in silo as well you can use hdr is you can add obj files object files or 3d files for example for street lamps mark a student of mine made some guy jumping over a parkit bench right beneath a um a street light um all of this in clo um so you can do super much when it's when it comes to high end and you're willing to invest the time and what i personally um would say is if you're doing your job right and you see how to to go on the details you you barely see if it's a simulation or or not um same holds for example for this bag you see the texture is super important one of the major mistakes my students are making is they are doing a pretty good simulation with particle distance 20 for example um where you see when it comes to folds that you are having a simulation because you see the triangulation or when it comes to the textures because they just use the optics and not the physical maps like the normal maps the bump maps and all that stuff um the displacement which makes um the really 3d um impression of the fabric the leather and all that stuff later on um you can also use um your 3d tools to do more than the traditional visualization because if you do traditional visualization you can go just for most of the time entire garments but if you are here more into the padding the internal um let's say details of your puffer jacket in 3d it's like super easy you do like hidden height in 3d and you you can see the internals and you can do this in a high-end visualization like within minutes so if you have the project to get a picture like this if you've set everything perfectly up it's 20 minutes i would say if you have a good workstation and this is speeding up your your process super fast and um i can tell you if your students are realizing projects like this they are super happy i can't even tell you how much of motivation they are getting um from successes like that one um also when you you come to this one like being frank um the student that made that simulation they worked like two months on this for a starter i would say this is an awesome result because every week you saw what she was improving and how she was improving working on the details working a little bit more on the texture so this was her project improving it and i really would recommend you give them the time to do so because sometimes you need the time to improve it's the same like if you if you're going in professional sports you have to train some steps super often you have to make your mistakes and it's not you to solve the mistakes for the students it's you to teach them how to solve them to tell them okay you you need this map um here perhaps work with the elasticity in the scene you're not telling them the values you're not telling them the right parameters but you're telling them this is the function you have to have a glance at and then they're working with this like some hours some days depends on the speed of the student and then they understand the function they need to make their own mistakes they need to make their own learnings and then they can transfer it to other garments these are also products of students of mine i can tell you this taping was some kind of a real pain um i personally had also to learn much um in this context because when it comes to seams i would say it seems this pretty straightforward um i i know it from other tools i love it from zelo perfectly and i first of all had to understand the taping solution um but but once you understand it um it's also again pretty straightforward it's like if you're riding a bicycle or if you are able to walk once you can do it um you can apply it again and again and perhaps you can see one further thing i would say for example if you go to to mark's jacket or to the puffer jacket you saw before students they can do as good simulations that you can't even distinguish if they are pictures or cgi pictures and these students they were like in the fifth semesters so they are way away from junior level when it comes to designers or industry and this is something making me for some part proud and making me also for some point believing in 3d to be the real game changer when these students enter industry because they know how to do the stuff for sure they will have to go for higher output because if you are at the garment company you have to do not only one model or two models a week you have to do like real high output but you're getting better and um i would say using the learning curve the skills you already have um my personal opinion is we will face visualizations like that um within like the next half year or year like yeah it's standard this is something one can easily achieve what you can also see here is like you can really work with your surroundings in 3d this one made in steel oh this one made in in a different rendering tool you see there is barely no difference i personally can only tell you that it's in two different tools because i know which one isn't right and right when in which one but um if you don't know i i would say there's no difference um which also i would say perfectly shows you how powerful um you can use this in your teaching and being frank if you have for example something like that prepared for your design classes for example if the students are working on more or less the same products each semester um and you're having here your hdri and all that stuff your lighting and all that stuff and the students are going for example for the the fabric design or the details it will be super motivating because the output it will be like high high-end with comparably less work for the students and motivations is so much important in this part the last thing i wanted to show to you is something my student made on last semester the trailer or clip you are seeing was made after 15 weeks of work these students they had one lecture in clo so they were the first ones i'm learning clo after that they went to um to industry because in our um teaching it's like between the last i would say lecture where you do the traditional skills in the industrial project you're doing an internship so these students they they worked before of that half of a year with clo and you can see the result they they made after further half of a year right now working an industrial [Applause]   project   so     [Applause]   okido i guess that skilled eyes can see that there is space to improve because for example if you go for the skateboarder i would say the textures um they would be something i would change because you see they used not all the maps they should go on and also in some renderings you see there's a little bit of graining um which is something oh being the result of our limited computation capacities at our university um but in general i would say if you see what not even young professionals can do after like 15 weeks i would say this is some kind of amazing and the details i am criticizing right here at the moment i would say they are compared to what they achieved like really really minor things that are also really easy or it would be really easy to improve in the future   um in my feedback i got from the students they told me this was exactly the right project also at the right time because corona time showed industry you need to go digital and i would say like 40 to 50 percent of our students um they want to go that way um i also have to admit the other 40 to 50 um they want to go more in the physical way they say i need to touch the fabric i need to smell it to to be in the production which is also i would say some kind of valid decision you know not everyone is a techie guy not everyone is a production guy so this is perfectly fine also when it comes to to the future let's say realization saying digital and physical it's an xor i would not agree as well because you know or you need to know when you go digital and you need to go when to go physical and you need to know how to link both of that um and so perhaps one message which which is super important from my or in my perspective is do not do like um you only have to go 3d do not do like three something i would never ever look at because um real government makers have to only work haptically with your their hands um it's more like if you go to mechanical engineering um you have to be skilled in both worlds and there are experts still more when it comes to the physical part there are exports more when it comes to the digital part they are the linking elements that are skilled in both and i believe that it's our mission um to to train the young professionals especially for that it's the decision of the students where they say okay that's my focus area um but we need to um to supply them with the right teaching to get good in their um focus areas and i can tell you my students they yeah average half of them really lost 3d and also is pushing super hard to go in industry in 3d and i can tell you as well for them it's super easy to get a job right at the moment um for me it's harder to feed the jobs i'm getting from industry with my students then um to to get my students to work um because like every large and garmin enterprise right at the moment is hiring um in 3d be 3d artists be it more in the simulation part be it more like in the i.t part like you have in solution architecture stuff like this um because if you're getting solution architect for mechanical engineering he doesn't understand the garment world so you need lots of skills in this area and i can tell you if you do um improve yourself in this part um my perspective your university will benefit from that i can tell you ours did and will do as well in the future i guess um this brings me nearly to the end of my presentation so having so far achieved what we have um there's huge space for improvement why is it so i would say 3d is a pretty young domain when it comes to our industry so one really has to keep the pace with the technology which evolves super fast that's something perhaps which is important to know um if you are doing more like standard teaching it's super easy because um the standards they they work stable like i would say 2015. um when it comes to the more sophisticated stuff clo and all the other tools they are super agile like they are super fast new functions you improve your workflows you you can do more let's say um sophisticated simulations and you also will need um in my prospective tools around this for example beatblender be it um fusion360 orbit bizu or photoshop to make the ingredients for your simulation um you can make patterns in clo this is also something where we are doing some tutorials right at the moment like we are doing patterns in the let's say traditional cd programs we are doing the patterns in the clo program we are like inter linking um the pattern world like how can i make the cello patterns producible we how can i make a production pattern capable of a good way of simulation and also when it comes to the rendering and publishing part because it's not only always production there are multiple tools um that one can use in our ecosystem and but that's only our ecosystem you could go for super many other tools um we use clo for rendering and publishing i can only recommend you also to have a glance at gltf i'm personally super convinced that this is one of the big things in the future we also go for blender because it is a super awesome fever in my eyes and with the new version you have also a very very powerful render renderer within blender we go for keyshot which is a professional tool for rendering um where you can work a little bit more in the details and we also go for unity when it comes to hr and we are having this one also linked to a let's say further cloud-based framework so see the 3d simulation more is part in the future of a process chain because you do not do 3d simulation just for i have a 3d simulation and i have a picture it's more like an asset you have a 3ds set and you can do stuff with these things you can use them in teaching for different aspects but also when it comes to industry you will have to use it in different aspects and it's you to teach your students um how to do so so you need to understand um when the process starts and then when the process ends um yeah so far i would say i'm at the end um yeah great thank you so much um it was really really good to see also from your perspective for more from uh also closing technology perspective where you teach um yeah engineers um when using chloe as well that was really great um for us it was a little bit different to the other sessions that's for sure um so yeah thanks again for this really insightful presentation and for how you use um khloe in projects and also used in your curriculum in just a small amount of time because you actually have not joined um the cloud community that long ago so really great to see how you involved um using khloe in your university so now it's time for some questions and we have already received a few of the questions i'm gonna um yeah uh moderate this a little bit and walk you through the questions but if you feel like you you don't want to use the chat um you really want to ask directly please um raise your virtual hand and i will get to you and unmute you um so really be feel free to make this um an interactive q and a session as well so let me have a look into the chat there is a question from emma um so mr kaiser do you teach them to animate the animation part also between the two teachers so you um and your colleague or um or another or in another course so was this the final video put together by by them or a different department as the animation is another skill to learn um actually this was um just within one project in the lectures they also learn how to make the animations but um in um this context it was just like um one one entire course um which is like to better understand they worked like three days per week um in this issue like they get a task each semester and their task was to make a digital collection also make digital presentation of that and some if you make do you mean animation in terms of making the movie or animation in terms of making the animation within the simulation perhaps to my better understanding i don't know emma animation the movie is her answer oh the movie okay being frank we have the adobe creative cloud um tool set at our university and um luckily each semester there are like five one or two hands of students that are super skilled in terms of making movies so this is not a skill that we are teaching but this is a skill that i would say our 3d students they already have because they just love this digital world and so i would say our 3d expert students they went um in making this um in this clip but it's nothing that we are teaching in the bachelor we are doing some stuff when it comes to that in the master great another question that follows directly after this one is from the end shows so she says super interesting presentation and would you be able to share the video because she thinks that it would be a great motivation for her students um to show them what um your students in ibstead achieved actually they are on youtube um if it's okay to you i i will forward the link to you natalie and then you can provide it to the audience yes that's great um that's another thing we got we'd like to do later on to also make sharing and possible so that's a great idea um another question is do you have a course to achieve more realism in fabrics um in the master yes um in the bachelor we are going a little bit more in the basics like we have in the knitting area of course is where we are reeling doing the the 2d design like with also specialized software um in the master we are going more for the multiple um choices like be it leathery bit woven speed knitting knitting and all that stuff so we are trying to build up the skills um okay great um let's move a little bit forward because um forward because i think here another question would have been maybe you can explain again um do all your students have pattern cutting knowledge before your specific course yes um each student of us perhaps this is also important to know the students cannot choose if they are doing pattern that you students cannot choose if they are doing 3d so there are skills we consider to be necessary or crucial and we consider these skills to be crucial have you also used khloe in draping class or do you have any ideas of how khloe can be used to teach draping skills yes good question um we did then corona came then we did not anymore we will again after corona yeah that makes sense i can tell you there were lots of learnings um actually there was some kind of mean because we used the size germany um fitting models um the eye size um mannequins for the real draping and in chloe the mannequins are a little bit different also when it comes to posture and the students they head to the turn the task to align their simulation with the real fitting and they were in the keynoting like oh it's looking super differently and they had to understand like if i have a mannequin standing like this in a mannequin like that this makes it different if you go for the precise measurements this makes a difference and only after that as they understood that they are different um they got the right mannequin to do so so yes um if i have the chance to do so we are doing this great another great question is from marion how does khloe connect to weaving simulation software do you have to adapt the scale and the scale yourself by hand or do you dimension match automatically do you have any experience in that i can only tell you that we are using coppermon and with coppermine it's super easy um so the scaling is no issue i cannot tell you for penelope or equivalence or eit softwares because i did not make the files on my own um i can tell you the software files i got um they just worked like drag and drop so most of the time no issue yeah i can kind of confirm from close side when it comes to penelope for example we are not officially integrated but it's workable so yeah just try out and it will work and janet walk general question is where can you find the course information maybe you can also share that later with us and you mean the core um course information you mean the description of the modules or what we are doing yeah i understand the question to be like that okay um i will provide you with that cool uh then also another question would be how many semesters to khloe master study um actually only on a um voluntarily basis because in the master we have a more or we have more freedoms of choice because when it comes to the master we we differentiate a little bit more when it comes to like closed frameworks when it comes to open frameworks both of them having their advantages and disadvantages and our masters they specialize either in the one world or in the other one but our master is running two semesters and they can tell you that each semester every time has at least um for svs um so for svs it's like three hours per week on 3d at least okay great and i think since you mentioned keyshot as another rendering machine there would be a question of can you make animations in keyshot yes you can um the alembic transfer is a little bit of a pain we go over mixamo right at the moment because this helps us for the interfacing um but when it comes to animations i have to admit things sometimes get dirty um so it's not that straightforward as you go forward like a a posture this is also something which will never in my perspective be part of the teaching in the close side because there you need completely or really really deeper skills when it comes to 3d and also um preparation of the 3d data but this is super awesome when it comes to projects and then also when it comes to bachelor or master thesis because there is the students they learn the the really hard stuff okay that's really great in general also to see how you embed reality khloe in a in a 3d ecosystem i think this is also what we're um recommending to the industry and already seeing that you do that it's really really good to see also um then there would be a lot of thank yous for this great presentation and information um and maybe if anyone has a last question is there anything erasing otherwise i would then be closing the session for today as we received a lot of very insightful information yes and someone already pressed the share button thank you patricia because that would be my next topic um that if you like to share um your contact details with all the participants of today's session in able to really make sharing um possible with in in within the academic world we would suggest for you to type into the chat um just simply share then we're gonna share the contact information after the session and finally i also would like to thank all of you for participating today and especially thank you mr kaiser for um for sharing all that wonderful information and how you inter created khloe in such a short amount into your curriculum and also using it for this wonderful industrial project which i find really inspiring as well and very valuable as we learned also for the students to to to work within the project using co um yes so we're just going to stay a little bit more online for everyone to have the chance to press the share button for help also in this context because i work for the first time with zoom um where do i push the share button oh we're gonna um we're gonna include you um for sure in the in the sharing um in the sharing list because you're presented today uh but yes in the chat there's multiple sharing um suggestions so that's really great and also already an email that is shared directly wonderful thank you so much everyone for um participating that's really great to see that you won't like to be connected with each other amazing so it's really warm here in germany   and really wonderful weather today let's hope for the best that it's after the after hour today's work day that we're gonna have the ability to stay out in the sun a little bit oh there's another question yes and the question would be how to get access to the last session from last week so we asked our presenters if we can uh record and we recorded some of the sessions and we we're looking forward to making some of the sessions available in on our youtube channel as well so you could also have a look on some of the presentations afterwards again all right i think we received a lot still receiving information here perfect great great great all right good then i think um everyone had the chance to really share their email addresses or press the share button so again um mr kaiser thank you so much for for being a presenter of our our first academic month it was the last session and we really had a lot of fun to um to do to organize that and um yeah i guess we're gonna stay in touch and uh everyone who wants to i just want to promote also uh one last time as mr kaiser already did he promoted our workshop so there is going to be another basic course next week starting from monday till wednesday so if you would like to be trained by one of our 3d designers and a basic course please um sign up for it because after the course next week there is going to be a long time not another course because we're gonna actually do an advanced workshop in autumn for all our academic um clients as well so um take the basic course next week and then maybe you can also join our advanced course in autumn planned in autumn this year yes you do you will need the software um for next week so please feel free to reach out to us again if you don't have academic licenses um already we need to talk about that as well okay great so thanks so much again and take care and see you around bye bye   ",

        "Transcript": "in this video we are going to go through how to create a garment pigment wash effect on a classic tee the first thing i'm going to do is create the wash out look that you see on the seams of a pigment wash i'm going to do this by using my top stitch tool here my default top stitch i'm going to select this first thing i'm going to do is change the type so instead of using an obj type i'm going to use a texture this is because i don't want my wash to be a hard object it's going to just be a texture on it next i'm going to change the texture of the top stitch so i'm going to go into my file open and bring in one of the brushes that i've created in illustrator so here i have my brush and i'm going to open that up the properties in the tip in the property editor are going to change slightly for this top stitch i'm now going to use my segment top stitch tool and apply this wash effect on all of the areas of the shirt that i would see this in real life as you can see this is just like applying it as any regular top stitch since i want my neckline to be a little bit different from the rest of the body i'm going to create a separate top top stitch wash for my neckline i'm just going to select this and assign my second top stitch to that neckline here i'm going to change with the offset a little bit more so that i can see this a little bit better now i'm going to go in and play around with the offset of my body so that i can see that a little bit more i'm also going to flip this top stitch to make sure that it's going in the right direction as you can see editing this wash effect is just like editing any top stitch that you normally would within cloud all of the same basic principles apply i'm now going to go in and change my color to a color that's closer to the body so that this all looks a little bit more realistic i'm going to do the same with the neckline but for here i'm going to have a little bit of a lighter color once this is set i'm now going to go to my fabrics and add in the all over wash for the fabric i'm doing this through our multi-texture editor tool here i'm going to add an all-over wash that i've created in illustrator as well and just use this wheel to make it larger turn on my desaturation and change the color to a color closer to the shirt i'm also going to make it a little bit lighter so that i can see it a little bit better once this is done i've now created a pigment wash effect on this basic tee the last step would just be to render this out or add any other top stitching that i would and here you can see a rendered garment with using this technique i hope you enjoyed this video thank you for watching you ",
        "Summary": "### Comprehensive Guide to Creating a Garment Pigment Wash Effect on a Classic Tee This guide will walk you through the step-by-step process of creating a pigment wash effect on a classic tee using a design software, likely a 3D garment design tool. The effect mimics the worn-out look typically found on garment seams. #### Definitions - **Pigment Wash Effect**: A technique that gives fabric a faded, vintage appearance, particularly at seams and edges. - **Top Stitch Tool**: A tool used to create stitches along the edges of fabric in design software. - **Texture**: A visual representation of a surface, often used to add depth and realism to a design. - **Multi-Texture Editor**: A tool that allows for the application of multiple textures and effects to a garment. ### Step-by-Step Instructions #### Step 1: Set Up Your Workspace 1. **Open Your Design Software**: Launch the software you will be using for garment design. 2. **Create New Project**: Start a new project for your classic tee design. #### Step 2: Create the Wash Out Look 1. **Select the Top Stitch Tool**: Locate and select the default top stitch tool in your software. 2. **Change the Type**: - Instead of using an OBJ type, select the texture type. This ensures the wash will not appear as a hard object but rather as a soft texture. #### Step 3: Import Your Brush 1. **Open Your Brush**: - Navigate to the file menu and select ‘Open’. - Import a brush that you have previously created in Illustrator, which will be used for the washing effect. #### Step 4: Apply the Wash Effect 1. **Select the Segment Top Stitch Tool**: Use this tool to apply the wash effect on the areas of the shirt that typically show wear. 2. **Adjust for Neckline**: - Create a separate top stitch for the neckline to differentiate it from the body of the tee. - Select the neckline area and assign the second top stitch to it. #### Step 5: Modify Offsets and Directions 1. **Adjust Offsets**: - Change the offset of the body and neckline top stitches to ensure they are visible and aligned as desired. 2. **Flip the Top Stitch**: Make sure the top stitch is oriented correctly; you may need to flip it so that it runs in the desired direction. #### Step 6: Change Colors 1. **Select Realistic Colors**: - For the body, choose a color that closely matches the shirt’s fabric. - For the neckline, opt for a slightly lighter color to create contrast. #### Step 7: Add All-Over Wash 1. **Access the Multi-Texture Editor**: - Use this tool to apply an overall wash effect to the fabric of the tee. 2. **Import Your Wash Texture**: - Similar to importing the brush, open and apply the wash texture you created in Illustrator. 3. **Adjust Size and Color**: - Use the scaling wheel to enlarge the texture. - Turn on desaturation and adjust the color to be closer to the shirt fabric, making it lighter for visibility. #### Step 8: Final Adjustments 1. **Check Your Work**: Review all elements to ensure the wash effect looks realistic and cohesive. 2. **Render the Garment**: Once satisfied, proceed to render the garment to visualize the final product. ### Tips and Tricks - **Use High-Quality Textures**: Ensure that the textures you create or import are high resolution to achieve a realistic effect. - **Experiment with Colors**: Don’t hesitate to try different shades and opacities to see what works best for your design. - **Save Your Brushes**: If you create a custom brush or texture, save it for future use to streamline your workflow. - **Preview Often**: Regularly render or preview your garment to see how changes affect the overall look. - **Layering Techniques**: Consider layering multiple textures for a more complex and interesting wash effect. ### Conclusion By following these steps and utilizing the tips provided, you can effectively create a pigment wash effect on a classic tee that enhances its aesthetic and gives it a vintage appeal. Happy designing!"
