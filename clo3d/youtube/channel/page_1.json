        "Transcript": "I'm Daniel 3D design and implementation specialist at CL in Munich and we will start with today's skillup session on creating a virtual showroom in CL and we will use the the everywhere plugin a little bit hopefully you have it if you don't have it you can download it from connect from our website and it's up here but normally you have to register for it uh there will also be in the chat there will also be um questions that will come up um during the the whole session um if you see them you can um or it would be nice if you answer them it's a few questions on this skillup or for the next one um but yeah okay so I am inside our project folder the one that I shared with you that you hopefully downloaded and I put this here on my local drive on my desktop in this case so I can work with it um we have a few folders here that I prepared beforehand uh we have some avatars we have some garments uh renderings that are prepared in the room so the first thing I want you to look at don't follow me on this one is this I named this especially warning this is a big file um and I can open it up and share you what's inside but uh I would recommend that you only open this up if you have a powerful computer some people cannot some people cannot see my screen okay then let me reshare my screen okay yeah but you can you see my desktop yeah okay yeah I need to minimize the window that's why I cannot see what you're writing that's a bit pity I only have one screen at the moment so I open up the warning big project and this is basically what we are trying to build here I deactivated everything so we have a little bit of better performance here I can activate it again and this this is basically what we are trying to build today so I built a whole room in CL it's all patent pieces uh that I put together and then I put all the garments inside but the problem is that this file now is super heavy and Al only heavy computer or like super powerful computers can handle this uh anymore um so what I want you to show is first of all um a good statistic statistic setting kind of that we can um take to um to see how big this file is and this is up here in settings then in display environment and here's a setting that is called show frame rate so here comes up um a little writing and this is what we want to focus on so the first one is uh row of numbers is 1.4 million triangles Tris ISRO for triangles 750,000 ver is vertices 448 patterns 15 Trims sewings and so on the last one is 12 CPU cores this is what uh the computer that I'm working with today is using and then here we actually have the frame rates so the frame rates is showing me the um how how big the the the frame rates are for my 3D window so if I move around you can see the numbers are changing hopefully you see it it's not stuttering for you but uh this is showing me um how it's updating the 3D window but the thing that I want to um show you especially here is um where we can see um how big our project is and this is 1.4 million triangles as I said before and this is quite big um and um so the the bigger this is because we we I um added garments here that have a particle distance of five um like sunglasses here on the table that you can see um they even have a partic distance of three and so on so this adds like more and more data so it makes the quality better but it adds more and more data so the project becomes heavier and heavier and this is something that we need to optimize so that's why I wanted just to show you what is going on so just build a room here so it's basically like a pattern piece with a window from outside so later if we are rendering from inside then we will not see that and also this this has a ceiling a roof here are on top but I made it invisible so here it is um yeah so everything is a patent piece I just build it um the walls for example they just have like additional rendering thickness of 600 in this casee and um yeah it's all like um true to life size so like the walls are like 3.5 MERS tall and so on but um yeah this is just an example so because this file is so heavy um and if we would start the render here and we want to to render out this image what we will do later this will take like super long so I want to show you a few ways on how to optimize the scene and we are doing this I will close this now you can follow me I will open up the in the project folder room thing I want to open up this project file that is called showroom optimized now we just quickly open it up so this file is only the room without the garments um and I will show you I optimized it before but I will show you what I did here so I deleted all the avatars all the garments and so on um but I will show you what I did here um so here our changing room the chairs the plant this is actually a mirror even though you cannot see it at the moment the shelves and so on we will fill this now with the garments um but first of all let's work on the room itself so at the moment the room let me quickly format my background back so we can see a little bit better I want to go in again display environment show frame rate I can see that the roam alone now that I optimized it already beforehand is 63,000 so it's a lot less already and I will show you what I did with it so for the walls for example they are just straight right um so first of all I want to come to the Garment rendering style here in the 2D window and I want to change this to show mesh and now you can see already kind of what I did is I changed for all the square pieces the particle distance super high so for example if I click on the wall here you can see that the particle distance is set up to 500 um and what it's doing like because it's just like a um a plane and it has nothing it's it doesn't need any like folds and so on I can set the particle distance super far up and it will still be um so the edes are super clear nothing is like wonky or looks distorted or anything um so that's why we can do this we can of course not do this with things like for example the STS here for the for the mannequins later because um this would um distort the shape the round shape of the um objects um so yeah that's what I did with uh these things what I also did to optimize these garments to make the size of it the complete size of it smaller is if I go on one of my pattern pieces for example again this wall door side and if I come to my property editor and I open up this mesh um uh setting here you can see that I changed the mesh type from triangle to quads I can quickly show you what happen so hopefully you can read it here at the moment it says face count and vertex count so like vertices and triangles what I said before 196 and 233 if I now change it back just to show you to triangles you can see it is a lot more 6 and 336 so that's why we can change things to quads so we uh have the same quality I will mention something later but um yeah we can save a lot of resource the problem with the quads is that the quads are not really working so well with round shapes that's why I only use this or most of it only for like Square pieces and not for round shapes um because you see it here if I would update the particle distance for this round shape of the windows for example to 500 you can see that the if I zoom into the windows you can see that the windows actually become super edgy here on the so it's not round anymore it becomes edgy so this is the problem with the quads the triangles are a little bit better for round shapes the quads for um Square shapes um so here we have to be careful at set it to quads but I can I cannot put this um up too much otherwise I would lose my details here so that's why I changed it to 200 we could even go lower because it's still a little bit we still have a little bit of edges here but the problem with the optimization and like lowering the particle distances and so on we need to find a balance between like quality and uh optimization so that is always like a little bit that you have to figure out in your projects um but yeah this is basically what I did so I updated the particle distance I made turn it super up to sometimes 500 for example here with the with the closing wack inside this is less this is only 20 but yeah something that is reasonable and still looks good and for the small parts the smaller the parts get the higher or lower however you want to put it the particle distance has to be that's something that you cannot uh change but you can see I mean it's still 68 vertices face count and so on so that would be all fine yeah so this is basically what I did so I optimized it already for you um and I brought this down I think to a third of the original triangle count so I don't know it was like 240,000 before and I brought it down to 60 60,000 um so that the the whole file becomes a little bit lighter um what I now want to do is I want to optimize it even more because uh at the moment it's all patent pieces and actually I don't want this to um behave like patent pieces anymore I want to export this as an obj to save even more resources because objs are easier to handle um than pieces and particle distance and so on so we kind of will bake the whole project of the room and I will simply do this by coming up here um to file to export and then oh one thing I purposely want to um leave out the ceiling and Export them separately so um we have to do it a little bit different I will press control a or command a depending on if you're working on Mac or Windows and I will hold down shift to deselect the ceiling and now I want to come to file export and then I want to say obj selected because only the selected shapes I want to export then I need to find a folder in our case I already placed the folder it's empty yet um in the project folder in room it's a folder called obj and I will go inside and then I will name my file I will call it showroom project and then I can say save and then this obj dialogue box comes up and this is what is important for us because there we need to say what is happening so we want to not select all patterns because we left out the ceiling of course but what is very important is we want to put this to thick because our walls are ex thick not thin and the rest we can basically leave the scale is millimeter and we can save the textures uh as absolute textures uh image file path and then we can say okay wait for it to export and then if we would go back to our folder here on my desktop in my case in room make it bigger in obj here is now our whole room with the textures okay and now we will do the same thing again but only with the ceiling so I will just select the ceiling I will come to file export obj selected in the same folder if you want you can also save it somewhere else um I will call this go room ceiling and then say okay do the same thing again turn to thick even though it has I think no yeah no thickness at all let's just leave it there it's always better then we can leave the rest and we can just say okay now if we go back to our folder now I can see that here is an obj file showroom ceiling. obj and showroom project. obj okay that is already it for the room so far I already built it for you so you don't have to do anything and optimize it um the next thing I want to do before bringing the garments and the um the the room together in one project I want to um open up another file I will close this one or we can also leave it here it's fine um in the project folder I want to now go into to the folder called garments and here we have two files so I I packed for you so we have all the single garments here inside and I also made packs of garments that have like all the garments for the from The Clothing Rack all the garments for the um the sunglasses display and so on but you don't have to do this we want to work on this one one before and it's called m main outfit and we can just drag and drop this inside of our previous project and instead of like adding it to it now we want to open this up and wait for it quickly to load and now I will show you a way um to optimize this garment uh that we can yeah reduce the size of it let's see where are my pent pieces here um and still have a quite good quality um so our um frame rate is still showing so I can see that at the moment uh I think the particle distance here was set to five when I created it um by the way we are here at CL Beach Club so the room is like a a surf shop or something like this um 381,000 triangles so again this is quite a lot I mean we have a lot of um we have a lot of uh details here that we of course don't want to lose too much by the optimization uh methods but um yeah I want to show you how I can easily reduce um or optimize this garment with the everywhere tool um depending on the version that you have I'm working in the newest version for us it's uh 20 24.1 142 um there you can find the everywhere plugin up here if you go up to connect then here it says everywhere if you have a lower version for whatever reason it might be that you have like a little puzzle piece or something here in the corner uh that should say everywhere beta um so you can also exit it there in my case have to go to connect and then to everywhere so this little window comes up it's again called everywhere beta and here uh it now displayed us automatically kind of the same stats as here the polygon count for the Garment and for the avatar for the Avatar we cannot change it but for the Garment we can change it so it says 381,000 and now I want to lower it down to a third of the of the size of it so I will set this up to 100,000 I spelled correct yeah 100,000 um vertices 100,000 triangles and then I have to click on optimize and it takes a while to compute but in the end now if I look here after the process it says 96,000 triangles so it tries to reduce it below the number that I put so I set 100,000 and it tries to be below that um so that's what it did so it it did it automatically for for the whole uh garment so if I now click on a on one of the pattern pieces I can see that it automatically turned the particle distance to 10 we click to the other pieces that might have been bigger or something here can see the particle distance was automatically set to 10.3 and here for the scuba like 10.2 so yeah so it reduced everything to come below the thresold kind of of 100,000 and that is basically it it's all what I'm doing I mean the the everywhere plugin is also capable of like rigging if you wanted to export to games and so on we also if we click here on the on the channel material we can also pack our UVS here and um we can create material list and upload to uh uh to connect and then download again if you wanted to but in our case this is not really important we are just using this to Simply optimize our garment below a certain threshold so I just turn in or put in the number then I click optimize and that's it and then I can hit close and that's already good to go so for this I want to save this now so I will go to file save as Pro project and yeah it's okay um I will basically call it the same as before M main outfit but I will say underscore optimized and then I can say save okay so far so good what I want to do with it is I want to display on the back on the pedestal I think it's called Uh on the back of the room I want to display the same outfit also on a female Avatar and on a kids Avatar and I want to show you an an easy way on how to do this like without grading it's not that accurate of course but it's an easy way to like out ofit the Garment on a different Avatar so for this you can come up here to your all I think I have to delete my avatar right click delete Avatar and then I want to come back to our project folder and then I will double click on avatars and here you can see um the avatars that I use for this in this case I downloaded them from connected from our official U CL connect uh page on connect Marketplace um and I just download downloaded it for you here inside so you don't have to do this so now I want to load in FV 2.1 mannequin so this is the faceless manin that I was using here but the male version now I want to load in the female version here she is and now I want to quickly check something it's not here okay that's fine then I have to go without shoes so when we have the Avatar in and we have the m outfit now I want to automatically fit the Garment without going through the poe again without like using the arrangement points again to put this uh here and like fit the pant again and so on I quickly want to do this and we can do this by coming down here in our 2D tools and here it's called Uh Auto fitting and we can uh quickly click on it by the way it's a good tip and to keep the avatars in an A or t pose because if the arms are too close then this algorithm is not working so well so it's um it needs to be in an A or t pose um so um this is all fine we don't want to keep the graphic size or Texture size we want to like shrink this down as well so we can leave everything here and we can say okay then it takes a while to compute there we go and now you can see that it automatically draped the Garment not only on the female Avatar but also like in the pose that hasn't been there before um and it reduced the size so you can see it here by this reference lines that automatically were created it reduced also the the size of the pattern pieces so as I said before it's not like it's not like grading it's not really grading this function was called before Auto grading now it's called Auto fitting because it's not really grading it's just like reducing it um by this algorithm and fits it at as best as it and on the new Avatar but I think that's good enough for us um I will quickly uh right click on now on the hand and I want to say move all avatars and garments to ground because um unfortunately I don't have in the library the flipflops that I wanted to use uh sorry for that but um that's fine so now she sits completely on the ground and move around but what I can do is I can also bring her arms down if I go into my library I open this up with the letter Y by the way then we go to Avatar to female V2 to pose and every one of you should have the the post file uh fv2 03 attention so I will just use this and I will say okay and I will bring this down like this okay if we have done this then we can save this again I will go to file save as project but now I will call this I just clicked here to get the name copied automatically but I will call this F main outfit optimized and Save and now we want to do this again I will delete the female Avatar I will go into our folder with the avatars and I want to load in the k v1.1 b mannequin so it's a it's a boy here he is a lot shorter of course and then we want to come over here and say autof fitting again dialog box comes up you have nothing to change here say okay now we wait for it to drape there we go so we can see already like by the two times reduction that we have a little bit of issues here with the with the Hem not being correctly or it's a little tangled up and so forth so I said it's just easy optimization it's not perfect so if you have to make it perfect then you better um work on it um with actual grading but I just wanted to show you a quick way to do this then again to our library two avatars to kits to pose and then here again we have an attention pose 03 attention a double click po only maintain a size align bottom to ground yes leave or let the arms come down close the library and then I want to again save this save as project and now I will take the name again but now I want to name it K main outfit optimized and then say safe so far so good I don't know what you're doing let me see yeah okay okay okay um yes Andre you will be able to watch this again later because this will be recorded and after the session this will be automatically sent out to you from deu all right cool so now that we have saved it we can open up a new project and now finally start to assemble the room and the whole garments so the first thing I want to do is I want to come to our project folder go to the room go in our folder where we saved the room as obj and I want to drag and drop the first element inside which is the showroom project. obj or project um here is the dialog box that comes up we will say open we can leave it at Avatar that's fine um the scale we set to millimeter when we exported it we don't need any Arrangement points or fitting suit it will just act as an avatar but it's it's not actually an avatar as you used to so we can turn this off nothing to change here and we can say okay there we go it might be a little bit difficult so I just press two on my keyboard and then if you rotate around it becomes a little bit easier to find the project here inside don't worry about the little I don't know end Wars um Distortion effect here the further I go away from it uh the worse it becomes the closer you go in the less it becomes until it's completely gone so this is just like in graphical U display thing um but if you render it later and so on this is not a problem anymore so don't worry about it okay and now we also want to bring in our showroom seiling so showroom ceiling. obj don't confuse it with the MTL uh file so uh seeing. obj we want to add this in but of course in this case we don't want to say open but we want to change this to add leave everything as it is and then we say okay so now we have our ceiling but we can actually click on the ceiling and open this up like a box I will just I just clicked here on the on these arrows and I will just open it up like a little toy box or like a like a what is it like a a puppet house not puppet yeah you know what I mean um because uh I tried this before uh with the ceiling also closed and then it was really hard to navigate inside of the room and uh then I exported it separate and now the navigation here is a lot easier so um we can now start to bring in the main outfit garments that we just optimized so I will go again to my project folder where I save them in garments and I will uh bit after bit bring in all my assets here I will start with my M outfit bring it in uh we want to add this don't want to open this um and we can leave the render properties off but we want to have the Avatar okay then we can say okay wait until it loads and here it is so a little problem in CL that you might have seen before is now that I have this loaded in and I have my Gizmo here showing so this thing is called the Gizmo um and if I move this around I'm not moving around the Avatar with it so this is a little problematic I know this but this is uh it's so far not possible to move the uh Avatar after you placed it once but we can use a little trick and that is I will first of all move the Garment here next to the pedestal in the area and now I want to come to my project folder and add in the same Avatar again and that is is the MV 2.1 mannequin in our Avatar folder I want to bring it in no I don't want to save this file yet and here very important that you say add again not open and now if I say okay um it's even able to take for some files I noticed um the post file so we will change this from maintain current size to open size and post from the AR file and you can say okay now it's a little bit zoomed out but if I zoom in again now you see that I have an avatar inside and the Gizmo and if I now move the Gizmo then I can change the Avatar so this is only possible if you add in a second avatar so with this said I will bring my avatar here in the middle and then I want to turn him and move him around in the this 3D space until his foot is a little bit lck on this little stand here H it doesn't need to be perfect it's just a demonstrate of course so I just move this here um maybe I need to turn him a little bit you bit Yeah like this put inside okay and I can already delete the first aat here because I don't need it anymore so I will just press delete on my keyboard and now I have to manually move my garments on top of my avatar again which is a little bit of work I know but the only way to get our garments again through the Avatar I'm avoiding to simulate anything in the scene because I don't know it might give us problems uh especially when we also add the avatar other garments that I prepared so the file becomes heavier again not like before 1.4 million triangles but um yeah this why I want to just move it here and it's of course depending on the whole scene the the store that I built here is quite big I know um just to show you like what's possible but um yeah so I'm already I did this like 10 times yesterday so I'm already quite good in moving the Garment here around um that's good enough for me it doesn't need to be perfect I'm just making sure that like the the legs are not sticking out of the pants here or like the scuba leggings uh and the arms are inside and so on so yeah this is perfect for me uh actually I will move the garments a little bit up because the other garments will also be here in the 2D SC uh in the 2D window so this done we can work on the other garments so next I will do the F main outfit uh optimize so the female one uh is correct yeah bring it in add turn off render properties same procedure as before here it is I will move my garment in the area where I want to place it just like this same problem as before I cannot move the Avatar anymore so I need to I can delete it because I already have one in uh go to the project folder two avatars and then go to uh fv2 manin bring it in no I don't want to save yes I want to add and if we lucky we are lucky we can open the size and post from the Garment file again you say okay there we go and only after I added it in directly there is the Gizmo if I would click somewhere else the Gizmo would be gone and you cannot get it back so then you have to delete the Avatar and bring it in again so you can see the Gizmo that's how it works so turn my avatar bring her up let's zoom in a little bit wall is in my way and place her again with her foot on the little stand here a little bit up okay turn her again a little bit okay then I take my garment put it here a little bit and then do the same procedure again over laying it over my uh female Avatar as good as possible just like this and then like this you cannot follow it's completely fine you can do it later or you're just watching whatever you want to do okay screw our pants good yes no leg sticking out looks good okay one last time it's a little bit of fiddling around but it just wanted to show like how I prepared this room the other garments will be added automatically so you don't have to do anything um K main outfit optimized the kit we want to add turn up the render properties wait for it to load there it is move my garment in the correct direction delete the Avatar go to my project folder avatars K B1 mannequin don't want to save add it in so okay and in this case don't ask me why maybe because it's the kids Avatar it's not asking for the Post file if I want to keep it so we have to do it a little bit Manu manually which is also okay so we want to turn it put it up check this place it again with the foot on the stand okay I want to also move my garment here to the side 2D window and move my outfit turn it move it up to high back now you can also really good because the the leing are skin tight you can really look for the um location of the of the pants here so if no lag white lag is sticking out anymore that you know that the Garment is in the right position but I think it's a little bit far away from the from the neck here check with the legs yeah looks good okay nothing is sticking out so how do we get his arms in again I will come to his joins this is over here in Avatar display and it's called show Avatar joints you've known this before this is how you can make your own poses kind of um the shortcut is shift X this is what I use turns it on for all avatars by the way then I want to come to his arms here and I always call this little one here the ginger Bradman it's for the symmetry so if you are not hovering with your mouse you can see that the limbs of the gingerbread man are gray that means that it's deactivated so we want to click on it that it's activated and now if I move here you can see see that both arms are moving and now I want to bring in the arms uh so that it works a little bit better I can see that my arm is sticking out here which is not ideal so that must have been a little mistake   I but I think yeah that's fine um deactivate the join shift X and I can quickly move this a little bit further or or we just leave it like it is it's fine for now you know what I mean and you know how to handle it okay so that's basically it now really important before anything happens I want to save the file go to save as project um save it in the project folder save it on the desktop I save it on the desktop I call it showroom project again but this time it's a z project file so clo project file I'm not an obj and save it to my desktop so now I'll wait for it to save okay check for the triangles verticy count we are 233 again already far away from from 1.4 million so last thing we want to do is I prepared this for you already bring in the other garments this is located in the project folder in garments and the file is called all garments all additional garments sorry and I want to drag and drop the project file inside then it will ask me again do you want to add it um I want to say yes I want to add it and I want to turn off the render properties again the senum props I can leave and I can say okay and fingers crossed is everything worked as planned then we don't have to do anything and all the garments are there inside automatically that's a lot of garments shoes sunglasses folded garments um swimware on other avatars and um some hanging garments on The Clothing Rack on the left side and also two chairs and a plant takes a while so these additional garments I optimized before put them all inside the same as I did with the main outfit I didn't do the AO fitting with these but I did the optimization with everywhere the same so it just boiled down to only a a third of the original size for the comp of quality yes but um for this virtual showroom it should be okay is it done no I don't think so we're working hey there we go so then yeah that's okay and because I saved it like this you can see that the sunglasses are here that are by the way also pattern pieces and that I have Frozen so I can move them around here on the uh rack we have the hangers and the single garments or swimwear um and in our Shelf we have shoes where am I here uh shoes fold garments and swimwear um and by the way if you see uh something like strengthened or frozen you've seen like it becomes orange or light blue if you didn't know this you can turn this off without unfreezing or unstrengthened color and then you can hide specific things but I want to say hide all and then if I go back to my my sunglasses you can see that it is frozen but it's not visible so it is the original color okay so far so good every thing is inside the only thing that we need to take care of when we um saved our file as an obj it's uh that it gets rid of all the material settings that we have set before so if I now click on the mirror and if I come to my um property editor you can see that it turned it back to fabric mat so with the mirror you can click on and then we can change it to metal if scroll down you can see that the reflections already set to 10 the intensity to 100 the metalness to 100 uh the roughness I want to actually set down from 10 to five and now we want to do almost the same with the lamp material because the lamps actually I set for the material type to light which is only uh visible in the render um not like the metal but with light so I will set this to light and just leave it like it is that's the only thing that we have to do and now we are basically done we can close the lid so I click on my ceiling and close my room that's good enough and then I want to save my project Again by hitting control s you can also go to file and save so everything is secured I take a while in the meantime I can can look at you okay and you can see here also in the left hand corner in total now with everything added inside that we need we have 531 th000 compared to 1.4 million this is a difference of s like a third of the complete size of it beforehand but we needed to do it separate because if we would have done the separ the optimization in the the in the Big File things would have been super slow so it's better to take things apart piece by piece do the optimization and then bring the optimized Parts uh back together okay now we can concentrate on the rendering part of it so if we come up here and we go to render then our rendering window comes up so so far we don't have to do anything you can click on the image properties and up here um there's a little uh folder icon next to the saving icon that you can click on because I prepared the image properties for you already so it's just here double click on it so it loads it uh so this should actually be 496 uh so this would be the correct setting and I can show you why I did this because if we go to our closet this already taking things uh a little bit earlier and we go to the virtual showroom I just quickly wanted to show you something before we continue um the images that we will add here for the virtual showroom should be 16 by9 in format and and files must be less than 8,000 by 496 pixels and the size of each image of 100 megabytes maximum so this is what I'm U trying to to set up here in um in CL so I went with the highest resolution so that's what I put it in um otherwise nothing has changed we I turned on uh the transparency but this is up to you um and we are um rendering our pgs so we can leave everything as it is um of course you can change uh the size of the images the bigger the better of course but um yeah uh depends on what kind of quality you want to achieve um then we can go to the light settings same thing again I prepared it for you so click on the folder you should be directed to your project folder and inside uh or in my case it directs me here um and there's so far called light properties and the last thing is that we go to our engine or render properties and load in the render properties file here um nothing crazy we have a use GPU uh if you have a Mac then this is not possible because it doesn't have a dedicated graphics card or depending on which Mac but normally um for Windows you can choose your external GPU um and I put this to CPU supporting so it's the fastest it could get uh a little tip here with the noise threshold is um when I tried this out yesterday um the point uh 0 to Z um setting was a little bit too high so it would uh need to be maybe 010 or um 005 even because the the um the the rendering still got a little bit of grain um in it which was visible and not so nice so um what I saved here is maybe not so good so it would be better if you change this to 0.010 or something um so yeah that was basically it uh for this settings and now comes the most important part and that is to set the camera because what we need to achieve you can see it here already is oh yeah okay I did it here before but we need to create a 360 render as you can see um and now this is possible in CL and I can show you how you go to the camera properties and you can change the lens type here from default to Panorama so this is the most crucial step for this you change this to Panorama you can see that the 3D window is changing so the view is a little bit different now everything shows wired uh I don't know why but it's fine you can come to your um settings here on the left hand side and just put this back to textured surface and you can see it as normal before so what we are now trying to do is we need to find this spot kind of where we are standing on so like the standing position um and there's not really a a rule on where you should do this but you can try this out a little bit so I hope this works and you can still see what I'm doing and it's not stuttering so much now I will just quickly start the uh Interactive you don't have to do this just you can just watch me maybe that's better and I show you what's going on now what for this sake I just to show you I will just lower the image size so the interactive render is a little bit faster takes a while but it should be a little bit faster than the 8,000 by 4,000 resolution sorry accidentally hit my my um space bar can you see something there something happening should almost be there the problem is that I'm turning on the render and streaming or like sharing the screen at the same time and is normally quite heavy for computers um so yeah now you can see what's happening here so it's bending the image around you kind of 360 um so it is a little bit difficult to point out like where am I standing so it's it's a little bit hard what I always do is I turn on this um this grid so I can see like kind of the um um the position of the the image and so on so I will just find a spot where like my KN standing in this room would be that's not a not a general rule so maybe you should um try it out uh a little bit but we can see here that um our lamps are glowing I put some lamps in here that are shining into the scene we have the outside View and so on so I will not render this right now I just wanted to you um to see what's going on but I prepared these renders for you so I took one from this position and then I went to to this side turned around zoomed out a little bit and then took another rendering from this side so I'm stand these are like the standing position where you want to be positioned in the room later and then we can when we now prepare the room after this we can say like we can put in a navigation points and if you click on the points then we get to these positions in the room so the more positions you have so you need for one position One 360 rendering so if you want to be closer to the Shelf then you I don't know need you position yourself here uh so you can then turn around H I think you get my point okay so I will close the render here and I will also close my project just to speed things up and now comes the last part of it so I created the renderings already can show you here in the folder project folder it's in the folder called renderings so I did exactly what I just explained to you so I rendered out um two positions here here actually I didn't set the mirror to roughness five but roughness 10 so it looks a little bit uh blurred um so one this position and then from the other side of the room and now we want to put this together in closet so next step is that we are here in closet this is my uh closet account and I have uh one uh workroom and here in the work room actually what I did is I uh used all the garments the single garments here the project fires and just dragged and dropped this inside of my work room hopefully you have a closet account otherwise um yeah you can log in but if not you can also just watch and then rewatch as I said before so here are all the single garments inside and what I want to do from here is I want to come over here and come to my assortment rooms um yeah so for this I created an assortment room and I called it a virtual showroom demo so here's already one item inside so everything that we want to use later as media in the room we need to put here so if I go back to my work room here's everything that I downloaded or uploaded so sorry click here up here I say select all and then here it said assortment I will open up my Daniel brand from the Daniel company and I will add this to my virtual showroom demo and then I will say next uh and set successful then I go back to my assortment room virtual showroom and now all all the things that I want to add in my scene later um or link to my scene I have to say um are now added to my assortment room and in my assortment room here on the top it says virtual showroom this is the way you can access the show virtual showroom I will click on it and I will say add it and this is then uh where it took me because I added this already normally you have like some default uh um rooms here that you can uh choose from that have been added there just to demonstrate how it's working so I will I can well it's raining like crazy here today um so basically you click on ADD space then either you click choose file or you can drag and drop this in um so you go to your project folder renderings and I will do this now only with the first image because the second one is already inside you have to do both now it's here and the files are also uh 8,000 by 10,000 here if I highlight it you can see the image is 75 megabytes big so less than 100 which is perfect and when I have added my two renderings and I can say okay and now I can see them here I can go it's bit of loading so one image and the other image and now I can customize this virtual showroom a little bit more so I can connect different things to my showroom that I or to my rendering I have to say right um if it's not fitting like from the position you're too too low and you are um yeah then you have to probably do the render again um so it fits or you want to add more positions or yeah um so now I want to click here on the plus sign add content and what I want to add to this rendering is a navigation point click on it this comes up and I will name this um s side and now it ask me to select the space and I will select the first one so like in this position that I uploaded here and here you can um change the color of the of the um Arrow here and also I want to have it like this and then here on the screen you can move this Arrow around can change the opacity and so on but I wanted to be visible so I will just place it here and if this is then done then I can say save so now I need to add this also to the other side because if I'm standing here of course I want to be navigated to this side so I will do the same thing again navigation uh I will uh name this mirror site now select the other space that I uploaded okay change the arrow again move it a little bit here next to my changing room and then I would say save okay um be sure that you when you do uh changes to this virtual showroom that you save it let me just quickly do this successfully saved okay and if I want to test this out I can go to preview and this now shows me um the showroom that I uh created here and say start now you can see my navigation point here on the floor if I click on it it loads and loads the other space um and now I'm on the other side so you can set this up now with multiple views from multiple angles in the room and so on so hopefully uh yeah you know now how this works but you cannot only add navigation points but let me go to the other side here and show you as an example what to do with the stuff that we added to the assortment room because we also can add 3D content and 2D content to this scene so I will click on um 3D content and now from the stuff that I added to assortment rooms I can drag and drop for example the swimware outfit here and it adds a point that I can again move around so when I preview this again start I have to go to the other position here and now I click on this point it brings me directly to the closet um 3D viewer I can uh move around here with my right uh Mouse button clicked and if I then um I can normally I don't know if maybe it's not working in the preview but normally then you can you can click on the project and it brings you to the um closet project for this single file um and yeah people can then view this in a 3D viewer this um content um so yeah this is basically what you can do you can add also other content it's a lot of stuff um that you can upload here that you maybe want to share as well um you can share you can put in a link you can name it you can change the color you can say what it is the size of it um 2D content I said already like an image or something like this or yeah uh probably nice if you um search for this a little bit for yourself and find out like what the possibilities are here you can see a Content page and so on um yeah this is basically it from start to finish I need to shorten the process a little bit of course um so everything uh is speeded up I already surpassed uh the 4M Mark I know we're 10 minutes um but yeah hopefully you learned a lot and I will now see in the chat what is going on I'll just quick stop sharing and yeah let me know if you have questions maybe maybe uh my colleague zimon here that is also in the chat can pick out some questions maybe that are interesting how many hours do you estimate made this took you to create um seeon was laughing um so um creating the room of course it took me a little bit longer because I came up with it by myself like I was searching searching for inspiration pictures before and then searching for textures and like it's a little bit of a back and forth process but if you directly know like I want to build this store and I need this and this then um of course this is a little bit easier so the room was one thing and then it was I wanted to fill it with a lot of garments so it actually looks like a an actual clothing store like a surf shop um and this then for me it was like more ideas like a should I add like a surfboard should I add this and like do I need like I don't know candles and plates or like pictures on the wall and stuff so um the shout out and Eric the recording is to you automatically um at the end of the session um the rooms ah sorry I didn't uh end the question um or the answer um in total I think if I count like actual working hours without any side projects I think it took me like one two weeks um this will h on his laptop yeah uh rooms are not available yet but it's a good idea let's see like so far not so many people have used this virtual showroom because they didn't know how that's why we created the skill up hopefully now it is and like if the if the request for these rooms is like super big maybe we can also forward it internally that we create rooms that you can like bases or something that you can like build on top of um so far you have to do it yourself uh is there skill up demo for creating the showroom um no not yet but I mean you have you have my files I shared everything with you so you can also take the room and like use it for something else um you're free to use it it's a it's my gift to you um what else for the others there's another virtual showroom closet seminar you can also post the link here there is um possibly you can also have a look at our um let me quickly share my screen again just like this on our YouTube channel I think if you put in Virtual showroom yeah there is also another that uh is described by our colleague um uh Jim that uh also goes through how to add content um wait I can also post the link in the chat if you want to have a look just like this and also there's another dedicated video to the everywhere plugin if you are uh into this and you're working on the um more gaming related side um okay this is the everyone one but um yeah okay can we import rooms from 3D files website yes you can Al do that um I also did this before like if I don't have time to build something or I need something complicated a wheelchair or a I don't know a car or something or a phone or something of course you can uh find uh marketplaces that are specialized in like 3D assets and you can bring them into clo that's no problem at all and then also like the same procedure as I did here with like objs for example or at um then you can add the garments in later that come from CL um do you use any additional software to enhance the quality of the image in this case I didn't um you have of course possibilities to um use the AI Avatar studio in clo that is still quite new you can use any enhancement sites like ka. for example let me write it down here for you um that's an an AI uh image enhancement website that you can use but there's also there's so much stuff outside a lot of with AI nowadays as well um you can also take the whole project out export it again as an fpx or something render it I don't know in Unreal Engine you can render it in blender you and yeah do whatever you want it's all possible do you think these digital showrooms will be available to be accessed by Apple VR glasses that's an interesting question I would love to try this out unfortunately we don't have any glasses in the office or not that I know of or in the office this worldwide but um I think uh that's um it's a bit difficult question because I think it was spatial videos um yeah but okay spa videos is something else than 3D files I don't know I haven't tried it out I would love to um can you use the function select Avatar and garment to move things around I believe is what you mean um I think it's not possible because the Gizmo is not coming up uh but we know this and it's a feature request and we're working on it this was an amazing session thank you so much inspirational yeah um is it possible to create virtual showrooms for free uh good question um there you are able to create a free closet account you need a closet account um to create this virtual showrooms um you can upload stuff I but I think it's a little bit limited to a certain point but uh better check it yourself it's uh CL set.com and somewhere should be like the pricing options um yeah exactly already ented yeah okay thank you so much quite interesting to talk with the chat without hearing anyone I hope you learned a lot and you can watch this recording again um sorry if I couldn't answer every question that you had I was focused on presenting um but hopefully zimon um answered a lot of uh your questions okay thank you so much guys working on the next one see you soon take care bye-bye ",
        "Summary": "## Comprehensive Guide to Creating a Virtual Showroom Using CL and the Everywhere Plugin ### Introduction This guide is based on a skill-up session led by Daniel, a 3D design and implementation specialist at CL in Munich. This guide encompasses step-by-step instructions, definitions, tips, and tricks for creating a virtual showroom using CL and the Everywhere plugin. ### Prerequisites 1. **Software**: Ensure you have CL (CLO 3D) installed. 2. **Everywhere Plugin**: Download the Everywhere plugin from the CL website. Registration may be required. 3. **Project Folder**: Download the shared project folder containing necessary assets, including avatars, garments, and optimized files. ### Step-by-Step Instructions #### 1. **Setting Up the Environment** - **Open the Project Folder**: Navigate to the project folder on your local drive. - **Review Folder Contents**: Familiarize yourself with the contents: - **Avatars**: Pre-prepared avatar models. - **Garments**: Clothing assets ready for use. - **Renderings**: Pre-rendered images of the showroom. #### 2. **Screen Sharing** - If using a video conferencing tool, share your screen to demonstrate the process to others. #### 3. **Performance Settings** - Go to **Settings > Display Environment**. - Enable **Show Frame Rate** to monitor performance metrics, including: - **Triangles**: Number of triangles in the scene. - **Vertices**: Number of vertices. - **Patterns**: Number of patterns used. - **CPU Cores**: Cores being utilized by your computer. #### 4. **Optimizing the Showroom** - **Open the Showroom Project**: Open the \"showroom optimized\" project file. - **Check Initial Statistics**: Ensure the project is optimized to reduce the initial triangle count (originally 1.4 million). - **Optimize Walls and Furniture**: - Change the **Particle Distance** for flat surfaces (e.g., walls) to a higher value (e.g., 500) to reduce the model complexity while maintaining visual quality. - Convert mesh types from triangles to quads for flat surfaces when applicable. - **Export as OBJ**: - Export the optimized room as an OBJ file by selecting the room components (excluding the ceiling) and saving it in the designated folder. - Repeat this step for the ceiling. #### 5. **Importing Garments** - Open the garment files and optimize them using the Everywhere plugin: - Set a target triangle count (e.g., 100,000). - Click **Optimize** to adjust the garment’s geometry. - Save the optimized garment files. #### 6. **Auto Fitting on Different Avatars** - Load avatars (male, female, kids) into the project. - Use the **Auto Fitting** tool to fit garments to each avatar dynamically. - Adjust avatar poses as needed, ensuring they are in an A or T pose for better fitting. #### 7. **Assembling the Showroom** - Create a new project and import the showroom OBJ files (room and ceiling). - Place garments on avatars using the Gizmo for positioning. - Repeat for each optimized garment. #### 8. **Rendering Preparation** - Set up rendering properties: - Define image properties (size, format). - Load light properties and render settings. - Change the camera lens type to **Panorama** for 360-degree rendering views. #### 9. **Rendering the Showroom** - Perform 360-degree renders from various positions to capture the showroom environment. - Save rendered images for future use. #### 10. **Creating a Virtual Showroom in CLO** - Navigate to the CLO Connect platform and log into your account. - Create an assortment room and upload rendered images. - Add navigation points linking to different views in the showroom. - Test the navigation functionality to ensure seamless transitions between views. ### Definitions - **Triangles**: Basic units of 3D models, formed by connecting three vertices. - **Vertices**: Points in 3D space that define the shape of a model. - **Particle Distance**: The density of mesh resolution; a higher value indicates lower detail. - **OBJ**: A file format for 3D models that can be exported and imported across different software. ### Tips and Tricks - **Optimize Early**: Regularly check and optimize your models to ensure smooth performance. - **Use Quads for Flat Surfaces**: Quads can reduce complexity for flat geometries while retaining quality. - **Save Frequently**: Always save your progress to avoid losing work. - **Experiment with Camera Angles**: Different angles can dramatically improve the visual appeal of your showroom. - **Utilize the Everywhere Plugin**: This tool can save time in optimizing and rigging garments. ### Conclusion This guide outlines the process of creating a virtual showroom using CL and the Everywhere plugin. By following these steps, you can effectively set up, optimize, and render a high-quality virtual showroom tailored to your design needs."

        "Transcript": "hi everyone my name is Ariel and I'm a CL 3D designer here in the New York City office in today's tutorial we're going to go over how to use morph Target to take a garment from one state to another as well as how to turn that into a handy little turntable to start I really just need to open up any file I've already completed in CL in this case I'm opening up a Blazer uh that I used from CL this is actually a Blazer available in the CL connect store so if any of you are interested you can head on over there to go and get it once we have our Blazer we can see here I have my 3D window as well as my 2D window with my patterns we need to save this out as an obj or object file to do this let me go ahead and select all those pattern pieces go to file export obj selected what we get first is where on our computer we want to start uh save these I actually already have them saved but in this case I'll just save an extra as demo Zone uh usually what I do when I'm saving these is I save the names as the states that they are so in this case this would be demo sewn and we'll have our exploded view as well uh I would click on Save and we're going to get a popup asking how do we want to save this selected patterns select all graphics and trims in my case you know I have a little button trim so I want to make sure that comes with uh make sure we are in thick for our textured surface as well as sa with absolute textures now that the that is done I can click okay and K is going to save out this garment as an obj once K is finished saving this item I can open up or get ready for my garment in a second state when I decide what second state I want my garment to be in I'll usually do a file save as so I'm going to kind of do an exploded view so if I go to file save as project Blazer aart view you can again save it as any name convention that works for you you I just like to make sure that I have my original Blazer State as well in case I ever do need to go back to it once I have this saved I can then start to actually reset my pattern pieces in any way that I want them to morph back into this garment that could be anything from the Garment just being on the floor it could be me selecting my pattern pieces and simply resetting them to their 2D State I could select all those pattern pieces and reset them to their 3D State that's a little bit of a funny state I could use the Avatar's Arrangement points to set them up in this case I've already preset up my second state and again what's nice is I can simply drag and drop to open up this file in the clo 3D window let CL load and open that one up for us and now I can see again it's the exact same pattern pieces in 2D and 3D but in this case all my pattern pieces have used that exploded view I can see interior lining and lapel pieces I can can even see the shoulder pieces here on both sides so I can see all the different pattern pieces that actually Encompass and make up this garment and again you could do any state that you your creativity lets you think about and make in this case again all I want to do is now save this as that obj state so selecting all of my pattern pieces going to file export again obj selected this would be a uh demo aart start and I'll click save I'm going to use once the popup starts going to use the exact same settings that I've already set so selecting all my pattern pieces selected graphics and trims if you have them multiple objects making sure that this is set to thick and again save with absolute textures and click okay CL is again going to go through and save that file for me so I now have my garment saved in both a sewn State obj and a kind of exploded apart view State now next what I do need is just a clean working space to start the animation process going up to file new project and again just a nice clean working State and in fact I don't even need my 2D window anymore so I can go ahead to that bottom right hand corner and click on 3D again it's all about screen real estate I only really need to see what I need to see and I'm going to start with whichever of these states I want my garment to start in in that case for this one I actually wanted to start in that apart view so I can come over to my linked folder again you can always link folders using this ad button to link files directly from your computer cloud share drive whatever you may have and I'm going to go and click on that obj double click open Avatar hit okay and that state is going to open up actually I just realized I opened up my zone one by accident but you know what's nice is in CL we can always go back and start again it's really never the end of the world remember guys in real life life it is all about the measuring twice cutting once but nice and close is you don't necessarily have to do that so I'm going to go ahead and actually delete this file and I'm going to open up the correct one which is the obj apart again open and Avatar sorry about that guys but again we're all human and it's really nice about clothes we can always fix it all right so CL is opening up this so again this is going to be more of an obj everything is attached they are visually individual pattern pieces but again it is all linked together as one solid object perfect I can even tell if I double click it selects everything right there all right so now I have my obj here for myself and what I really want to do now is do this morph Target process and in order to do the morph Target process I'll see I have my obj of my other version in this case it is the sewn Blazer and instead of double click clicking to add it I'm going to rightclick and choose add to workspace the only difference here from anything we've done before is object type I'm going to change it from Avatar to morph Target because we want clo to actually morph it from one to the other when I select morph and click okay again CL is going to load this in it's kind of calculating the animation process of it getting from one state to the next state which is actually pretty cool when you think about it and then we're going to actually be the jump streight into our animation and see that it is already there for us so my Garin just kind of popped itself back together in that second saved state but if I come up to the upper right hand corner and come from simulation to animation we can actually see here we have a little animation bar I'm going to go back to our beginning or go to start and now when I click play you can actually see we have the recorded animation of the Garment going from one state to another state which is really cool and really fun what we can start to think about doing this is adding in maybe some cool camera motions and things to really bring this to life before we render it uh in order to do that I'm going to go back to our beginning and going to use adding key frames so key frames were added in the seven version of clove and are really great to use to add in animations and more to your videos and Creations I'm going to start by adding in a key frame and if I zoom out and click on our key frame there we go we can actually start to see our camera motions oh let's actually go ahead and open up our camera viewfinder so we can actually see our camera we see what our camera sees and you could even turn on the path if you feel that you need that as well just to start again we have our camera position our Focus Point here and this line of sight what I want to do here is take our animation and actually rotate the camera completely around the Avatar while it is morphing itself together starting with our first state and actually creating this rotation is going to be really easy I'm going to go from our current frame of zero all the way to our end frame of 30 again it just kind of snaps close and all I want to do is change our rotation from 0 to 360° and if I come back to the beginning and if you watch this camera here and click play you can actually watch that the camera will now angle itself all the way around the Garment as it morphs together and come back in a 360° motion so it's really simple if you come to your camera group all you need to change is that rotation Y and from there you're ready to go into your render Engine add any lighting and other fun effects and render it out for a final video and just in case you're curious I have it actually already made here for us if we want to see I can go ahead and open this let's go ahead and open it properly and I can hit play and actually see a fun finished video I really hope that everybody here enjoyed this video don't forget to like And subscribe and leave any questions or comments that you might have we hope to see you in the future and happy clo bye   ",
        "Summary": "# Comprehensive Guide to Using Morph Targets in Clo 3D In this guide, we will walk step-by-step through the process of using morph targets in Clo 3D to animate a garment from one state to another, as well as creating a turntable animation for visualization. ## Table of Contents 1. **Definitions** 2. **Preparation** - Opening a File - Saving as OBJ 3. **Creating Second State** - Saving a New Project - Setting Up the Second State 4. **Exporting OBJ Files** 5. **Setting Up a New Project for Animation** 6. **Adding Morph Target** 7. **Creating Animation** - Adding Keyframes - Camera Motion 8. **Rendering the Animation** 9. **Tips and Tricks** 10. **Conclusion and Additional Resources** --- ## 1. Definitions - **Morph Target**: A method used in 3D modeling to transition between different shapes or states of an object. - **OBJ File**: A standard 3D file format that contains geometry data. - **Keyframe**: A frame that defines the starting and ending points of any smooth transition in animation. ## 2. Preparation ### Opening a File 1. **Launch Clo 3D**. 2. Open an existing garment file (e.g., Blazer) from the CL Connect Store. ### Saving as OBJ 1. Select all pattern pieces in your garment. 2. Go to **File > Export > OBJ Selected**. 3. Choose a save location on your computer. 4. Name the file appropriately, e.g., `demo_sewn`. 5. In the export dialog: - Select **All Graphics and Trims**. - Set **Texture Surface** to **Thick**. - Ensure **Absolute Textures** is selected. 6. Click **OK** to save. ## 3. Creating Second State ### Saving a New Project 1. Use **File > Save As** to create a new project. 2. Name it, e.g., `Blazer_exploded_view`. ### Setting Up the Second State 1. Modify your pattern pieces to represent the second state (e.g., exploded view). 2. Save this new state as another OBJ file using the same steps as before, naming it appropriately (e.g., `demo_exploded`). ## 4. Exporting OBJ Files Repeat the OBJ export process for the new state: 1. Select all pattern pieces. 2. Go to **File > Export > OBJ Selected**. 3. Save with the desired settings as mentioned previously. ## 5. Setting Up a New Project for Animation 1. Go to **File > New Project** to start fresh. 2. Hide the 2D window for a cleaner workspace by clicking the 3D icon at the bottom right. ## 6. Adding Morph Target 1. Go to your linked folder in the interface. 2. **Right-click** and choose **Add to Workspace** (for the sewn state OBJ). 3. Change **Object Type** from Avatar to **Morph Target**. 4. Click **OK** to load the morph target. ## 7. Creating Animation ### Adding Keyframes 1. Switch to the **Animation** tab in the upper right corner. 2. Select the **Keyframe** tool. 3. Set the first keyframe at frame 0 (initial state). 4. Move to frame 30, and change the morph target to represent the second state. ### Camera Motion 1. Open the **Camera Viewfinder** to visualize camera settings. 2. Set the camera's rotation from 0 to 360 degrees over the 30 frames. 3. Play the animation to see the morphing garment with camera rotation. ## 8. Rendering the Animation 1. After finalizing animations and camera movements, go to the render settings. 2. Adjust lighting and effects. 3. Render the animation for final output. ## 9. Tips and Tricks - **Naming Convention**: Consistently name your files to keep track of different states. - **Backup**: Always save original states to revert if needed. - **Experiment**: Try different camera angles and speeds for more dynamic animations. - **Use Keyframes Sparingly**: Too many keyframes can complicate the animation; only use where necessary. ## 10. Conclusion and Additional Resources By following these steps, you should be able to create smooth animations transitioning between different states of a garment in Clo 3D. For further learning, consider exploring Clo 3D's official tutorials and community forums for tips and troubleshooting. ### Happy Designing!
