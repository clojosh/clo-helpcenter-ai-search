        "Summary": "# Comprehensive Guide to Improving Digital Fashion Design This guide outlines three effective tips for enhancing the realism and visual appeal of digital fashion designs. By following these step-by-step instructions, definitions, and additional tips, you can elevate your garment simulations and create more engaging designs. ## Tip 1: Increase Thickness Rendering ### Step-by-Step Instructions: 1. **Open Property Editor**: Launch your digital fashion software and navigate to the Property Editor where garment settings are adjusted. 2. **Increase Thickness**: Find the thickness rendering option within the Property Editor. - Set the thickness to a higher value to avoid a flat appearance in your garment. 3. **Select Thick Texture**: - Head to the 3D window of your software. - Ensure that the thick texture option is selected. This will provide depth to your fabrics. ### Definitions: - **Thickness Rendering**: The simulation parameter that determines how thick the garment appears in the 3D space. Increasing this value gives the fabric a more realistic appearance. - **Thick Texture**: A texture setting that simulates the visual characteristics of thicker materials, adding depth and realism. ### Tips and Tricks: - Experiment with different thickness values to find what works best for your specific fabric type. - Use reference images of real fabrics to guide your thickness settings. ## Tip 2: Decrease Particle Distance ### Step-by-Step Instructions: 1. **Locate Particle Distance Setting**: In the software, find the particle distance setting, which controls the resolution of the fabric simulation. 2. **Adjust Settings**: - For animations, set the particle distance to **8**. - For static renders, set it to **5**. 3. **Simulate**: - After adjusting the particle distance, execute the simulation by clicking the 'Simulate' button. - Always perform this step last in your workflow to avoid slowing down your computer during earlier processes. ### Definitions: - **Particle Distance**: A measure of the distance between points in the fabric simulation. Smaller distances result in higher resolution simulations, producing more detailed and realistic fabric movements. ### Tips and Tricks: - Keep an eye on your computer‚Äôs performance; lower particle distances can significantly increase simulation time and resource usage. - If you experience lag, consider increasing particle distance slightly and then simulating again. ## Tip 3: Utilize Color Theory ### Step-by-Step Instructions: 1. **Learn Basic Color Theory**: Familiarize yourself with color theory principles, such as complementary colors, analogous colors, and the color wheel. 2. **Select Color Combinations**: - Use color palettes to select combinations that complement each other. - Tools like Adobe Color or other color palette generators can assist in creating appealing combinations. 3. **Apply Colors to Designs**: - Incorporate your chosen color combinations into your garment designs. - Test different combinations to see which ones enhance the visual appeal of your design. ### Definitions: - **Color Theory**: A set of guidelines that explains how colors interact and how they can be combined effectively to create visual harmony. - **Complementary Colors**: Colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel, which create a striking contrast when used together. ### Tips and Tricks: - Consider the mood and message you want your design to convey; different colors can evoke different emotions. - Don't be afraid to experiment with unconventional color combinations for unique results. ## Conclusion By implementing these three tips‚Äîenhancing thickness rendering, decreasing particle distance, and utilizing color theory‚Äîyou can significantly improve the realism and aesthetics of your digital fashion designs. ### Call to Action Let us know in the comments if you found these tips useful or if you have your own top tip to share. Engaging with the community can provide further insights and inspiration!"

project to have the exact same lighting setup over here we have some presets that are natively available within clo I'm going to select a random one it can be this one and you'll see all the lights that are included in this preset will be over here I don't want it so I'm going to press reset and you notice that on the right side of each light name you have the ability to activate them show them in 3D and show them in the render the lighting preset we have right now consists of an HDR image that's in the environment map and we are able to change its intensity by manually inputting a specific value or using the slider you can also adjust the light angle and we can additionally lock to camera which will pretty much it's as if the light would be attached to the camera so the light will always follow the camera movement it won't be static in the rendering scene as you can see over here if I turn it around the light stays in the same place always hitting on the right side additionally we have the ground Shadow which if you want to activate you would have to press this icon to show in the render where you can manually input the the specific value for intensity or just use the slider this is not what I want so to go back to default I will once again press on reset and we're back to our studio low contrast default in CL we have six different types of light we have rectangle lights whose size intensity Direction and color can be changed these are usually characterized by their soft Shadows sphere light a globe-shaped light whose size intensity and color can be changed and its effect it's similar to a light bulb in a frosted glass glob directional light which is a small light whose size a static but intensity and color can be changed these are characterized by their sharp Shadows Spotlight which is a cone shaped light whose size intensity Direction and color can be changed the cone penumbra angle and Shadow radius can be changed to add effect to the environment allowing you to make the shadows and Edge of the light a pure Mar are soft or sharp IES light that have an IES file describing how light from a lamp is distributed in a room this data is usually provided by lighting manufacturers so that lighting designers can realistically simulate how a project will look when a specific light source is used and lastly dome light the default in CL is Studio low contrast these include an environment map image that can be shown to create an visual environment CL includes already some presets but third party hdri files can also be used it's pretty much an image file with light information that wraps around in a 360 angle around the entire environment I will start by deactivating our dome light so that we can see what we're doing and add a rectangular light by clicking on it you'll see that the light was added in our 3D window we can move it around and rotate to make sure the light is actually shining at our Avatar you're also able to deactivate it show them in the 3D window and show in the render you're able to change its intensity and also its color I'm going to choose this pink one or you can also use the RGB slider you can also manually input dimensions for the light size and you'll see as soon as I press press enter the changes are reflected on our 2D and render window because I have the light set to be shown on both windows in 3D and on the render window I'll be clicking on it and hit the backspace to delete it and now let's add a skere light you'll see that the light was added right at the bottom of our 3D window and now I'm just going to bring it up a little and towards the front I'll leave this in the middle to show you something else later you can see that we have a small line coming from the sphere that's the direction of the light but since this is a sphere light and gives the same effect as light coming from a frosted light bulb the light is evenly distributed around the sphere so in all directions so for this light in particular this line is just purely illustra as you can see you're also able to deactivate them show them in 3D and show them in the render you're able to change its intensity as well its color and also its radius I'm going to select it and hit the back space to delete it and let's now add a directional light by clicking on it you'll see that once again it was added at the bottom of our scene I'm going to push it forward a little and a bit up you can see that this light has some really sharp Shadows if you pay attention to the shadow casted by his head I'm going to slightly rotate this light and you see that the shadow will move but will still be extremely   sharp you can also deactivate them show them in 3D change its intensity and of course also change its color I'm going to click on it again hit the back space to delete it and let's now add a spotlight by clicking on it once again the light was added at the bottom of our 3D window and I'm going to leave it here at the front to show you how different settings affect the light I'm just going to zoom in a little and of course you also have the ability to deactivate the light and show it in the 3D window you can change its intensity its color and you can change its cone angle which will pretty much dictate how broad the light source will be as you can see the bigger the angle the broader the light is the pum angle is related to the edges of the light you'll notice if I set the penumbra angle to 10 the light edge will be much softer rather than if it's set to zero so the bigger the value the softer the light edge will be the same goes for the shadow radius if I increase it a little you'll notice that his chin Shadow will be slightly softer it's the exact same principle the higher the value the softer the shad I'm going to click on it and delete by hitting the backspace next let's add an IES light by clicking on it and of course you have the option to activate the light show and hide in the 3D window and like I previously explained the I light consists of an IES file to change this file you can just press on this four squares icon right here and browse through your computer to find your IES file press open and it was added the the intensity of this light will be given in lumens it will be characteristic of each light map meaning it will be characteristic of each IES file Additionally you can also change this to custom and input your own specific value the higher the value the higher the lumens the higher the brightness and of course you're also able to change its color I'm going to click on it and hit back space to delete and let's go over to our last Light which is the d light if I click on it I'll get a pop-up window saying that the current scene already has a dome light that is because in the beginning of the video I just deactivated our dome light because in CL the dome light is the default light when you open up the render window so I'm just going to press okay and go to our light properties I'll just click on it and you'll see over here we have a dome light already added it was just deactivated I can reactivate it by pressing This little light bulb icon and of course I can also show it in 3D and in the render I'm able to change light intensity and the light angle you'll notice as I slide it the light will change direction so it will be rotating around our Avatar additionally I can lock into camera which means that the light will follow the exact same movement the camera is doing if I turn it off you'll notice that now the color will be static and it will be always shining at the avatar from the same direction this environment map is the studio low contrast which is the default in Clow and to change it to another HD image I just have to press this little plus icon navigate through my computer and open the HRI file I want to use in this case I also wanted to show in the render so I'm going to press this icon and we can see our hdri image also in the render I'm going to change the angle to zero so that we get a nice background and you'll see the hdri image totally wraps around our scene if I lock to camera and now rotate you'll notice that the hdri image stays in in the exact same place but the Avatar still rotates around it so right now this hdri image that we loaded onto our environment map is the only light source being used to create this render if I click over here you'll be able to see some maps that belong to our Clow presets like I said in the beginning of the video all lighting information will be stored over here in the light properties so if I now change to this Limelight preset you'll see that this preset is made out of a bunch of different lights if I click here to show them all in our 3D window you'll be able to see the lighting layout of course I can click and move them around just like a normal light and if I click on it I'll get just properties related to that light in specific to get an overview again I would have to go back to light properties and there I would have the information regarding to all the lights I can do the exact same things I can change the intensity of the light I can do the exact same things as if I clicked on them in the individually to add another one for example a sphere light I would just have to click on it and a new sphere light was added if I go onto our light properties now and scroll all the way to the bottom you'll see that our newly added sphere light was added over here right at the bottom I'll just increase ins intensity a little bit for you to see that it's actually there and to this I just have to click on it and hit the backspace or delete key if I want to save this exact lighting settings to use on a different project I would just have to go over here click on Save navigate through the folder I want to save it in give it a name and press save so I'll press reset to simulate that I'm starting fresh with a completely different project I will now be able to open up the exact same lighting settings so I would go to our light properties once again hit on open and I would just have to locate the file and open it and there you go we have the exact same light settings added to our project I hope this video was informative and that you could learn something today thank you so much for your time and for watching until next   time ",

        "Transcript": "hi my name is Phoebe and I'm going to walk you through all of our great new features in close 7.3 and how this can update and improve your workflows moving forward so let's Jump On In if you have any questions please feel free to ask them in the live chat or if you're watching at this at a later time please post below in the comments one of our great CL 3D designers will get back to you so let's have some fun while we learn in 7.3 we have this really amazing new feature called fabric Creator what this will allow you to do is actually create Fabrics in Clone without needing to scan or create anything it's this really amazing algorithm that our developers have worked up on and created for all of you so where do you find this amazing feature in a few places you can find it in your object browser under Fabrics you can rightclick and you'll see in the drop-down fabric reader or you can go to your fabric your um top menu and there's editor and you can select an editor and then select fabric Creator through there what will happen is when you create editor a new fabric will pop up and you can create something completely new here so here I'm going to type in my new name I'm going to say like new address I can type in supplier and also owner when I hit apply all of this information will then populate into the fabric one in the object browser and you'll also see all that information in the property ad there now after I type in the owner name and supplier I'll then type in the information to create the fabric so all I need to know is the fabric type composition and density and all of that information will then create the fabric up above so you can scroll through here and select one of the Fabrics or you can just start typing in and then you can um select the fabric that way you'll then have a lot of different options for composition what I'm going to do is again you can type in and select kind of your composition or you can like just pick through the menu I'm going with this cotton modal bandex then what you start to do is type in the percentage for each one so make sure that it adds up to 100% that'll even be a little um reminder for you and then you'll see that all of this fabric changes automatically once you type all of that that stuff in you can continue to edit and adjust this so if I want to change around my numbers I can so as you can see here this adjusted as well this will also work for density so here I have 300 density if I change this to 180 it changes as well and it will continuously update automatically for you which is really fun because the automatic adjustments is really great and then it allows you to understand like how this fabric is changing if I select apply you see now here that all of this information is now in my Fabric in the object browser and it's also reflected in the property editor off to the right here you also see that in physical properties it's now saying that it was made in version two while in the original address it was version one so you see now in new address when I select this it's version two and it was created by the fabric reader so this will just help you understand like where all your fabric was creaded also as you can see there's different view options to view in your fabric Creator you have the cylinder this is a square cylinder you can also do a cape if you wanted to see that and you can also play around with different like custom views and stuff or you can have like top 3/4 all of that which is really really great and helpful and you can also customize it and move around just like you can in your 3D window if you want to lock the view you can of course do that as well now that I have my view all set I like my fabric we can then move on to our Maps if you want or you can keep on playing around with your density and see different weight options and stuff for you so here in my maps there's a few options one there's that wand again so if you do have access to it you can automatically generate or you can use some of our clo presets by just clicking on and you have already presets for you this will have your texture maps and normal maps and sometimes even just placement Maps as you can see here when I hit apply you can also bring in your own texture normal Maps dis spacement maps and everything so here I can bring in some my own maps that I have right I can like pick through any of these and you can edit these around as well so I'm going to bring in my normal map too so that this all looks great and I can continue to adjust so just like with my normal Maps I can change the intensity I can adjust the um size same with my texture I can turn on desaturation I can adjust the size of this as well all of this you can do all within here so that you get the fabric that you want and the effects that you want I can then hit apply and then again all of this is then applied if I want to see this in my garment all I would have to do is select the Garment and apply my fabric to that just like everything else and now I have my fabric assigned here I can simulate and see how this will change and adjust what's also really nice about when you make a fabric in the fabric Creator if I ever want to go back I can by just right clicking fabric Creator and then this will keep all of the previous adjustments that I made in fabric Creator it will still open that original fabric up here and I can continue to make any adjustments that I might want so if I was like oh actually I didn't want this desaturated or something or I wanted to change around the visual I could if I also started to see that um this wasn't draping exactly how I wanted it to drape I could maybe say like oh I wonder what a different density would be like if you an expert in understanding fabrics and your knowledge you can adjust your fabric even further with your fabric Creator again this is for experts and really understanding because this will then change the accuracy of your fabric so in your detail option below right here you can actually change out the different properties of your fabric here so and you'll see it adjust in real time so here if I change my stretch warp you'll see how my fabric is now adjusting in the drape in real time you can always reset to the original if you want if you've like adjusted too much or too far or anything like that once they're all set you can then save your fabric if you want to if you want this like saved in your library so here I can save this out and use it in the future or anything like that and I can go into my library now and actually find this fabric by using my search and you'll see all of that here and now I can just apply it really great really great really amazing feature I think so much fun so in 7.3 we release this ability to uh automatically generate textures through AI this is right now still in beta it will be a for a month after the release of 7.3 you can sign up for beta on our website and then what will happen is you'll be able to actually see the icon it's this magic little wand and the first thing that you'll do is you'll get a certain amount of credits each credit will equal like one generated texture and you'll have around like 500 of those after we're done with a beta we'll then release this onto the software for all to use we just wanted to get a lot of feedback and understanding of this feature now let's jump into the feature so where can you find this amazing feature what you can do once you've signed up for it is you can go straight to your Fabric in your object browser and you can select that and then down in the property editors you'll see next to basic parameters the little magic wand and you can select this and that is your AI texture generator if you've already generated some textures like you've seen I've done here you'll actually see your history and and the textures you've generated I can close this history really easily and now I can start to jary so here I have my fabric type you have a certain amount of fabric types you can scroll through look through them or if you have one in mind you can start typing it in and select it I'm going with Jersey now you have content so you can have style for that kind of think of how you have it with illustrator and Photoshop where you could do like cartoon watercolor oil anything like that and then there's also pattern which is like if you wanted a camouflage or Tartan or like a polka dot you could do that I'm going to use style and I'm going to pick like a vintage now you can do pattern size the size dictates like how big the like pattern will be if you do one then it's going to be closer to like a 1024 size if you do all the way up to four then it'll be um each one will generate more closer to like a four a 4,000 which would be like four repeats of 1,000 generated four times once they're all set you'll then put in your text prompt so here I'm going to put in like sunflowers and once I've typed that in I can then just hit generate and then it will show me where I'm in the queue and then generate it for me as you can see I can then see my history I can select one of my previous ones and use this little pin as if to pin this prompt and then generated it again as you see all my fabric type content and pattern size all went with that previous one so it all changed and again now it's going to generate it again and see like oh let's find another one kind of like it just like I did what I also have the option of doing right next to the pin button is this like Dice and this will randomize The Prompt for me so I can select this and it will create a random prompt I can then go in and change my fabric typee if I want or I can keep hitting random to see other options I'll then generate and see how that looks so this feature is really great to give you ideas to create like first print ideas kind of quickly so then you can go in and create more or adjust more so if I make the pattern size bigger again the pattern size is a fixed size but if you want like three that means when I apply it to my garment it will be larger if I did three versus one once I'm all set I can then select any of these patterns that I like and then just hit apply then you'll see that it'll apply onto my garment I can like minimize this window go in with my edit texture tool and adjust the size I can rotate it around or anything like that if I want to if I want to keep generating of course I can go back to my AI generator window and I can maybe find a new print type in something different apply different ones as you saw this one is two and when I apply it the it's bigger on the Garment right so here I'm going to do sunset like let's see what it would look like here here and you can see like this is what a sunset paisley pattern would be but if I wanted to change that to style and say like okay let's do kind of a vintage Sunset then it we'll find an image of the sunset and then do a style of vintage in that image so you can really see how you can really start to really build up a library really quickly um how you can start to really create really fun ideas of different artworks and stuff really fast um and this can be a really great like first round if you want in one of our key features we have this new ability to add linked editing so now you no longer have to always have every pattern symmetrical to make it so that what you do to One automatically applies to the other with this new editing linked editing feature you can select certain lines and Link them together so that what happens to one happens to the other this is going to be great for pockets for facings for so many different things that you can think about so let's dive on in and I can show you a little bit more about this feature here I'm going to go into this pocket and what I'm first going to do is go to my edit pattern tool select one of the lines and then write right click and say link editing I'll hold down shift so that I can select two lines at once kind of like our one to M sewing so you can click one line and then hold down shift and select the others you also can apply linking through our sewing lines so you can select our edit sewing tool select the sewing and then right click and Link the lines through there which is really great now that I have my lines linked whatever I do to either one of these lines will apply to the others so I'm going to change this to um monochrome view to let you see this a little bit easier and here when you select the line you actually see the linking applied and here I can make this larger like make the opening a little bit bigger and as you see when I make this opening bigger the pattern will adjust as well you can adjust the like direction in which your patterns are moving by holding down the D key and this will make it so that when you go up it goes up or um when it goes up it goes down depending on how you want it to move you can just hold down D and then it will switch it around for you I can also then um lengthen this if I want to by selecting the points and then you can see how that will actually lengthen this which is really cool I think and I can do that again for the other points as well well there is something to know right now the Precision boxes don't apply to the linked editing that's because everything's a ratio so it will not change the exact like if one line is 1.5 and the other line is one it will keep that 0.5 diff difference continuously so when you use the Precision boxes that doesn't always work because then it would changed both measurements to that exact precise measurement so that's why the Precision boxes don't work at this moment in time you can always undo if you want to but as you can see what happened to one happen to the other because they are symmetrical which is also really great but I didn't have to have all of the pattern pieces symmetrical to have this Supply so easy and great really helps with a lot of workflows really helps with like speeding up adjustments you can also do this for um creating patterns so here if I wanted to create like a pocket on top I can go in and create this internal shape and maybe like I want a little Point here you know and I can create my shape here and then what I can do is go into my Trace tool right click and now I can trace as pattern with link so here I can just bring out this link and everything will all be linked together and you can see here I have my edit pattern tool but then I also have below that edit linking and what I can do then is select all those links and I can add sewing to it so that I don't have to sew everything in as well I can then of course edit this sewing now and adjust it but let me first see all my linked lines and then I can quickly simulate this onto my pattern like my garment right and now I can start to edit and adjust this so now you see this is a bit big so if I move this down my internal lines already moved down as well so you can see that this works on both pattern outlines and internal lines at the same time which is really great really helpful right like this is a really exciting new feature I think like so great you can continue to go to this edit link so uh tool to unlink FL flip directions or apply sewing as well to apply linked editing again I'll go to the edit pattern tool we kept it in the edit pattern tool so you can do things like this so you can quickly edit your pattern or round and then stay within that same tool and then select and right click link lines you can also use the shortcut of U um the U key to link lines as well and again using se you link lines and again here with this facing what I do to the facing will all will automatically apply to the Shell as well and what I do to the Shell will apply to the facing yeah really great fun tool so in 7.3 we've also updated our connection between CL and close set so as you know on our library you also can switch between connect and closet and what we've done is we've made a few changes to make it so that when you bring things in upload things you view your libraries everything's a little bit improved so let's go to our library here and here I'm going to go to my closeup window and then my connect window so one of our updates here is the icons and everything in thumbnails so originally if you wanted to see all of these thumbnails and stuff you have to download everything now though you can see thumbnails and stuff even if you haven't downloaded another update we've made is to see like the front view and stuff you actually can see the whole thumbnail so it's not just the front view now it's the thumbnail that was saved in which is really really nice so it's a better viewing experience and you can see more of it so here you can see front side and back another update we've made with close set is now we have an all contents folder so before you just could bring in your favorites that you favored it in closet but now you have an all contents option where you will see all of the contents that you have with clap and also when you search if you search something that you do not have in the window you'll see that much easier so see if I search zipper I'll see all my zipper options right but if I type something in that I don't have you'll see very clearly and easily that there's no um search result or anything like that so you'll know right away if something's not there and finally and then finally if you've downloaded something you can actually have it opened immediately so here when you downloaded something then you would have to double click and open it but now if I select this and download it or just bring it in it will automatically download it and then open it which is really great less steps so now you can hide your layer color so you know that bright neon green color to show you which um pattern pieces are on a layer or not that can be hidden so here I can select my pattern pieces and I'm going to put them all certain ones on layer one so all of the like belt loops okay now what I can do in my 3D window to get rid of that bright green color I can rightclick and the option to show hide color I can say hide all or I can say hide layer because now we have that option great right I can also show it back again we have updated our fitting suits in 7.3 and fitting suits are really important because it allows you to take like obj avatars or your own personal avatars and still use the amazing features of Cl on top of them so here I'm going to bring in a fbx avatar here and open this up great so now I have this Avatar and what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to Avatar Avatar editor and there's this new tab now called fitting suit so here what can happen is it will automatically actually create a fitting suit for you just like so or what you can do is you can reset and you can draw the lines in yourself if you don't like how it was made what I'll do is I'll first select the first first line or the second line you can start anywhere you'd like so I might want to start with a waist and then I'll place that here and I'll just continue to go down this line here and create all of the points and areas that I need to make to then create the fitting suit now that they're all drawn in I'll then have my whole fitting suit and then I can select dra fitting suit and it will be then created on top we have updated our ability to import fbx and adjust scales for them so you have to um open it in Kalita then gltf 2.0 and alic files so if you've done it in any of those then you are able to actually adjust the scaling of fbx you'll be able to know because you'll bring in the fbx and when you select it next on the top right there will be the scaling button and you can click on that next to the Gizmo on its top right and then you can start to scale like you see here then you'll be able to adjust and scale this object just as you see pretty easy you also see over in the property editor that there's now the scale local option here and you can actually adjust that here as well and you can have aspect ratio on or off um so you can lock it or you don't have to if you're importing an fbx from that has joints like this one you can also do that by selecting this little dot here and [¬†__¬†] see again off to the top right of the Gizmo you can change to the scaling option and then you can start to scale these in proportion with all of the joints and stuff and again you can adjust with a local scale off to the right in the property editor as well and you can lock the aspect ratio if you want we have updated even further with our fbx because now when you import fbx you have an option on um like the positioning and everything so here you'll see that there's this new axis conversion and you now can actually decide like if you want to invert any of the X Y or Z so you're going to invert Y and you're going to see this really cool thing and now I have them upside down which is kind of fun yeah you are now able to actually export and import multiple fbx files at once so here I'm going to go through export going go to file export fbx and I'm going to say multiple avatars multiple export and now I'll have the option in the popup to export all or I can select which one to export so I'm able to check both off or just one and then I can hit okay now this will make it so that they both export together and I can even now import these fbx together as well so I can do multi- import and I can open hit okay and you'll see now they went right on top of this so for all of you do fans out there now we're working on a better import from dos into Club so now when you import a jaw Avatar you can almost autocon convert that Avatar within close so I'm going to go to Avatar convert to Avatar open up my file and I have a do Avatar that was created within toss obviously and bring this in so here I have this and hit open now what you'll see is co will Now understand that this is from do great and you'll start to see some new things pop up in this menu so first you'll see gender and you'll see DOD 3D Genesis 8 you're also see that you can save different paths so you can do the Avatar shoes and hair and then they can all be saved in different folders as you can see here great you can also open this and change where you want it to be saved too if you want to like change where it is which I'm going to right here and now what you can do is you can then pick like and change out your names too so if you want to change the name here so I'm going to say do Avatar and now I can select the different converting types so I'm going to pick all three so I want I'm going to have three avatars after created and now I'm going to hit convert and then CL is going to work its magic and then start to convert all of these dos avatars into the CL avatars and then even something more special can happen in a minute once all the avatars are done you'll then get those popup converted avatars and then I can open the folder and I'll see them all here great right so once you've converted all of your avatars here I've converted my avatars from that do Avatar and I have a skin editable a rigging editable and a size editable now what I can do is go to my property editor after I select the Avatar and turn on soft body simulation this will work for both my skin editable and my size editable through the conversion Avatar it will not work for for the rigging so as you can see with rigging soft body does not have that checkbox but it does for the size editable and the Skin editable So now all of your own avatars if you convert them can now have soft body applied to them great right so now you can add in soft body to your own Ed avatars and you can now use soft body even in animation so here I have my avatar that I created from Jaws converted using the skin suit and everything and I've turned on soft body and I'm going to now go into animation and as you can see soft body can still be on all I have to do is record and I'll be able to record this through for both soft body and my garment as you'll see soft body and garment will both turn on here and then I'll be able to show you all an amazing soft body video through my animation we've added another fit map to close 7.3 so that now you can see the pressure applied to the Avatar so here I have my garment and I've also have my converted Avatar that I can also apply soft body to but here I'm turning on my stress map and as you can see and then I have my strain map great and I have my FIT map but the new map that's just been created is this pressure map for the Avatar and now what you'll see is how much pressure the Avatar is getting is being placed on through the Garment just know this does not yet work for our soft body so please make sure soft body is off here what I'm going to now do is Select this top part of my garment this corset part and change the shrinkage and go over to my property editor and in shrinkage W I'll lower this percentage once I simulate you'll then see how it's adjusted so I can continue to go back and forth and adjust this around and again I can adjust my WFT and you see how that adjusts and you can see all around how the fit map has now adjusted to the new pressure that the Garment is applying on to it because the Avatar is now gaining a lot more pressure or a lot less when I go up we have heard and we have listened and we have updated registering accessories so here in my window I have my avatar and what I'm going to do is say register accessories make sure that the accessories are registering match the Avatar in which you like made them with so here I'm going to first accept accessory type and we've added some more options I'm going to do the shoes and we've also include more options with shoes so you can do flats or heels or continue to explain expand this I'm going to do flats and one of the updates here with the object again you're added in as normal but you don't just need fbx anymore you can also use obj and a and also Dae once I've brought it in you'll see that it'll automatically show up in your 3D window you can also resize it so here this is very very small so I can play around with a different sizing options now this is very very big and I can keep adjusting it until I get the size that I want and I can also play around with this scale so here great now another great update is I can adjust the position of this and move it around before we weren't really able to adjust all of this stuff now we can great right on another update we've made is like for a shoe if I just made the left I can just mirror create then the right will be made automatically for me another amazing update I know you can continue to move these around separately too so that they match up perfectly and also you can do a thumbnail so it can Auto create a thumbnail or you can do a custom thumb nail either way I'm going to do Auto and then once it's all set I can then just hit save name this and then I'll have it going name it choose because that's important and the accessory has been registered so much easier than before right you also if you've made the accessory and cloth like I just made this shoe and you don't have to like jump around now all the time now all you have to do is and say register accessory say shoes patterns and now what I'm going to do is mirror create and auto see like so crazy easy and amazing I know right we listened we trying it's going to be great you can also do this when you just select all your pattern pieces rightclick and then say convert to Avatar in the 3D window that's another way in which we can approach this either way is going to be perfect we've updated our joints in 7.3 so now when you select your avatar you can actually view the joint so here I'm going to go to my 3D toggle menu and turn on x-ray and now as you can see you'll still be able to see the shirt and your garments and also the Avatar when you're adjusting and moving your joints this will allow you to get a more a better understanding when you're adjusting your shoulders or any joint movements or anything like that because you'll also be able to see the body at the same time a little bit clearer so in the older versions when you added in pins oh M you couldn't always select them easily within the 3D window or 2D window and we've updated did that so here with our pin update here I'll go to my pin box what I can do is I can start to select some pins so here in my 3D window now what might be happening is I don't want to select the pocket I just want to select underneath the pocket so then I'll go into my 2D window and I'll select the other pins that I want with underneath the pocket what used to happen is then you would go into and select but you couldn't move it but now as you can see I have my Gizmo automatically showing in my 3D window so I can select in my 2D and my Giza will stay up so that I can easily then move it in 3D for where I want it to go really great a nice Improvement to make working even easier within class so we've made some updates with our guidelines here I'm going to turn on my ruler and bring in some guidelines like so by just clicking and dragging the update we've made is now you can rightclick and use your Precision boxes to adjust your guideline positions you can go up or down you can use distance moved or anything like that but here using your Precision box you can accurately and precisely move your guidelines to exactly where you want them to in your 2D window we've made some updates here for our darts so one of the new updates we've done is when you're adding a dart so here I'm going to add in a point and then go to my edit pattern tool right click and add Dart and with my shape D cap these are the updates we've made so first I'm going to put in my size and everything great and now with my shape Dart what I can do is add in curve points so that I can make this line a little bit smoother and I can adjust and create a really nice curve that I'm looking for with my new dart so I can add them in I can adjust them and I can change them once I'm all set I can then just hit enter to complete and I'm all good another update we've made with our darts is when you're actually moving them around so here I have this point and before I didn't really have many guideline options and it wouldn't snap to the center but now it's going to snap to Center when I'm holding down shift or when I'm holding down control that top Point can actually snap to the center point or it's going to snap to those um guidelines which which is really really nice to making sure that you follow along with those edges that you want so yeah really fun so we have a really amazing new feature that's like small but it's going to pack a might do punch it's the match up with measurement feature so here I have two lines and before I would like to select this line see what that measurement is then select this line see what that measurement is and then decide like okay I have to memorize these lines and then change it but now what I can just do is Select both lines rightclick match up and match measurements so here I can now decide if I want to match to the shorter or longer measurement I'm going to do longer and I can also decide which direction I want to go so if I want to change it to my start to both Center to both start and and end or just the end I'm going to do start so that the bottom gets longer and you even see the measurement amount that you're changing it to which is really amazing I can then hit okay and then it will update really great feature right so this is really great what we have done is made it so now when you want to create patterns from internal shapes you can easily sew them all so here I have my internal shape as a pocket I'll use my transform pattern tool select it right click and clone as pattern with sewing what I know and now this is all sewn together isn't that amazing I can also do this for like facings not just Pockets this is multiple so here this is Main and and now it's just sewing magically and going onto the shirt like magic and now I could do this for the facing as well so here I have this facing it's a shape again I'll right click clone with sewing and then I hit can hit control D to make a symmetrical copy and everything's sew and again I can now just right click and superimpose under perfect right we have made it so selecting enl is even easier and faster so here before when you would select you would have you could select really easily you could like click hold down have a box or you could click and hold down shift and select others but now what you can do is you can select a pattern rightclick and say select all that are sewn together so then if you have something like this where all of your patterns are kind of really close to each other you can make it so only the patterns that are sewn together are selected so again it's selecting rightclick select all so selecting rightclick select also and then you can organize your window a little bit better if you want and all of that so it'll make it so that you can easily select a bit more in club in some previous releases we updated our sewing tool to actually allow you to adjust seams in their Direction we've gone further with this feature to now allow you to actually link top stitching and puckering while in the edit Zone sewing tool so here I'm going to go to my edit sewing tool and select this sewing line and as you remember in our past release what we now have is the 3D seam line and you can do a plain seam or a directional seam and then you can pick which direction that seam is being folded towards so seam a or seam B the update is now you can turn on top Stitch and Link the top stitches that you have in your object browser to this as well so I can go to this dropdown and select any of the top stitches that I have in my object browser and bring them in and as you can see they automatically apply and follow the sewing lines which is really cool right like so easy and simple I'm going to go with this top Stitch here and you also have other options where you could extend like start to end you have your corner options so if you want to curve curved or right angle or anything like that you also can choose your placement for your top Stitch so if you want both on both seams if you just want it on a or if you just want it on B I'm going to go with both now what's really important to know though is if I wanted to edit this top Stitch like change the color or the thickness or anything like that I would need to go to the top stitch in the object browser and adjust it there so if you want to change any colors or if you want to change your thickness or anything like that that all is still done in the object browser you also can then go in and turn on puckering and here you can link your puckering as well so again it's all linked back to the object browser what's ever in there you can also decide like which seams you wanted on seam a seam B and you can also do the default puckering like or like you can change your buck rang from your object browser again if I want to edit my Puck ring I have to go to my object browser and edit it in there so you'll see this a little bit better if I change around like the density or intensity for normal Maps now you'll see like how my puckering is on both sides and all of that which is pretty great and easy so what's really amazing about this is it can really like improve workflows here because what this is doing is now it's linking okay think about this it is linking your top set your puckering and your seaming all together in one so if you know like okay my uh 116 inch turn back seam is always like this I can then save that as the standard right and now I can save it here and hit save that means all of the information of the top switch the puck ring and the seaming is all saved there and it could select all the seams of the same property or I could just select all the seams that I know that would link with that and then I can just hit open and apply all of those seams to this so then it all automatically applies for all the top stitching all the puckering and all the seeming information this also all works with the tech and everything so then all of that info goes into there so it's really going to make it so that you can just quickly and easily apply top stitching and puckering without even having to think about it or you can start saving out presets even faster really improving a lot of workflows I think in clo and making it so that you can really start to standardize which is great look at all that we've also updated our top stitches to be improved a little bit too with visuals so before when you added in top stitches that like had all of these curves and stuff sometimes they wouldn't always go to the edge as cleanly as we would hope but now when I apply them here you're going to see how they go all the way to the edge exactly how we want them to be super easy just like so and it even is going to work when you're using the other sewing tool over seamline so here when I selected here be over the seam line it also works really well as well great right so you all know that you were able to unlink your top stitches in previous versions and you've all been asking to do the same thing for puckering well guess what you wanted it you've got it now with all of our puckering you're able to select the lines rightclick and removed linked editing with your edit linking again it's really easy you can just select the line rightclick unlink editing and then delete it and then you can do the same with all of your top searching too as you've already been able to in past releases select the top stitching right click remove linked editing then delete easy peasy isn't that amazing yeah you're also able to with link pun with Puck ring save out the puck ring style you just made again something similar to top Stitch now you can do it in Puck ring you wanted it you got it so you can select your Puck ring and then at the top in the property editor you can just hit save and then you can save out all of those material properties too pretty great within 7.3 's been some updates with our seam tape so here what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to my seam tape tool and I'm going to apply it to my pattern pretty quickly and easily as you can see and then as you can see here it doesn't all the ways extend to the edge so what I'm going to do is I'm going to now go into my property editor and as you can can see under seam tape there's now the extend so I'm going to check that on and now you'll see that it'll extend all the way to the edge of my pattern as you all know we made a huge update with our elastic in our last release and we've continued to update it in this release as well so with our elastic we've adjusted some of the algorithm to be a little bit more accurate and what we've also done here is we've adjusted it for both your B and the print layout so when I go into my fabric here the elastics I'll see and I'll switch to print layout and what you'll see is that the patterns that are using elastic are not in your print layout elastic also is an in print layout as well because that's not normally how you price and add in elastic it's normally through like rules and everything so we took that out of print layout with our bom you also see that if multiple pattern pieces are using the exact same elastic we will just add in the all of the measurements of that for the quantity and then have it so that it's priced through there so that it is much more accurately priced and everything for you to input it and you can have a more realistic cost for what the Garment will be you've been asking for this for a while now and we now finally have it for you you are now able to close up your edges with piping so here I have some piping and what I can do is I'll select that and now in my property editor over here you'll see that now my finishing I I can close my start and end side I know exciting here I've selected my piping and you'll see that the finishing is not closed and if I want to turn that on to close it all I have to do is Select this just like here and I can turn this on and then it will close it and you can kind of see at the tip like the top of this when I do on it starts closing up now looks a little like Wiggly and off but don't worry once I hit simulate CL will fix that up for you perfectly nice and perfect right do know that if your particle distance is low for your like the pattern pieces that the piping is put on it will always look better so make sure that your particle distances are low and that will always improve you can always uncheck it if you want to and then it will open it up again just like so so we've also made it in 7.3 easier to register buttons isn't that great so here I have um a button file that I want to bring into CL and register I'm going to go to materials button register button here I can go in and select my file and what's really great is I'm able to select the button and the mesh so that I can register them both individually so button and thread so here I'm going to select my first mesh which is the button and then I'm going to say and my thread is number two that way they can both be separate but I'll register them together again my button is one and my thread is number two making it so I can also adjust them separately too I can then adjust and add in the different sizes if I had them and I can also adjust the specifications as well and change around the access conversion too everything's pretty good here though and I'm going to hit okay and now I've registered my button I can then go here and go to my dropdown and select the C button that I just registered button thread look at that and here I have it we've updated buttons so now you're actually able to desaturate them here I have my button that I've registered and everything and I have this color that I want to change it to and apply but I might like the texture I picked is a little bit dark so what I'm going to do is I'm going to hit desaturate and now I can change out the color so that it can be any color I want and I can start to adjust and play around with this pretty great but yeah now you have that check boox for Des saturate for buttons it's pretty easy right we've all been waiting for it and it's finally here you're now able to edit your zipper links within your 3D window by just wait for it clicking The Edge and dragging and you can do that on both sides you can just click and drag and then wow like magic it's just GNA move pretty great it's the little things in life I think so now that this is moved up I can again select it drag it down and you can keep editing and adjusting it like so that's a great new update you're G to be so excited so here as you can see I've got a ad print on top of a fabric and everything over in my object browser so here I've got my Fabric and then I have an all over print on top of it and what you also see is like those little cracks and everything you don't really see on top of that print so you're probably like What's Happening Here well guess what remember in the old workflow where you would have to like copy the path of the normal map that you found and then paste it onto this see you would have to go and open up the normal map and then figure out and make sure that they all aligned not anymore just check this button on use same normal map as Fabric and it's done look at that let's do it again just so we all can see it happen together so I'm going to uncheck no normal Maps check normal Maps that's it that's all isn't that look at that pretty amazing and if you scale the normal map in the fabric right like or if you change the intensity or anything it will then apply to the all over print but it's on top because it's linked see linked right out so I can change the intensity it applies to them both I can change the size it applies to them both I can do anything my heart desires and it will apply to both as long as that linked on is happening pretty great we've updated our edit texture tool to allow you to now match up with the grain line for symmetric pattern pieces so let's Jump On In to figure out how this works so first I'm going to go to my edit texture tool over here to the right and now what I'll do is I'll select my pattern piece and I'll see my symmetrical pattern and I'll right click and I'll say match up green this will then allow me to select any line and it'll ma um magically and automatically match up both the symmetrical pattern pieces together this will even work for my button plet here so here I can select this right click match up and I could select my internal line or my pattern outline here and they will match up together I could then start to maybe like move this because maybe I wanted this to match up more with my shirt so here I can select and move this up and down and then I can again select my other pattern piece right click and match up to green and then it will match up just know that this will not reflect in the print layout it is only for visual here in your 3D window this will also work for pattern pieces that are not symmetric too so here I have these side panels here that are not symmetric but I can select it right click match up to grain and I can use one of my pattern pieces that are symmetrical or anything or I can use my other pattern pieces and match it up and then it will match up perfectly as you can see here and I again can do the same here right click match up grain and it'll all match up we have changed our colorway editor a bit the look and the workflow with colorway editor are very similar to past ones however we've changed quite a bit on the back end we still find the colorway editor with an editor colorway but what we have done now is we've split up colorways so every time you add in a colorway like so you're actually making a complete new style almost this is so you can actually add different fabric Properties or different um Graphics or something like that two different colorways without having everything linked together so some of the things you'll see differently when we're doing that is now there's a little icon next to on the top of the object browser that's like the two little droplets that is going to show you that there is more colorways than what you're seeing right now so basically that's saying like do you want to see all of the fabrics and from All colorways Because you're only going to see in your object browser by default the Fabrics in the color way that you have selected right now you can actually see that because the faat workor names have changed so here I have colorway one and over in my object browser it says Fabric and then default colorway one well as before it just said default so all of the Fabrics whenever you're adding in a new colorway will actually copy the colorway name in which it's being used in so here it's default fabric colorway one but if I switch toor color way you'll just see default fabric denim raw rib 2 by two and all of that you'll also see the name difference within the colorway editor as well not just in the property editor not just in the object browser when I click this button here you'll then see again all the Fabrics that are in all colorways that you have here and when you click it again you'll just see the Fabrics within the color way you selected now the fun thing that's been changed is again you can now start to really have separate information so I can change out this name here and as you can see this will not affect the last color way I can make a whole new color way here I can change out the colors just like before so you can change out the color hit apply and just like before nothing's going to affect the old one great a whole new color way now and if I hit add it will then copy this color way to my next one and again now I'll see the name change so it says change name and everything I can then show all of my Fabrics again that are in all colorways or not what is important to know is if I change this colorway name here my fabric names will not update see they're still the same like it still says change fabric name colorway night two colorway two colorway two it will not change to when I change the colorway name what's really cool here is I can change out different fabric properties and it will not adjust the other fabric the other colorways which is really great I can also drag and drop completely new Fabrics in my object browser and again it will not affect other colorways one big difference though is you cannot drag and drop directly into the colorway editor you have to do it in the object browser I can change out all these Fabrics right make it completely different it's not probably something you want to do since then this would probably need a different pattern but it's something now you have the ability to do so if you want like a Heather within your colorways or anything like that you can and now that I have this colorway that is very different fabrics and everything I might want to simulate to see how this all looks and what you'll see is now it's going to adjust with the simulation because I've picked such different fabric properties from what I had before let's go even more extreme and do like a silk knit for this skirt and you'll start to see how this will really adjust and change I can go back to leather and simulate I also now can add in some graphics so what I'm going to do is add in a few different graphic options here and this really nice update is here I'm going to bring in this graphic apply it onto this color way change and adjust this placement and now I can go back to my color way here of course all of these are the graphics is now applied to all the colorways I can hide them if I want to or what I can do now is I can change it out so let's say I want to change out this colorway with a different graphic this is now really big before we would have to have two another whole graphic but now what you can do is switch it in this color way resize it and everything and it will not affect the other colorway at all the only things that will be affected is position so it'll make sure that the positions match up because they're the supposed to be in the same position but the size will be exactly the will be completely different so I can make this pineapple really big and update and you can still see that the other one the other graphic stays small so this is really great update because now you don't have to have so many different um Graphics you can just have like one or two if you want to and again you can hide a graphic if you don't want it in that color way or not yeah there's a lot with this update we will have a guide to come and there will also be a in-depth video video to come as well for this so with all these updates to our colorway editor we've also made it so that when you go to save image colorway editor the naming for this will also update as well so we got a lot of feedback that you didn't want the numbers you wanted the color way so now when you create these and you have all separate images you'll actually get the underscore colorway name instead of underscore and then number one number two number three so here I can hit save and as you can see now the naming is now color way blue color way um or just color way and then the numbers so we've added in in some updates to our UV editor with auto packing so let's go through this over here in our UV editor I have all of these like patterns all like separated out and before I would have to like resize them put them all in zero to zero but now I can just select this Auto UV packing tool and it will automatically pack all of my pattern pieces in into one square the 0 to one with as much efficiency as possible so we're really happy about this update it'll make your lives a lot easier thank you so much for watching this webinar we hope you enjoyed it we hope that this will improve so much in your life hopefully who knows um if you have any questions again please use the comment section below one of our great 3D designers will get back to you and don't forget to like And subscribe there's so many great videos to come that we already have and stay tuned for some indepth videos about some of these great new key features and highlight features that we have for you ",

        "Transcript": "today I will be teaching you about using image maps to create Fabrics in clo to demonstrate we will create this chain mail fabric since it uses all six of the image map options if you'd like to follow along download the images Linked In the description below let's start by looking at a clo fabric from the library I have one of the 3D Shape avatars and a pattern piece in my workspace and by default it is using fabric one in the object browser this fabric does not have any image Maps also this fabric does not have a realworld equivalent as it relates to its physical properties note the physical properties at the bottom here just custom these are the settings applied to the CL default fabric one I'm going to use the target here here to place the fabric piece on top of this shape and simulate while it is simulating and the fabric is selected I'm going to drag cotton heavy canvas onto the pattern piece in the 3D window note how the drape of the fabric changes this is because the physical properties of the fabric are different from before if I zoom in in the 3D window I can see now that it looks like cotton heavy canvas this is because the fabric has two image Maps applied select the fabric in the object browser and let's look at our property editor first the texture this is the color information this would be the equivalent of a scan or a photo of a piece of fabric the normal map this adds the illusion of threedimensional G geometry most of the Fabrics in the CL Library have either no Maps or just a texture and normal map Furs and Sherpas will use either the fur Properties or a displacement map more on that soon normal maps all look very similar in terms of color as this is how the software creates the illusion of the surface of the fabric although the example we are using here is to create a fabric the techniques can also be applied to Graphics buttons button holes top stitching and trims beyond the Assets in the object browser you can also edit the Avatar and its accessories as well the key is understanding which image map to place in what spot in the property Editor to help us we will create this chain mail fabric I chose this because it uses all six of the image Maps let's continue to work with the cotton heavy canvas but let's remove the texture and the normal maps by clicking the trash can icon to the far right of the preview icon here if you simulate you will notice that the fabric drape stays the same but it now looks blank we're going to have some fun and work some with some image maps that will allow us to create this chain mail fabric I chose this because we can use all of these image maps in all the areas here in the property editor texture normal displacement opacity roughness and metalness here is what these images look like based on the way the color and contrast are used each one will have its own effect on the fabric although a normal map is shown here CL can automatically create this so it is not necessary to have a separate image to get the effect when placed in the corresponding areas of the property editor here are the effects that are added each image map has been added to its own fabric in the proper area the image you're looking at is a render when we then view this in the 3 window the effects may be considerably different note this visual here in our CL 3 3D workspace most notable are the displacement roughness and metalness Maps little or no change to the surface of these particular patterns in these images we can get a little better understanding of what happens when the images are applied see how the normal map gives you the illusion of depth while the displacement map actually displaces the surface of the mesh each image simply needs to be added to the correct area displacement roughness and metalness settings can be adjusted to affect the appearance download the image maps from the link below and unzip and extract that folder you can add them to the library as I have done here or put them in your documents or desktop either way just remember the location let's open the understanding image Maps project included here as you can see there are eight Fabrics six of them have individual image Maps applied I'm going to select the final Fabric in the object browser in the property editor physical property choose a fabric that will give you the drape properties you are looking for I'm again going to choose cotton heavy twill so it does not have much stretch simulate so your fabric red drapes important place all image maps in before you decide to use the edit texture tool drag from the library onto the fabric in the 3D window CL will ask you which map you would like to place for now choose texture you can add the normal map in the same way or if you simply adjust the intensity in the object browser CL will create a normal map from the texture note that the two are now linked if you do this if you delete the texture the normal map is removed if you will be placing a displacement map you can bypass adding the normal map if you would like now I'm going to bring the folder with the textures to the front over CL you can drag them right from here there's my displacement map I'm going to put these right on these four little squares I call this the gallery you can also click the gallery and it will open a window and you can browse to your image Maps I will do this for the opacity map under reflection change the intensity to map in the drop-down and add the roughness map and finally add the metalness map if you would like to change the scale of the texture image maps you can now do so with the edit texture tool in either window to help us create the proper visualization of our fabric let's use interactive render go to the render menu and choose render click to begin the interactive render rotate your window so it's angled similar to what you see here and your render window is then filled with our chain mail in the image properties change the size of either the width or the height to match the other this will create a square image our fabric is not very exciting yet we need to make some adjustments to three of our image maps you can activate desaturate in the texture image map this will remove color and leave a grayscale texture this would work if you then also change the color down there below of the displacement map under displacement map change the amount here to 7 mm this particular image is a high quality image so a higher value will give you a good result if you have a low quality image you may need to keep this value at 2 to 3 mm raise the map intensity of the roughness map to 75 and check the box to invert also change the reflection intensity and metalness to 75 you can experiment with the values of these adjustments so that you get the desired effect once you're happy with your changes and it is finished previewing stop the interactive render click the save current image button Note the location and assign a name in the property editor edit the name and anything else you would like in this information section click save at the top of the property editor this small window will open click add custom image then click the plus sign go to where you just saved the image and open it then click okay choose a location to save your fabric you should save it to a different folder than the CL default Fabrics I will save mine here with my chain mail images you have just created a material in this case a fabric from scratch and saved it so you can use it in all of your designs ",
        "Summary": "## Comprehensive Guide to Creating Fabrics Using Image Maps in CLO This guide will walk you through the process of creating a chain mail fabric in CLO using various image maps. We will cover definitions, step-by-step instructions, and tips to help you effectively use image maps in your fabric designs. ### Definitions 1. **Image Maps**: Images that are used to define the surface properties of a fabric. Common types include: - **Texture Map**: The color and pattern of the fabric. - **Normal Map**: Provides the illusion of depth and texture on the surface. - **Displacement Map**: Physically alters the mesh to create surface details. - **Opacity Map**: Defines transparency levels in the fabric. - **Roughness Map**: Determines how rough or smooth the surface appears. - **Metalness Map**: Indicates which parts of the fabric should reflect light like metal. 2. **Physical Properties**: Attributes that define how a fabric behaves in terms of drape, stretch, and texture. ### Step-by-Step Instructions #### Step 1: Set Up Your Workspace 1. Download the image maps linked in the description. 2. Open CLO and load a 3D Shape avatar and a pattern piece into your workspace. 3. Check the object browser to see that the fabric is using the default ‚ÄúFabric 1‚Äù which currently has no image maps. #### Step 2: Inspect Default Fabric Properties 1. Select the fabric in the object browser. 2. Open the property editor and note the physical properties (these are set as custom). #### Step 3: Apply a Pre-Defined Fabric 1. Select the fabric piece in the 3D window. 2. Drag the \"Cotton Heavy Canvas\" from the library onto the pattern piece. 3. Simulate the fabric to observe changes in drape. #### Step 4: Remove Existing Image Maps 1. With the fabric selected, go to the property editor. 2. Click the trash can icon next to the texture and normal maps to remove them. 3. Simulate again to see that the fabric appears blank but has the same drape. #### Step 5: Create Chain Mail Fabric 1. Prepare to apply image maps for the chain mail fabric using all six types. 2. Download and unzip the chain mail image maps if you haven‚Äôt already. #### Step 6: Add Image Maps 1. In the property editor, locate the sections for each image map. 2. Drag and drop the corresponding image maps onto the appropriate fields: - **Texture Map**: Drag the texture image here. - **Normal Map**: Drag the normal map here (or let CLO create it automatically from the texture). - **Displacement Map**: Drag the displacement map here. - **Opacity Map**: Drag the opacity map here. - **Roughness Map**: Drag the roughness map here. - **Metalness Map**: Drag the metalness map here. #### Step 7: Adjust Image Map Settings 1. Change the intensity values for the normal map and other maps as needed. 2. Select the material properties for the fabric that provide the desired drape (e.g., Cotton Heavy Twill). 3. Adjust displacement settings (e.g., set displacement to 7 mm for high-quality images). #### Step 8: Interactive Rendering 1. Go to the render menu and select \"Render.\" 2. Start the interactive render and adjust the view to see the fabric. 3. Resize the render window to maintain a square aspect ratio (adjust width or height). #### Step 9: Fine-Tune Your Fabric 1. Experiment with desaturating the texture image to achieve a grayscale effect. 2. Adjust the roughness map intensity to around 75 and check the invert option. 3. Set reflection intensity and metalness to 75 as well. #### Step 10: Save Your Fabric 1. Once satisfied with the fabric's appearance, stop the interactive render. 2. Save the current image by clicking the ‚ÄúSave Current Image‚Äù button. 3. Assign a name and note the save location. 4. In the property editor, click ‚ÄúAdd Custom Image‚Äù and navigate to your saved image. 5. Save your fabric in a dedicated folder separate from CLO default fabrics. ### Tips and Tricks - **Image Quality**: Higher quality images will yield better results, especially for displacement maps. - **Experiment**: Don‚Äôt hesitate to experiment with different values and settings to achieve the desired visual effects. - **Backup**: Regularly save your work and create backups of your fabric designs. - **Documentation**: Keep notes on the settings used for each fabric to replicate successful designs in the future. By following these steps, you will have successfully created a complex chain mail fabric using image maps in CLO, ready for use in your designs. Happy designing!"

        "publishedAt": "2023-10-26T13:00:11Z",
        "Transcript": "hi everybody so today in this video or this clove tutorial we're going to be talking about the vertical toggle menus which are in both our 2D and 3D Windows if you've ever been curious those vertical toggles are in both our 3D window in the upper leftand corner and also in the upper leftand corner of our 2D window and we're just going to go through a full breakdown of what each of these do and show us at the very top of our 3D one we have something called quality render and the quality render when we turn this on just adjusts the lighting in our scene which we can see pretty quickly when we turn this on we've suddenly got a much more realistic lighting and kind of I like to think of as a preview to my Lighting in my render window and all again all of these are just click on or off the next one below is our schematic render and this one is really great for what we call 3D Flats pattern accurate Flats great for sketch review and showing off your sketches and when you turn this tool on you do get a popup menu where you can actually choose how you're going to view everything for the schematic render including silhouette lines seam lines internal lines top stitching lines the line color can be changed currently I just have it set to Black and as well you can also change it to just a color version to see it all in white and lastly you can adjust the brightness or color below just going to Simply click the X to exit out of this view next here we have our garment display and this is has everything to do with how we are visually viewing the garments in this window again we're not actually going to physically change anything about these garments it's just visually how we are viewing things the first one when we come over is to show garment the shortcut is shift W and again this just toggles our garment on and off pretty simple the next one we have here is called show archive patterns now currently I do not have any archive patterns but of course we're going to show you what that means if I select let's say my cardigan in 2D or in 3D in the 3D window I can right click on these patterns and come to this option archive or in the 2D window I can right click on a pattern piece in 2D come down to where it says 3D pattern select archive and now the pattern pieces become invisible in our 3D window and become an outline of the pattern pieces in our 2D window they are still completely there they are just hidden and the nice thing is if we choose to want to bring these pattern pieces back we simply go back to our 3D garment display go to the second button over show archive patterns and bring it back pretty nice and simple next what we have is our showing 3D seam lines the third button over shortcut shift s and this if you pay attention to her shoulder seam here we see a very clear shoulder seam and armhole seam and when I go ahead and toggle that off those seams disappear basically CL hides the normal maps that create those seams this this is a great trick if you are creating a pattern or a sweater that you want to have the visual look of being seamless the next one we have over here is our showing internal lines so right now I currently have them toggled off but internal lines are those red lines we can have on our garment which when I turn back on we can see in my 3D window the red outline for my patch pocket and the same we can see those red lines in my 2D I'm go ahead and turn those back off next we have show Basel lines Basel lines are those purple markings that we can use on our pattern pieces as well we can see here those purple lines in 3D marking off the edge for my placket button area and we can also see those lines again in the 2D window next we have our show 3D pen garment when we turn it on this is going to give us that ability to actually see those 3D pens on our clothing or garments and those tools are right here on our 3D garment pen so if I go ahead and turn one of these tools on maybe just I want to mark off a possible future princess seam let's say I'm going to add in that line the line is going to appear in our 3D window in our 2D window it'll appear here momentarily to be marked out there it is but what's nice is if I choose to not want this I can of course toggle that back off and those tools are again on our 3D toolbar right here the 3D pen garment tool after that we have the ability to show threads or our sewing lines when I toggled this on and I actually usually leave this on most of the time if we want to see what that actually is doing I can simply select a pattern piece for example the patch pocket and if I pull it away from the Garment I see all of those different sewing threads right here that we can view and of course if I turn those sewing threads off for show threads they are invisible but still there just going to really quickly choose that superimpose over option in my 3D window to snap that pocket back into place and simulate for a second there we go back into place perfect the next one we have is there's option to show pins and Sh pins will show in our 3D window in bright red I can see I have a few little pins here to hold her straps up currently as well as some pins which are holding the cardigan in place and our pin tool also is normally on our 3D toolbar right here looks like a pin with a square right there from that one we have two more tools for measurements one is our show garment measure tool and when I turn this tool on I can see this green line has appeared in between my cardigan opening and our show garment measuring tools are here again on our 3D toolbar and these can be used to measure openings and distances between garments the last tool that we have is our show 2D measurement and this one is what shows us our 2D or pom point of measure measurements in our 3D window so right here I can see I have the length of the sleeve as well as her bicep measured out in the 3D window and these are going to correspond to my 2D pattern piece over here those P tools exist on our 2D toolbar right here as well as we have our pom tab in the object browser it is the one farthest to the right if we continue down the next tab down is our 3D trims display the first one is the show button and we'll just zoom in really quick on her if I choose to turn buttons off by clicking we no longer see the buttons or the button holes I can go ahead and turn those back on the next tool we have is show piping and if I just zoom into her pocket right here I'm going to take this from being off to turning it back on and now we you can see there is actually piping around the edge of the pocket bag here so we can turn piping on and off as well we have this option called show Bond SLC and when we turn on our show bonding Sky there we go we'll see this kind of orange glow on her pocket bags which is letting us know visually that bonding has been applied to these pieces we also see that exact same orange glow on our 2D pattern pieces as well it is is important to note that you can visually hide bonding in 3D but it's always going to remain on in the 2D window next from there we have the ability to show or hide our puckering I've applied puckering to the seams of her skirt and you'll notice when I toggle it on and off how the shadowing or puckering appears and disappears the final one here is the ability to show or hide Trims and you'll notice that the Buckle at her waist which has been applied as a trim will appear or disappear when I turn this tool on as long as your object has been added as a trim this tool will work the next one we have down this is the fifth one down is our Avatar display first and most importantly is our show Avatar shortcut shift a if we click that we can hide or unhide our Avatar after that we have our handy Arrangement points and these are how we arrange our pattern pieces around our Avatar this works in conjunction with the next tool over show bounding volume so when you attach or wrap a pattern piece let's say a sleeve around the arm it when you place the sleeve it actually then follows the green circle around her arm so it knows how tight or loose to wrap it from there we have our show x-ray joints shift X and this will allow us to see our skeleton and actually even be able to select the joints and adjust from there we have our show Avatar measurements when we click this on we can see all the standard measur measurements on our Avatar and you can of course always add more or different measurements as well with the Avatar measuring tools again located on our 3D toolbar the last one here is show 3D pen Avatar we can see when I turn this tool on there is a line actually drawn down the center front of our Avatar right at her collar bone and those tools again have to do with our 3D avatar pen tools again on our 3D toolbar really though some of the most important ones that we can have turned on or off or change between are our Fabrics there are two that most often are used our thick textured surface and our textured surface these two are most often used and the biggest difference is one shows the fabric thickness and one does not if we are on show thick textured surface I'm going to zoom into her the cardigan opening here we can actually see a clear amount of thickness that is on our Fabric and if we switch from thick textured surface to textured surface suddenly we no longer see the thickness of the material and if we go ahead and quickly hide our Avatar you'll notice that the inside of the Garment or pattern pieces are all gray what this tool does is textured surface leaves the texture on the outside but Grays out the reverse or back side of our material so we know the right side and the wrong side of our materials which can be super helpful I'm going to go to our next one though from there we have monochromatic surface which will turn our entire garment gray we have translucent surface so we can now see inside of our garment and completely through it mesh surface which allows us to view the mesh of our garments thick textured surface back which allows us to see the reverse or interior portions and finally my personal favorite random colored surface which will randomly color your pattern pieces which is especially helpful if you may be have a garment that has one color but many pattern pieces you can now clearly see all of those different pattern pieces defined I'm going to switch back to the one I work most often in though again which is that thick textured surface or shortcut alt one next here the third from the bottom are our garment fit Maps we do have videos that go in depth to these but the different ones are our stress map the next one over is our strain map from there we have our fit map and last but not least our show pressure points map so these are really great Maps when you start to actually fit your garment we're going to go ahead and turn our Avatar back on by clicking show Avatar and here we have our textured surface currently our Avatar has a texture or a skin applied so we can see what she looks like you can actually switch to a monochromatic surface which is going to make the avatar look more like a mannequin or you could even turn on a mesh view of the Avatar which shows the Avatar's mesh the very last toggle is is for environment displays we have show 3D light this is more so for if you have any Lighting in your render engine apply we can actually see her little dome light right at the center of her feet but this would allow you to actually adjust and move the lights around without going into the render engine next we have show light render which makes sense this one's for the actual rendered lights we can see we have a few box lights as well as globe lights here or sphere lights from there we have our show wind controller this is fun if you ever want to play with or add wind to a scene you can actually turn on and adjust wind we have our show ground grid which can be toggled on and off as well as just a show grid which creates a grid over the entire scene and now we're going to go ahead and just move over last but not least to this is our 2D vertical toggle tools now most often people leave most of these off because you will notice pretty quickly that your scene or window can become quite crowded quite quickly at the very top we have our 2D sewing display one which shows all of our sewing that has been applied or added to the Garment next showing top stitching that's been applied or added and also puckering which has been applied or added to the Garment what's really nice though is I don't worry too much about leaving these turned on because when I actually go to those corresponding tools our sewing tools our top stitching tools or our puckering tools when we go to those individual tools CL will actually show us all of that for example when I've turned on my edit sewing tool I now actually see all of the sewing from there we have our 2D pattern display our very first one showing baselines and again we can see those baselines on the front of our garment right at the placket area which can be toggled on and off we have our show seam allowance this garment has seam allowance added to it so we can see that or choose to not not see it if your garment has grading applied you can choose to show grading or not from there we have our show 3D pen so that line that we added to the front of our bodice right there we can toggle on and off show reference lines is a really nice tool to have so if we have show reference toggled on and let's say we choose to make it edit I'm just going to quickly shorten the sleeve for a second CH is going to leave behind a reference line for us to see what the original size or measurements were of that pattern piece giving CL just a second to think so it can show me and it looks like I maybe forgot to turn it on but that is not a problem cuz that gives me an opportunity to show you guys the tool I can select my sleeve here or maybe a simpler quicker thing I will select my pocket I'm going to rightclick and I'm going to start working my way down here till I come to clone as reference line again I just right clicked on the entire pattern piece and chose clone as reference line and now when I change my pocket bag width I can see here clone is Left Behind a gray outline that's giving me a reference point for what the original pattern piece was zooming back out those are the 2D pattern display options right here oh almost forgot one actually the last but not least of these is show symmetric instance line so if you have cloned or half symmetric patterns with that blue glow or with half symmetry patterns that dash line you can actually toggle those options on and off next here we have our 2D information display the first option we have is to show pattern names so we can see all the different names our pattern pieces were are being called we have pattern annotation which is really nice so we have our annotation tools on our 2D toolbar if you ever want to add notes or annotations to your pattern pieces from there we have our show line length so this you you can see how it can become quickly quite busy but we see each individual segment length we have show Grain Lines where we now see the grain line on all the individual pattern pieces marked out for us show 2D measurement again that is going to be these lines here or pom on our sleeve that can be added individually from there we have a show ruler which will be a ruler guide on our 2D window and what's nice is you can right click on the ruler to adjust to inches ctim and millimet and last here is the show guidelines which when we start to move pattern pieces around you'll see those pink guidelines appear from there we again have fabric views which we can turn on front textured surface it's just going to show again the front textured surface we do have monochromatic surface which will show all our pattern pieces in white the next one over translucent surface is really helpful this is great great if you're walking or bringing pattern pieces one on top of the other so we can actually see how they are starting to line up of course using a sleeve is not the greatest example but maybe I want to actually line up pattern pieces like side seams for the front and back bodice especially helpful when walking patterns let's click on that from there we have transparent surface so this is just a completely sheer view show mesh view so we can see the mesh here showing back textured surface this is really helpful if you want to ever see maybe a graphic on the interior portion of your garment and here I can see that there is a little CL graphic tag added to the back collar of her cardan and again my personal favorite random colored surface will just randomly color all of your pattern pieces of course most often you will be in front textured surface at the very bottom our last toggle in our 2D is our lock patterns options which give you the option to lock your pattern outlines lock your internal lines lock your baselines and lock your guidelines I hope that all of you have found this super helpful in explaining what both the 3D and 2D vertical toggle are and of course if you have any questions feel free to put it in the comments for us to answer later thank you so much bye ",

        "Summary": "## Comprehensive Guide to Creating a Loop Shape and Adding Buttons in a 3D Design Software This guide will walk you through the process of creating loop shapes and adding buttons to your design using a polygon tool in a 3D design software. Follow the step-by-step instructions to achieve a neat and stylish look for your fabric-based project. ### Step 1: Create the Loop Shape 1. **Open Your Design Software**: Launch your 3D design software and open a new project. 2. **Select the Polygon Tool**: Locate the polygon tool in your toolbar. This tool allows you to create various shapes by defining points. 3. **Draw the Loop Shape**: - Click to create your first point on the workspace. - Continue clicking to define the shape of the loop. Make sure to create a closed shape. - Once you have the desired loop shape, ensure it has nice curves and edges. 4. **Adjust Settings**: - Assign the loop shape to a fabric type. In this case, select ‚ÄúCotton Sateen‚Äù from your fabric options. - Make sure the material matches the rest of your design for a cohesive look. 5. **Duplicate the Loop**: - To create additional loops, you can use the copy and paste function: - Select the loop shape. - Press **Ctrl + C** (Copy) followed by **Ctrl + V** (Paste) to create a duplicate. - Repeat this step until you have a total of five loops. ### Step 2: Position the Loops 1. **Align the Loops**: - Start positioning the loops on your design. - It‚Äôs often best to start from the center and move outward for symmetry. 2. **Simulation Settings**: - To see how the loops will behave, turn on the simulation feature in your software. This will allow the loops to snap into place based on physics and fabric behavior. ### Step 3: Add Buttons 1. **Access the Button Tool**: - Find the button tool in the 3D toolbar. This tool is typically located near the polygon tool. 2. **Setting Button Position**: - Right-click on the button tool for precision settings. - Navigate to the ‚ÄúPosition‚Äù settings and set the distance from the edge of the loop to 2 units. 3. **Create Buttons**: - Similar to the loops, you can create buttons using Ctrl + C and Ctrl + V. - Decide how many buttons you want to add (in this case, five total). - Position each button at equal intervals along the loops for a balanced look. ### Step 4: Finalize the Design 1. **Turn on Simulation Again**: - After positioning the buttons, turn on the simulation feature once more to see how they interact with the loops and fabric. 2. **Review Your Design**: - Zoom in and out to ensure all elements are properly aligned and visually appealing. - Make any necessary adjustments to the size or position of the loops and buttons. 3. **Save Your Project**: - Don‚Äôt forget to save your work frequently to avoid losing any changes. ### Tips and Tricks - **Use Gridlines**: Enable gridlines in your workspace to help position your loops and buttons accurately. - **Layering**: If your software supports layers, use them to separate different parts of your design, making it easier to edit. - **Experiment with Colors**: Try different colors or patterns for your loops and buttons to see what complements your fabric best. - **Use Reference Images**: If you're not sure how the loops and buttons should look, use reference images from online sources as guides. - **Practice**: The more you use the tools, the more comfortable you will become. Don‚Äôt hesitate to experiment with different shapes and sizes. ### Conclusion By following these steps, you can successfully create loop shapes and add buttons to enhance your fabric design. With practice, you will become proficient in using the polygon tool and manipulating objects within your design software. Enjoy the creative process and have fun designing!"

        "Transcript": "hi everyone welcome back with another video and today we are going to be going over how to create those looped button holes or attached little pieces pattern pieces that are attached to Loop in order to then fasten buttons and since we can't use normal button holes for this we'll be making everything starting at the beginning and if you take a look at my screen we already have a dress which is sewn together ready for the buttons to be added now with most button holes they have a little modest panel that's going to be at the back this is so that when those buttons pull across there is still that little panel there the fabric so the person skin does not show through we have just the two bodice pieces on either side similar to when we fasten buttons and close sometimes it can be a little bit easier to actually sew that seam shut at the beginning so that you can then have everything be as stable as possible so I'm just going to quickly use my free sewing to go ahead and sew these two sides together on the bodice right here once I have that done I am going to make sure to change my sewing angle from Custom to turn just to make sure everything is as stable as possible and this panel doesn't end up pushing forward or through and letting that simulate shut Perfect all right so now that we have that set up so it's quoting to be quite stable we can go ahead and start to add in our pattern pieces so I pre-made a little Loop pattern piece which I'm going to Simply add in in order to make this all I did was really use our polygon tool to create a loop shape you can of course create actual pattern pieces that fold over they just take a little bit more time to do uh right when I bring that in I can see that my pattern piece came in at that default particle distance of 20 since this is such a small pattern piece if I zoom in right here as well might be a good idea again to go ahead and change that right away so I'm going to go into my pattern pieces property editor on the right hand side and under that particle distance I'm going to change it from the default 20 to two now when you change anything below five you are going to get this little popup just letting you know that you made something very small and it can slow down simulation process but of course with a pattern piece this small it should not do that with your computer and now I can actually see that pattern piece creating that nice Loop shape and I'm also going to reassign it to a cotton saene that I'm using for my fabric so right there it's ready to go and it's going to actually match my material I do need a couple more of these Loops so now I'm going to go ahead and just start to copy them simple crl C contrl + V since I am on a PC now I can left click to just Place one or if I right click I can start to actually say how many I want and how far apart do I want them to be I know ahead of time I want my Loops to be 1 and 1/4 in apart so my interval I'm going to set to 1 and a/4 and as well as the number of shapes going to add in four additional ones for a total of five Loops great and if I zoom out I can see all of those Loops right there before I forget to do this again with such small pattern pieces I'm going to add in that temporary strengthening by selecting all five of those Loops right clicking and then coming down to strengthening and this is just going to add in a little bit of extra stability you'll notice that right off the bat they haven't actually changed color I like to work with this turned off this is very up to you if you right click in the gray space of your 3D window you'll notice that if you come down to show hide color you can choose to hide the color freeze blue strengthen which is going to be that orangey color or solidify which is gray so I like to actually hide them all right off the bat but you can also always turn that off as well all right now that I have my Loops all ready to go I'm ready to sew them and I'm going to use my free sewing tool shortcut is M and you'll notice on my pattern piece this left side of the bod I have just markings where each of these Loops is going to be sewn to and for this process I'm going to sew from the center here up and then starting at that segment point and going up I'm going to do the exact same thing for the lower portion starting at the top and coming down and then coming back to that seg point top down I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to do that for all of my remaining little Loops right here this really only takes usually a minute or so the nice thing is since I am working with the free sewing it does give me that little blue picking dot because I'm set starting with that length that I already know the edge of the loop and coming upward it gives me again that little blue picking dot if I zoom in right there you can see right above my cursor that darker Blue Dot right there just make sure that my sewing ends up perfectly even all right awesome now that I have all of my SE done on all of these I could of course go ahead and simulate but there's a few more steps again that are just going to help with making sure nothing becomes unstable later on the first and a really key one here is to go to my edit sewing tool and marking over all of that sewing that I just added at the end of the loop I'm going to change their sewing line type from Custom to turned just to make sure that these don't try to press open as well as then going ahead and selecting all of my loops and in the 3D window right clicking and I'm going to choose that option superimpose side and they're all just going to snap next to where they actually belong next right next to the bodice of that Center Front seam and use my Gizmo to just pull them a little forward before I simulate one last really nice trick especially with these teeny tiny Loop pattern pieces is the tacking tool this tacking tool when I select it I'm going to basically tack the end of my Loop to the bodice this is really just going to make sure that when I added my buttons later on that they stay in place and do not end up flipping through or clipping through my button later on again just a quick click on the end of my Loop and to my bodice and I can also always double check that in the 2D window and right off the bat I can see I actually messed up on one of these but it I think it should be actually just fine but what's also really nice is you can always edit it using your edit Tac tool and I can go ahead and select any t I want to delete so that I can start over see right here this one actually just ended up T to itself so I messed up on two of them again nice thing with clo is if you mess up you can always fix it later on there we go fixing one and this time making sure I actually tag it to the underneath garment all right with all of these tacked one last thing I want to do is they look a little thin and again normally this is some sort of spaghetti material so I'm going to select all of those Loops come over to my property editor and and I'm going to add in an additional thickness rendering going to go with two I think that actually looks like a little too much then so I can always reduce that think one that looks pretty good and of course I can always edit shape of my pattern pieces later on with all of that done I'm going to zoom out a little and I'm going to go ahead and hit my space bar to turn on simulation and let those snap into place perfect they all look exactly how I really want them to look and I'm ready I think to go ahead and stop my simulation and add in buttons our button tool is going to be over on our 3D toolbar I'm going to start with just that very first button literally it's called button button and coming over to my bodice again I have segment points marked out kind of where I want my buttons to hit but I know exactly how far I want it to be place so I'm going to instead of left clicking to place right click for precision when I come down to position I'm going to set it as 2 away from the edge for my very first one perfect I'm then going to switch to my select move button tool and similar to our how to fasten buttons down a placket I'm going to do contrl c contrl v I get a copy of my other button and if I hold shift they come straight down while I'm still holding shift I'm going to right click and I can now set my interval of how far apart I want these buttons to be I'm going to stick to 1 and 1/4 in and as well except how many buttons do I want to add so 1 2 3 4 and now I have a total of five buttons we can see them being added both 2D and 3D which is great and I can hit okay now that I have my buttons added in I already actually had a little shank button added in for me but of course we can always change that button later on simply by clicking your button in your object browser under your button Tab and if you remember we have lots of different buttons that you can choose from for your different styles and you can always add in custom buttons that you created yourself as well I think overall the size and the placement look really good one last thing I may want to do is again using my select move tool marking over all of my butt buttons before I let simulation happen I'm going to pull them a little forward again this is just going to make sure that when I simulate they're going to snap and not collide with those loops and I'm also going to adjust their thread length so this is really how far how much length do they have on that thread between the body of the Garment and the back of the button I'm just going to increase that to 0.1 so they have a little bit of extra space since this again is like a shank button it would probably have something similar to that and now that I've done that we can go ahead and hit space art on our computers to let that simulate and it looks like most of mine turn out just fine two of them decided to have a little snafu that is not a problem at all as we're saying if anything goes wrong and we've lost a few of our Loops we can always pull them out I'm going to start by just simply selecting them in my 3D or 2D window and pulling them forward so I can see where they've gone and I'm going to start by resetting that 2D arrangement we can see again my 2D Arrangement is right in front of that shadow of my avatar and then ch right clicking and again choosing superimposed side now that they are snapped back into place I can always pull them just a smidge bit forward with my Gizmo and turn on simulation again perfect and there we go they've nicely flattened out then they are back in place all of my Loops are actually across from my button holes one thing we can also do which does help to add in additional stability if you ever need it is to select all of your button Loops come over to the property editor and turn elastic on and set it to 100% this is going to prevent the loops from stretching out and maintaining their shape if they were made from fabric of course if instead they were actually made for maybe a small piece of elastic you could actually turn on that elastic to the percentage that you need them to be now that we have this portion set if you remember at the very beginning we sewed together our center Front seams so that they would hold together while we were creating this entire process I'm going to select that sewing and delete it letting CL load that in perfect and once CL has removed or deleted that sewing I can go ahead now and re simulate this actual piece so that these will start to separate let just get a nice view of that and again turning on simulation they're going to pull apart ever so slightly we can actually start to see the edge of that kind of little modesty panel that's underneath and we have created a cute little dress with some Loop buttons as closures I hope you guys enjoyed this video and of course if you have any questions let me know in the chat or if there's any other videos you would love to see in the future let me know that as well until next time thanks   again ",
        "Summary": "Creating looped buttonholes and attaching pattern pieces for button fastening is a valuable skill in garment design. This guide will break down the comprehensive steps, definitions, and tips based on the provided transcript. ### Comprehensive Guide to Creating Looped Buttonholes #### Materials Needed - Software for pattern design (e.g., CLO 3D) - Pre-sewn dress model - Loop pattern piece (you can create this using a polygon tool) - Fabric type (e.g., cotton satin) - Buttons (with shank if desired) ### Step-by-Step Instructions #### Step 1: Prepare Your Garment 1. **Initial Setup**: Open your garment design software and ensure your dress is already sewn together and ready for button additions. 2. **Back Panel**: Ensure that there is a modesty panel at the back to prevent skin from showing through when the buttons are fastened. #### Step 2: Sew Bodice Pieces Together 1. **Stabilize the Garment**: Use the free sewing tool (shortcut: **M**) to sew the two sides of the bodice together. This helps in stabilizing the garment. 2. **Sewing Angle**: Change your sewing angle from 'Custom' to 'Turn' to maintain stability. #### Step 3: Create Loop Pattern Pieces 1. **Using Polygon Tool**: Utilize the polygon tool to create a loop shape. For simplicity, you can create a basic loop shape instead of folding pattern pieces. 2. **Adjust Particle Distance**: In the pattern piece property editor, change the particle distance from 20 to 2 for small pieces. Confirm the popup warning about small size. 3. **Material Assignment**: Assign the loop pattern piece to the cotton satin fabric. #### Step 4: Duplicate Loops 1. **Copying Loops**: Use **Ctrl+C** and **Ctrl+V** to duplicate the loop pattern pieces. 2. **Set Interval and Count**: Right-click to set the interval to 1.25 inches and add a total of five loops. #### Step 5: Strengthening Loops 1. **Temporary Strengthening**: Select all loop pieces, right-click, and choose 'Strengthening' to add stability. 2. **Hide Colors**: Optionally, hide the different color states (freeze, strengthen, etc.) to streamline your workspace. #### Step 6: Sew Loops to Bodice 1. **Sewing Process**: Using the free sewing tool, sew each loop to the bodice starting from the center to ensure even alignment. 2. **Editing Sewing Lines**: After sewing, change the sewing line type from 'Custom' to 'Turn' to prevent them from opening up. #### Step 7: Superimpose Loops 1. **Positioning Loops**: Right-click on the loops and use 'Superimpose Side' to snap them next to the bodice seam. 2. **Tack Loops**: Use the tacking tool to secure the ends of each loop to the bodice to prevent any movement during simulation. #### Step 8: Adjust Loop Thickness 1. **Increasing Thickness**: In the property editor, increase the loop thickness to make them more realistic. Adjust as needed for visual appeal. #### Step 9: Simulate the Design 1. **Run Simulation**: Press the spacebar to simulate the garment and verify that the loops are in the correct position. 2. **Fix Any Issues**: If loops misbehave, select and reposition them using the 2D or 3D window. #### Step 10: Add Buttons 1. **Select Button Tool**: Use the button tool from the 3D toolbar to add buttons to the bodice. 2. **Positioning Buttons**: Right-click to set precise positions for buttons, ensuring they are placed correctly relative to the loops. 3. **Copying Buttons**: Use **Ctrl+C** and **Ctrl+V** to duplicate buttons, holding **Shift** for vertical alignment while adjusting intervals. #### Step 11: Final Adjustments and Simulation 1. **Adjust Button Thread Length**: Set the thread length for the buttons to ensure they sit correctly. 2. **Run Final Simulation**: Simulate the garment again to ensure all elements behave as expected. 3. **Remove Temporary Sewing**: Delete any initial temporary sewing used for stabilization to see the final design. ### Definitions - **Free Sewing Tool**: A tool used to sew pattern pieces together freely without specific constraints. - **Particle Distance**: Refers to the resolution of the simulation; smaller distances allow for more detail but may slow down the system. - **Tacking Tool**: A tool used to temporarily fix parts of the garment together during simulation. ### Tips and Tricks - **Stability**: Always ensure that small pieces are strengthened to avoid instability during simulation. - **Precise Placement**: Use right-click methods for precise placement of buttons and loops for accurate designs. - **Simulation Checks**: Run simulations frequently to catch any issues early in the design process. - **Undo Mistakes**: Use editing tools to fix any mistakes in placement or sewing to streamline your workflow. - **Experiment**: Don‚Äôt hesitate to try different materials or styles for loops and buttons to enhance your designs. By following these steps and utilizing the tips provided, you should be able to effectively create looped buttonholes and integrate them into your garment designs. Happy sewing!"
